EVTDESC_ZE_22900;You have invited your vassals to partake in a formal introduction of your heir, [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstName]. [introduced_heir.GetSheHeCap] will have to exchange many pleasantries and act in a very formal way, something that might be tiresome for someone as young as [introduced_heir.GetHerHim]. However, you have full confidence that [introduced_heir.GetSheHe] will not disappoint you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22901;The last of your vassals have left and [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstName] looks relieved. [introduced_heir.GetSheHeCap] is obviously exhausted from all the formalities, but having been introduced like this will hopefully serve [introduced_heir.GetHerHim] well in the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22902;[vassal_teacher.GetBestName] is a renowned godly and learned vassal of yours. After having introduced [vassal_teacher.GetHerselfHimself] to [introduced_heir.GetFirstName], [vassal_teacher.GetFirstName] approaches you with an offer. [vassal_teacher.GetFirstName] is willing to spend some time teaching [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] some of the more intricate parts of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] in exchange for your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22903;As [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] introduces [introduced_heir.GetHerselfHimself] to [compliment_vassal.GetBestName] [introduced_heir.GetSheHe] not only presents [introduced_heir.GetHerselfHimself] with grace, but also manages to impress [compliment_vassal.GetFirstName] by skillfully complimenting [compliment_vassal.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22904;As [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] introduces [introduced_heir.GetHerselfHimself] to [insult_vassal.GetBestName] [introduced_heir.GetSheHe] not only accidently spills a beverage on [insult_vassal.GetFirstName]'s shoes, but also manages to insult ALL of [insult_vassal.GetFirstName]'s ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22905;It seems as if [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] has started getting along incredibly well with the child of one of the visiting vassals! Indeed, apparently [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] and [befriended_child.GetBestName] are becoming fast friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22906;While having a pleasant conversation you are suddenly interrupted by an infernal ruckus, upon further investigation it seems as if [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] has gotten into a fight with the child of one of the visiting vassals! You tear the two children apart, but it is obvious that [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] and [rival_child.GetBestName] will not ever be friends after this encounter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22907;As the hours go by you notice [introduced_heir.GetFirstName]'s mood starting to drop. [introduced_heir.GetSheHeCap] is obviously trying [introduced_heir.GetHerHis] best to impress the visiting vassals, but it is evidently tearing at [introduced_heir.GetHerHim]. Hopefully this slump in [introduced_heir.GetFirstName]'s mood will pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22908;[vassal_teacher_martial.GetBestName] is a renowned fighter and tactician. After having introduced [vassal_teacher_martial.GetHerselfHimself] to [introduced_heir.GetFirstName], [vassal_teacher_martial.GetFirstName] approaches you with an offer. [vassal_teacher_martial.GetFirstName] is willing to spend some time teaching [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] how to fight in exchange for your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22909;It is evidently clear to all of the visiting vassals that [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstName] has been infatuated with [husband_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s wife, [wife_target.GetTitledFirstName]. While harmless, [introduced_heir.GetFirstName] is still following her around like a dog. [husband_target.GetFirstName] does not seem to be amused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_22900;They will be here soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22901;I've done my best to groom [introduced_heir.GetHerHim] into a worthy heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22902;Anything for [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22903;I taught [introduced_heir.GetHerHim] everything [introduced_heir.GetSheHe] knows!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22904;That kid is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22905;How lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22906;I wonder who started it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22907;Now, there are still more vassals to greet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22908;That would be useful, I will bestow my favor upon you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22909;There is no time for this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_22902;There is no need for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22908;Learn how to fight? There is no need for such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
