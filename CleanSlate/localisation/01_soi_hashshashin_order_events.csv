EVTDESC88000;Word is spreading that a [Root.Religion.GetName] missionary, Hassan-i Sabbah, has founded a religious order known as the 'Hashshashin' somewhere in western Persia. Using trickery and guile, this mysterious cult of trained killers has seized control of the mountain fortress of Alamut and converted it into their headquarters. Already a string of violent murders can be traced back to Hassan's devoted and fearless disciples...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88000_ASSASSIN;Finally, a new era of righteousness has begun. For many years we have worked in the shadows, but the rumors are no longer whispered. The name of 'Hassan-i Sabbah', the conqueror of our mountain fortress of Alamut, is known throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond. The faithful and meek shall find shelter under our wings while the impious and infidels shall fear our fury!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88001;The Hashshashin, the elusive Order of Assassins, have expanded their influence into Syria. A branch of their sect has established itself in the mountain fortress of Masyaf, from where they control the surrounding countryside. All across the Holy Land, the Assassins are now hunting those they see as obstacles to their obscure plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88001_ASSASSIN;News of our Order's successful occupation of the mountain fortress of Masyaf in Syria is spreading. Our enemies, the infidels and the impious, have begun to realize what they are dealing with. May they cower in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88002;With the fall of their last fortress, the Hashshashin - the notorious Assassin Order - has been scattered to the winds. The few remaining members of the order have gone into hiding, biding their time in the vain hope that they will one day be able to resume their work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88002_ASSASSIN;With the fall of our last fortress, our Order has been forced into hiding. Some may think this is the end, but they are fools. We have worked from the shadows before and will do so again. One day we shall rise again, mightier than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88003;The Hashshashin have returned! Somehow, throughout the years, their surviving members have managed to rebuild a measure of their order's former strength. Striking from the shadows, they have retaken one of their old mountain fortresses and now their trained killers are once again hounding those who would act against their interests...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88003_ASSASSIN;Praised be Allah! The Assassins will never be broken! We have suffered in the shadows for many years, but now, a new era begins. We rebuilt our strength and recaptured the mountain fortresses of old. Our enemies will sleep with one eye open from now on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88004;The Hashshashin are no more. As their fortresses and mountain hideouts burn, the last members of the once feared Assassin Order are hunted like animals and cut down without mercy or compassion when found. Their legacy now survives only in the legends and stories spawned from their exploits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88004_ASSASSIN;This is a dark day, indeed. Our righteous order has suffered an enormous setback. All of our mountain fortresses and hideouts have been found and burnt to the ground. The few members who survived the infidels' onslaught are hiding amongst enemies, always in danger. While an era has ended and even though our former glory might never be restored, we shall never give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88007;The word is spreading like wildfire across the lands of the East! Members of the Hashshashin have killed the great warlord [From.GetTitledName]. They stabbed him at his camp in full view of his men, and though the assassins outlived the [From.GetTitle] by only a few seconds, their mission was accomplished. His men swear vengeance against the Assassin Order!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88009;Not even the dreaded Hashshashin have been able to give pause to the Mongols in their bid to conquer the world. Several of their members have been killed in a failed attempt on the life of [From.GetTitledName]. He and his men now swear revenge against the hated Order of Assassins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88010;You wake suddenly in cold sweat with a strong sensation that something is amiss. The flickering candlelight in your tent reveals a plate of hot biscuits and a note pinned by a poisoned dagger next to your bed. It reads: "Mend your decadent ways before it is too late, [Root.GetFirstName]. The Hashshashin are watching.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88011;Master, terrible news! Your faithful servant, [From.GetTitledName], has been found dead in [From.GetHerHis] home, no doubt at the hands of the vile Hashshashin. Carved by knife into [From.GetHerHis] chest were the words: "[Root.GetFirstName] - You were warned.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88012;As you turn a street corner in [Root.Location.GetName], a strange whistling sound swishes past your ear. Your bodyguards topple over, knives in their throats, and before you can react you are surrounded by robed Hashshashin. Their leader approaches you with a sad look on his face. "May you find what you seek in the life hereafter, friend.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88016;[assassin_target.GetTitledName] staggers past your guards, bleeding profusely from a dozen stab-wounds. As [assassin_target.GetSheHe] collapses in a pool of blood at your feet, [assassin_target.GetSheHe] gasps with [assassin_target.GetHerHis] last breath: "The H-Hashshashin...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88017;Your guards bring in a covered basket left just outside your palace. Believing it to be confections from one of your subjects, you hungrily pull away the covering blanket only to reveal the severed, gaping head of [assassin_target.GetTitledName]. The mark of the Hashshashin has been carved into the forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88018;As you stroll through your palace garden with [assassin_target.GetTitledFirstName], you see the brief glint of reflected sunlight on metal as a thrown dagger flashes past and buries itself in your friend's throat. Your bodyguards rush you to safety, but you glimpse a robed assassin scurrying over the palace walls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88019;You wake suddenly in cold sweat with a strong sensation that something is amiss. The flickering candlelight in your tent reveals a plate of hot biscuits and a note pinned by a poisoned dagger next to your bed. It reads: "There are a thousand ways to kill a [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.GetFirstName]. The Hashshashin know them all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA88000;These hashish smokers are harmless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88001;Perhaps these Hashshashin should be taken seriously...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88002;Their demise was inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88002_ASSASSIN;This setback will not be the end of The Assassins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88003;Surely they wouldn't dare strike at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88004;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88007;By the Prophet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88009;By the Prophet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88010;Perhaps the time for change has come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88011;How dare they?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88012;But... but I am not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88016;Oh my.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88017;I think I've lost my appetite...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88018;The Hashshashin! Was I the intended target?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88019;Guards! Search the area!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

88017.cannibal;A shame about [From.GetBestName], but at least I have a snack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
