evt_DESC_JD_60202;I have heard more news about [rebel_general.GetTitledFirstName]. It seems he and his men are moving with haste towards [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The rumors say that they have set their eyes on my lands to be the starting point of their new Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_60207;The word from the traders is that [rebel_general.GetTitledFirstName] was set upon by the armies of the [offmap_china.GetFullName]. The rebel troops never stood a chance against the well supplied and loyal troops of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_60212;With the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been thrown into disarray. Many call for me to continue in the [FromFrom.Culture.GetName] ways as my [FromFrom.GetRootRelation] had intended but I am not so sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_60301;[offmap_china.Ruler.GetMediumChineseEmperorName] has closed off the Empire and stopped all trade along the Silk Road. This is not acceptable. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHeCap] not only harms trade for [offmap_china.GetShortName] but also for my own lands. We must make the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] open up their borders one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_60306;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nThe heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], has decreed that the Empire focus its efforts on the [offmap_china.GetRandomChineseFocus].\nHence we do not have time to negotiate allowing your traders to return. I am sure you can understand why and respect this decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_60307;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nThe heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], demands that, in exchange for opening up the Silk Road, you [GetChineseForceOpenDemand].\nI am sure you can see how this will benefit both our nations and trust you to make the correct decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTA_JD_60202;They shall get no easy fight here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60207;So much for the threats of [rebel_general.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60208;Only one can claim to be the Lord of Ten Thousand Years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60209;They were no match for the [offmap_china.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60211;And now we bow to a dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60212;I will take up the [FromFrom.Culture.GetName] traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60301;War is the only way this shall be resolved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60302;The Silk Road is open... but at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60303;It seems even a dormant dragon is a dangerous one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60304;And now commerce and trade return to the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60308;I am a wonderful negotiator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60400;The Middle Kingdom shall belong to House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_60403;Maybe the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] sent Assassins in secret?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTB_JD_60211;And now they bow to a dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_60212;No. The time of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] ended with my [FromFrom.GetRootRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_60301;The Silk Road is already ours, we just need to 'convince' the traders of that fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_60308;I am impressed this ended without bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_60400;Will [FromFrom.GetSheHe] be able to successfully tame the dragon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_60403;Not only have I lost [invasion_of_china_claimant.GetFirstName], but also this war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTC_JD_60301;We must proceed carefully - let us negotiate first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTD_JD_60301;On second thought, this might not be the best idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPT_JD_60401;And so rises a new dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPT_JD_60402;And so the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetOnlyDynastyName] dragon remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_10101;[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10102_A;In an endeavor to turn us into a tributary state of the [From.Offmap.GetFullName], the [From.GetTitledName] is declaring war on us! Their army is marching towards our realm and the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] fear that we may be facing a long and bloody struggle if we are to avoid bending our knees to the [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetMediumChineseEmperorName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10102_B;Intending to enforce their subjugation as a tributary state of the [From.Offmap.GetFullName], the [From.GetTitledName] has declared war upon [chinese_invasion_target.GetFullName]! [From.Offmap.Ruler.Culture.GetName] armies are already marching towards the realm of [chinese_invasion_target.GetTitledFirstName], and it seems possible that this spells the end of [chinese_invasion_target.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10104_A;[From.GetTitledName] has decreed that the fury of heaven shall reign down upon us! The Chinese armies have begun their march for our lands, and rumors of their military might are already spreading throughout our own regiments. We are soon to face the full wrath of the [From.Offmap.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10104_B;[From.GetTitledName] has decreed that the fury of heaven shall reign down upon [chinese_invasion_target.GetTitledName]! The Chinese armies have begun their march, and the [chinese_invasion_target.GetTitle], if not hiding out in [chinese_invasion_target.Capital.GetName], can only hope to stand tall, as [chinese_invasion_target.GetHerHis] borders are attacked with the full wrath of the [From.Offmap.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10105_A;Rumors of the military might of the [offmap_china.GetFullName] is proving to be a forceful diplomatic tool in itself – after what seems like brief negotiations, [chinese_invasion_target.GetBestName] has peacefully agreed to become a tributary state of the Middle Kingdom. Their couriers whisper that they can only hope that the relationship between the [chinese_invasion_target.GetTitle] and the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmpressEmperorCap] be a fruitful one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10105_B;Not even an independent realm like that of [chinese_invasion_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName] dares stand against the full force of the [offmap_china.GetFullName]. [chinese_invasion_target.GetBestName] has instead peacefully agreed to become a tributary state of the Middle Kingdom. Time will tell whether the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmpressEmperorCap] truly favors them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10108_DISPLACED_PRINCE;The recent turmoil in the Middle Kingdom has left the old House of [PrevRuler.GetOnlyDynastyName] in chaos – removed from the line of succession, Prince [displaced_prince.GetFirstName] now seeks a new future, west of the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName]. Rumors say that raiding and looting follow in [displaced_prince.GetHerHis] footsteps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10108_JURCHEN;Recent events in the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] have caused various rebel factions to rise up in and around the Middle Kingdom. One of them is led by [jurchen_invader.GetFirstName], in charge of a [jurchen_invader.Culture.GetName] tribe, descending upon the West from the mountains. Wherever [jurchen_invader.GetSheHe] goes, the countryside is left ablaze. Throughout the region, people are praying for someone to deal with the hostile raiders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10108_REBEL_GENERAL;After the recent civil war in the Middle Kingdom was crushed by the forces of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress], one of the rebels that opposed [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHim], [rebel_general.GetTitledFirstName], has fled westwards with his forces. He claims that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty is not fit to rule and that he is the true Son of Heaven and shall establish his own Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10130_A;[From.GetTitledName] has sent an emissary to us, suggesting that it is time to allow the [From.Offmap.GetFullName] to become our official sovereign. As the Chinese bureaucrat idly twirls his mustache, his translator clarifies: 'It is only the natural progression of our current relationship, my [Root.GetLordLady]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60208_A;Word has reached you from the east that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetShortChineseEmperorName] has ordered [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName] to mobilize [offmap_china.Governor.GetHerHis] forces and to launch an invasion of our lands to try and force their false [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] onto us. There can only be one dragon and we shall show the [offmap_china.GetShortName] pretender that it is [chinese_invasion_target.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60208_B;Word has reached you from the east that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetShortChineseEmperorName] has ordered [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName] to mobilize [offmap_china.Governor.GetHerHis] forces and to launch an invasion of [chinese_invasion_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to dismantle the upstart pretender. There can only be one dragon and [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], is moving to show, by force, that it is [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60209_A;After the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has fallen into ruin, with no heir ready to take on the mantle of the Son of Heaven and Lord of Ten Thousand Years the Empire has collapsed. The vassals relieved as they are now free from the grasps of the [From.GetEmperorEmpress].\nFurther in the east it is reported that [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], is very pleased with this development as they are once again the only dragon to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60209_B;After the defeat of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], at the hands of [From.GetTitledFirstName], [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been dismantled. The vassals relieved as they are now free from the grasps of the [FromFrom.GetTitle].\nFurther in the east it is reported that [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], is very pleased with this as outcome as once again [offmap_china.GetShortName] has displayed the might of the dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60211;[offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], is no longer the only dragon to rule. General [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] [From.GetBirthName] has completed [From.GetHerHis] conquest and has crowned [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetTitledName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] claims to be the true Son of Heaven and Lord of Ten Thousand Years.\nTalk among the traders from the east say that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetShortChineseEmperorName] is most angered by this pretender. The future of this new [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] remains in question but nobody can argue with results of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s invasion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60400_A;[offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], has sat on [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] throne and looked down upon us for too long! The [offmap_china.Ruler.GetOnlyDynastyName] Dynasty is not fit to rule so we must tame the dragon!\nI have ordered a large portion of our forces East to attack the mainland of [offmap_china.GetShortName] and in retaliation the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has commanded [From.GetTitledFirstName] to launch a counter attack into the lands of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThousands upon thousands of troops loyal to the Son of Heaven march towards us.\nThe time of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetOnlyDynastyName] Dynasty is coming to an end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60400_B;Tired of how [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], sits on [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] throne and looks down upon the world, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has taken it upon [FromFrom.GetHerselfHimself] to tame the dragon!\n[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has mustered a portion of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] forces and sent them East to invade the [offmap_china.GetShortName] heartland with the intention of claiming it for [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]!\nMeanwhile the rest of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] troops remain to fight off the inevitable counterattack from [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60401;The forces of [From.GetBestName] have prevailed! With the troops of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] shattered and the conflicts in the Middle Kingdom finally over, the former [offmap_china.PrevRuler.GetEmperorEmpress], [offmap_china.PrevRuler.GetOnlyDynastyName] [offmap_china.PrevRuler.GetBirthName], has been dethroned and in [offmap_china.PrevRuler.GetHerHis] place [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], now rules!\nHouse [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has successfully invaded the Eastern lands and now they reign supreme.\nGlory to the new [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60402;The forces of [From.GetBestName] have been defeated! All across the [offmap_china.GetShortName] heartland they have been crushed in their many skirmishes with the troops of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress].\nNow the forces in the West, led by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], have prevailed in their battles as well putting an end to this foolish invasion and dismantling [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60403;Whispers in the East claim that [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName] is in a joyous mood as the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] claimant, [invasion_of_china_claimant.GetBestName], has died.\n[invasion_of_china_claimant.GetHerHisCap] death has shattered the morale of the [From.Culture.GetName] forces who now retreat back to their homes in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nJust like [invasion_of_china_claimant.GetBestName] this invasion of [offmap_china.GetShortName] has come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_10102_A_brave;This is our chance to prove ourselves. Let them come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10102_A_craven;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], have mercy upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10102_A_neutral;This could get ugly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10102_A_pious;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] see us through this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10102_B_other_religion;May their gods protect them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_10104_B_pious;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] see them through this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10105;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10105_TT;§Y[chinese_invasion_target.GetTitledName]§! became a tributary of §Ythe [offmap_china.GetFullName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10108;How unsettling...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10130;We would be humbled to serve the great [From.Offmap.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10130_B;We were misguided in raiding you - instead we shall serve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_JD_10130;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will not kneel without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10130_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledName]§! will declare war on you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
