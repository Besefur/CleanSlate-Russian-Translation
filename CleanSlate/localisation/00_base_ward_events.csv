EVTDESC78000;A ward of mine complained and called my court inferior, at least in comparison to the child's father's court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78005;To be a ward in [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName]'s court is improving my stature. I had no idea how different a [Root.Father.GetTitle]'s court and a [Root.Guardian.GetTitle]'s court could be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78006;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] told me how much [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed being in the court of [From.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] and how [From.GetHerHis] stature had improved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78010;My child was lured into stealing cookies and smearing jam all over the kitchen by one of my wards! The cook gave them a hearty scolding and then sent them to me, both still smeared with jam and covered in cookie crumbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78015;I have seen the looks on my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s face every time she looks at my ward. The longing on her face tells me she wants to have children of her own, and I'll gladly help her with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78020;My ward [bullied_ward.GetTitledFirstName] came running for me, tears streaming down [bullied_ward.GetHerHis] face and snot creeping towards [bullied_ward.GetHerHis] mouth.\n"[Root.GetFirstName], please help me! The other children are not nice to me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78025;A foreign court can teach a child all kinds of important lessons, everything from respecting to understanding and even adapting to other people's traditions and culture. My ward has learnt several important lessons of life in my court, as foreign as it may be from its father's court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78026;I knew I had made a good decision when I sent my child to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. The life lessons learnt from a foreign court is worth its weight in gold and my child have learnt to respect and understand other people's traditions and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78030;No matter how many questions I ask, [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] always has an answer and is ever so patient with me! Our relationship has grown and I feel as if I have formed a strong mentor-relationship with [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC78031;My ward [From.GetFirstName] is inquisitive and asks so many questions it is hard to answer them all. I try my best and for every answer I give, [From.GetFirstName] seems to like me even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA78000;Try to improve your court to impress the child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78005;What else can I learn?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78006;I'm proud of you, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78010;Punish the fosterling, forgive my child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78015;Shall we try some more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78020;Why should I care?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78025;Its father will be pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78026;Good, good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78030;This will be good to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA78031;I think we have become friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB78000;For a simple [Root.GetTitle], my court is nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB78010;You will both clean the stables for a whole week!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB78020;You will grow strong from that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB78030;I can handle things on my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC78000;Have the child sweep the stables;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC78010;I forgive you, but promise me this won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC78020;I'll punish [child_bully.GetFirstName], don't you worry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD78000;Birch the child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD78010;Punish my own child for being so impressionable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
