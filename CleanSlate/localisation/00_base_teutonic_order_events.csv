EVTNAME8703;The Teutonic Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC8700;Several Kingdoms in Europe are fighting to keep the pagans back and try to spread Christianity eastwards. The Teutonic Order should assist them by offering to settle on their borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8701;To the Great [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYour wisdom and mercy are legendary. The Teutonic Order wishes to assist you in your valiant struggle against the pagans. By transfering a border County to the order, we will be able to establish a local presence and fight these heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8702;[From.GetTitledName] has graciously seceded the [Root.County.GetFullName] to us. The Teutonic Order will now be able to effectively fight the heathens in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8703;In an effort to defend [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName] against pagan attacks, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has granted the Teutonic Order the [From.County.GetFullName]. This county has never been fully settled and many of the population are still heathens. This noble gesture could help protect the endangered frontier of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName] as well as further the Holy War against pagans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8720;The Teutonic Order wishes to expand into the Baltics in order to better fight the heathens. To show my support, perhaps I should offer them a county of mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8721;My liege,\nI wish to support The Teutonic Order by grating them a county, and seek your approval.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8722;My liege,\nMy vassal, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] wishes to support The Teutonic Order by grating them a county. I would of course not allow such an important decision without first seeking your approval.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8723;Your generous offer of grating a county to The Teutonic Order has met with my approval.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8724;I will not permit that you cede any territory to The Teutonic Order!\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8725;To the Great [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYour bravery is legendary. I wish to support you in your valiant struggle against the heathens, and hereby offer to transfer a County to the order.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8800;Holy Order or not, I will not let any foreign power establish a hold in my realm.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA8700;I will send an offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8720;Their precense is most welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8721;I better leave this decision to my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8722;Excelent proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8723;Then so it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8724;Then I will retract my offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
