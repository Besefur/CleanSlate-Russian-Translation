EVTDESC_WOL_2002;Life in the shadows is a risky affair - eavesdroppers can be discovered, plots can backfire, and vengeful victims come after you dagger in hand! I am not proud of what I do, but it is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_2101;Several vicious rumors have been circulating about me lately. With a lot of effort, I have finally managed to trace them back to [From.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2110;One of my informants, a young soldier with more vices than he can afford, has managed to gain the trust of [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and now often stands guard outside [target_spy_on.GetPossPronoun] door. I don't understand how the fellow managed it, but who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? For enough gold, he might be persuaded to get rid of [target_spy_on.GetFirstName]... violently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2111_DEATH;I try to sit up in bed, but someone is holding me down! It's the burly armsman with the trustworthy face I promoted to the guard last week. Another assailant is trying to force a rag into my mouth. Holding my nose too... can't breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2111_LIVES;I try to sit up in bed, but someone is holding me down! It's the burly armsman with the trustworthy face I promoted to the guard last week.

I punch the other one in the nose and rush from the room!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I punch the other one in the nose and rush from the room, trailing blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2112;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern.

EVTDESC_WOL_2113;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, managed to slay the [GetRootFromInsult] in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed. Unfortunately, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2114;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern. Shamefacedly, he recounts how they stabbed [From.GetTitledFirstName] in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed, and how [From.GetSubjectPronoun] somehow managed to get away. I pat him on the shoulder and tell him it's alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2115;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, only managed to wound the [GetRootFromInsult]. Worse, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2116;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern.

I pat him on the shoulder and tell him it's alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2117;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, completely botched the attack on the [GetRootFromInsult]. Worse, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2120;I have learned from my little birds that [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] plans to travel the realm incognito for a lark, mingling with the common folk. [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] will only be protected by two loyal friends during this little adventure - a great opportunity to have [target_spy_on.GetObjectPronoun] abducted, if I so wished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2121;On a lark, I decided to travel among the common folk incognito with but a friend, a servant and a bodyguard. As we ride through a forest, an arrow suddenly sprouts from the neck of my trusty guard! Shouting a warning, I ride like crazy to get away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2122;My hired thugs managed to waylay [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and brought [From.GetObjectPronoun] to me in a sack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2123;The thugs I hired failed to capture [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], though apparently they slew a guard and a servant in the attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2200;I have decided to free [From.GetTitledName] from the dungeons of [From.Host.GetTitledName]. It will take time - and likely some gold - but [From.GetFirstName] deserves a better fate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2201;I have decided to liberate my beloved [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] from the filthy paws of her abductor, [From.Employer.GetTitledName]. It will take time - and likely some gold - but [From.GetFirstName] deserves a better fate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2211;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] has tragically died in captivity before I had a chance to break [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun] out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2212;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] has tragically fallen comatose, making my endeavour to free [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun] rather pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2213;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer a prisoner, so I can abort my plans to free [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2221;I've approached [target_agent.GetBestName] at the court of [target_agent.Employer.GetTitledName] with my plan to liberate [target_captive.GetTitledFirstName]. [target_agent.GetFirstName] is sympathetic and might be persuaded to take the risk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2223;I woke from my troubled sleep with a start. Was that a thud outside my cell? Keys rattle in the lock and the door opens to a thin beam of light. It's [target_agent.GetBestName]! 'Come with me quickly [Root.GetLordLady]! [target_agent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has hired me to help you escape!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2224;I received some bad news this morning. My prisoner, [target_captive.GetBestName] escaped from [target_captive.GetPossPronoun] cell in the night. [target_captive.GetSubjectPronounCap] had outside help - one of the guards might never wake from the blow to his head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2224_CONSORT;My concubine [target_captive.GetBestName] has fled! She climbed out of her tower room window, probably with outside assistance, because my guards were completely unable to locate her before she escaped my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2224_CONSORT_MALE;My consort [target_captive.GetBestName] has fled! He climbed out of his tower room window, probably with outside assistance, because my guards were completely unable to locate him before he escaped my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2225;Good news! [target_captive.GetBestName] was successfully sprung from captivity by the daring [target_agent.GetBestName] and is safely back in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2226;I woke from my troubled sleep with a start. Was that a thud outside my cell? Keys rattle in the lock and the door opens to a bright light. It's that ogre of a gaoler. 'This blighter attempted your rescue', he growls, and holds up a comatose [target_agent.GetManWoman] like a ragdoll. '[Root.Host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] won't be too pleased, now will [Root.Host.GetSubjectPronoun]!?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2227;The prison guards foiled an escape attempt last night. My treacherous [GetFromFromRelation] [target_agent.GetBestName] was captured trying to free [target_captive.GetTitledName] from [target_captive.GetPossPronoun] cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2227_CONSORT;My [GetFromRelation] [target_captive.GetFirstName] was almost abducted last night. The treacherous [target_agent.GetBestName] attempted to 'rescue' her by climbing in through the window, but slipped and fell! When questioned, the concussed [target_agent.GetFirstName] admitted that [target_rescuer.GetTitledName] was behind this chivalrous idiocy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2228;The [GetRootFromInsult] [target_captive.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] had me thrown me in the oubliette to make sure I don't escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2229;Bad news... [target_agent.GetBestName] failed to free [target_captive.GetBestName] from [target_captive.GetPossPronoun] captivity and was imprisoned [target_agent.GetReflexivePronoun]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2230;My agent in [target_captive.Host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court, [target_agent.GetBestName], is no longer able to carry out the mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2231;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], I fear that the plan I have devised to liberate [target_captive.GetBestName] will cost more money than I had estimated. If you still wish see [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun] free, please send me the necessary funds.\n\nYour friend, [target_agent.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2232;Despite my best efforts, I still have not managed to find anyone at the court of [target_captive.Host.GetTitledFirstName] who would be willing to help [target_captive.GetBestName] escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2300;I watched from the shadows as my spymaster, [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], surreptitiously marked a spot on the wall with a piece of chalk. This might just be [Root.job_spymaster.GetPossPronoun] normal skulduggery, but my intuition says not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2302;Eavesdropping from a secret passage in the walls, I overheard my faithless spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] talking to another conspirator. They are plotting to [target_plotter.GetPlot]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2303;My snooping [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], apparently overheard me plotting murder and did not take kindly to my plans. I have been arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2304;Over the last week, I have observed my spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] carefully and found nothing further to arouse my suspicion. Perhaps I'll just have to accept that odd behaviour goes with the job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2305;I have noticed my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] clumsily spying on me lately. It probably has something to do with [From.GetPossPronoun] unhealthy obsession with intrigue and an overly suspicious mind. I should be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_WOL_2111_DEATH;I don't want to die like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WOL_2111_DEATH_KNOWN;[target_snooper.GetTitledName] sends [target_snooper.GetPossPronoun] regards!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WOL_2111_KNOWN;Under torture, the two men admitted that [target_snooper.GetTitledName] hired them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WOL_2111_UNKNOWN;Unfortunately, the two assailants got away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WOL_2121;...and manage to outdistance the bandits! Amateurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WOL_2121_CAUGHT;...but we are surrounded! No bandits, but the agents of [target_snooper.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2003;I shall rule from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2050;I wonder what secrets [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronoun] is hiding?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2061;Time to turn my attention elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2065;Yes, this is pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2071;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2083;Muahaha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2084;The things I do for stability in the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2085;A wasted opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2086;I have no choice but to agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2088;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] will live to regret this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_1;I have it! [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] likes to dress up as a [target_spy_on.GetManWomanOpp]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_2;How about a classic? [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] takes little boys to bed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_3;Midgets, shoes... No! [target_spy_on.GetFirstName] is having an affair with a feisty goat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_4;[target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] likes to bathe in the blood of virgins. Brilliant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_5;[target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] murdered a childhood friend at the tender age of 11!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_6;[target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] has an imaginary friend called Bappo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_7;[target_spy_on.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap]! Yes, [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronoun] is surely a willing slave to dark forces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_8;[target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] leads a secret life as a prostitute in a brothel in [target_spy_on.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2110;Yes, that would be expedient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2112;Outside, I order my guards to tie up the loose ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2113;It was worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2115;I hope [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronoun] dies from infection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2117;Incompetent bungler! I should have done it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2120;Ah yes. It would suit my purposes marvellously!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2123;Morons! You can't find good help these days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2200;I'll probably need an agent in [target_captive.Host.Capital.Capital.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2211;Well, it was worth a shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2221;Put the plan in motion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2223;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2224;[target_rescuer.GetTitledName] was surely behind this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2226;Poor [target_agent.GetManWoman]... was that [target_agent.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2227;The dungeon is not secure enough. Throw [target_captive.GetFirstName] in the oubliette!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2228;I will die here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2229;Damnation! Security will be too tight now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2230;I will have to look for another contact...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2231;I guess I have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2300;Time to spy on the spy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_WOL_2080_TOOLTIP;§Y[target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]§! will either join your factions or be exposed, giving you the right to imprison [target_spy_on.GetHerHim].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_WOL_2221;I've changed my mind. Abort the whole scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_WOL_2080;Keep this information to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_WOL_2080_TOOLTIP;Do not use the information, but keep spying on §Y[target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_WOL_2082_TOOLTIP;Do not use the information against §Y[target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF_WOL_2080;I see, but I think it is time to spy on someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_WOL_2080_TOOLTIP;Do not use the information and stop spying on §Y[target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_WOL_2101;§Y[This.GetTitledFirstName]§! finds out that I started the rumors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_WOL_2111;§Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! is attacked and hopefully slain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_WOL_2121;Some thugs are hired, with orders to bring me §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
