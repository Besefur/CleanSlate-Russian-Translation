EVTDESC_MNM_9004;My [rumor_councillor.GetJobTitle], [rumor_councillor.GetTitledFirstName], has brought me the most extraordinary news! Apparently [rumor_councillor.GetSheHe] has uncovered a rumor concerning an exceedingly special artifact. The specifics of [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName]'s information are uncertain, but [rumor_councillor.GetSheHe] is convinced that there is a degree of truth to the tales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9005;After the council meeting, [rumor_councillor.GetJobTitle] [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName] asked me to exchange a few words in private. Apparently [rumor_councillor.GetSheHe] has uncovered a rumor concerning a rare artifact. [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName] believed there was some truth to the rumor and urged me to have a search arranged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9006;During this evening's council meeting, [rumor_councillor.GetJobTitle] [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName] told us of a rumor [rumor_councillor.GetSheHe] had encountered. The peasants speak of an artifact hidden not far away from here. The specifics of [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName]'s information are uncertain, but perhaps this would be worth investigating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9009_A;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] came to me with some regrettable news. It seems like the too much has passed since we first uncovered the rumor of the artifact and now the trail has gone cold. There is no hope of finding the lost treasure and the search has been canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9009_B;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] can no longer fulfill [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] duty to search for the rumored artifact. I can select another councilor to replace [relic_hunter.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9020;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] approached me after the council meeting to request some more diplomats to aid [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] in obtaining more information concerning the rumored artifact. While I could divert some of my envoys to this task for a time, our regular diplomatic efforts would suffer due to the neglect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9021;The hunt for the rumored artifact has begun to slow down, [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] just informed me. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has some valuable and promising leads, but to investigate them the search must venture into distant, inhospitable lands. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] claims [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] needs more soldiers to attempt such a venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9022;My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has sought me out with [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] concerns regarding the search for the relic. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has asked me to issue a decree allowing [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] treasure hunters to appropriate the resources and men they need from the local burghers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9023;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has uncovered several clues indicating that [spy_target.GetTitledFirstName] of [spy_title.GetName] possesses important information regarding the rumored artifact. However, [spy_target.GetSheHe] is unwilling to talk and [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] wants more spies transferring from their regular missions to target the [spy_target.GetTitle] instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9024;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has spent many weeks bent over ancient tomes and scrolls in search of more information regarding the rumored artifact. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] claims to be on the right path but apparently the progress is slow. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has asked of me to order the best scholars in [primary_title.GetName] to aid [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9025;Despite the monthly sum of gold I have set aside for the artifact investigation, [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] claims that [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] lacks the sufficient funds. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has asked me to put an additional sum to [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] disposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9026;One of my spies has brought me some disturbing news. Apparently [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has been putting the extra funds I gave [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] own pocket!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9027;For some time now, I have been worried about [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName]'s progress, or rather, the lack thereof. Now my worst fears have been confirmed. As a consequence of [relic_hunter.GetFirstName]'s carelessness, an accident has occurred and a large amount of the resources and documentation was ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9028;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has shared an intriguing discovery with me. During [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] search for the artifact, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] has come across the rumors of an even rarer object! If we decide to pursue this new lead instead we can still make use of some of the old research and resources, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] tells me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9029;[Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] must have cast a curse on me and my venture to recover the lost artifact, for I was just brought the most dreadful news! [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] died in an unexplainable accident while searching for the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9030;[Root.relic_score.GetValue];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9031_A;I have received word from [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] that [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] is making steady progress in the search for the artifact. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] believes [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] is closing on the end of the trail, and that [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] will soon be able to present the ancient relic to me in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9031_B;I have received word from [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] that [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] is making steady progress in the search for the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9032;I have received the regrettable news that [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has experienced a setback in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] search for the artifact, by spending a considerable amount of time following a wrong lead. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] assures me [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] will redouble [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9200;Having received the news of [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName]'s return you hurry to the throne room. As you receive [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] presents you with a small box containing an unusually large tooth. It is with great reverence in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] voice that [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] announces: 'This is the sacred tooth of Buddha. It is the same relic that was once left in the custody of Khema, smuggled out of Kalinga by princess Hemamali and which has since been cared for by the finest kings in all of India'. To be the custodian of this relic is to exhibit the greatest of kingly virtues, it marks the divine right of the holder to rule over men. Your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] has brought you a greater prize than you dared imagine.\n\nAs you look up from the tooth itself you realize this is something that has not escaped [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] [relic_hunter.GetHerselfHimself]. A steady gaze meets yours, this is clearly the look of a [relic_hunter.GetManWoman] that expects a great reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9201;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] and [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] expedition has returned from their search and now stand before you. In an opened box lies the largest diamond you have ever seen. 'It is known as the Mountain of Light' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] tells you, 'and it is a stone that has brought wealth, prestige and splendor to those that have owned it for centuries.'\n\nSurely with this stone in your hands you will be the envy of every ruler alive. In truth it is as magnificent as it is terrifying, you cannot help but recall the saying that all large gemstones are cursed...\n\nLooking up you realize [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] is and [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] companions are still here, awaiting a reward for the kingly prize they have brought you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9202;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, presenting you with a carefully wrapped Danda. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] claims that this scepter is of great age and that it has belonged to a number of ancient monarchs before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9203;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] search and brings with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small crystal-like bead. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] insist that this what remained after the cremation of a great spiritual master and that it is an object of great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9204;My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] has returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest and brings with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a carefully packaged bone that [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] insists once belonged to the great Buddha himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9600;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a most remarkable, exquisite horn. It produces a tone unmatched in volume, instilling courage in the hearts of all who hear it. Could this be the Gjallarhorn of myth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9601;Still dressed in traveler's garb, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] enters your throne room and kneels before you. Looking rather pale and a bit sickly, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] produces a small object, placing it gingerly in the palm of your outstretched hand.\n\n'Andvari's Gift... The Andvaranaut, my liege...' [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] whispers reverently. 'It must be. Its power is undeniable, it has already brought me many riches on the road back to the court.' You nod solemnly in response. Though it feels light in your hand, you already feel the burden on your soul. This ring must have enormous power, but you remember hearing in legends the curse that lies upon it...\n\nRegardless, with this find [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has truly surpassed [relic_hunter.GetHerselfHimself]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9602;Proudly, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] strides into your throne room. With a flourish of [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] cloak [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] produces a heavy hammer from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] belt, placing it head-first at [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] feet. Kneeling before it, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] solemnly proclaims: 'I have recovered the hammer of Thor, the Thundergod, himself!'\n\nAs you reach down for it you notice that it looks strange – unlike any craftsmanship you have encountered in your realm thus far. The haft is obviously shorter than it was intended to be, and as your fingers touch it is not hard to convince yourself of the surge of power coursing through your body. Surely this means you were meant to wield it!\n\nLooking up, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] still waits for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9603;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] long travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes up to you and pulls out a small, carefully-wrapped package from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] clothes. With an awe-struck gaze [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] removes the cloth wrapping and reveals a piece of strangely-formed bark.\n\n'I have found the spirits of our ancestors...' [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] whispers reverently, handing it to you. Turning it the right way up, you immediately understand what [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] means. The bark has clearly taken the shape of not just one, but three distinct visages, each staring ominously into your soul. You can sense the connection with your forebears... And the power they no doubt offer you over others.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has truly proven [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] worth today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9604;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] gently places a large box on the floor before you. As [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] men proceed to break it open, a single gold coin rolls falls to the floor through one of the box's widening cracks. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] picks it up and hands it to you, smiling brightly. 'I have found you the Mill of Fortune!'\n\nIn the opened box you see a very well-made quern, and your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] continues [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] explanation. 'This is not the first time we have found coins near the Sampo on our way back here. Flour and salt, too... It seems one's fortunes increase just by being near it.'\n\nRolling the coin on your knuckles you ponder the importance of this find. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] may have found you the means to create wealth from nothingness itself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9605;The gathering of thick thunderclouds overhead accompanies [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName]'s' return to your court, and, drenched, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] kneels before you in your throne room, holding up a large axe for you in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] hands. 'The axe, my [Root.GetLordLady], of Perun Himself...'\n\nAs you rise and step towards [relic_hunter.GetHerHim], you see the axe's fine quality, and the bolts of lightning clearly visible on the sides of the axe-head. You reach for it, and just as you grab hold and lift it from your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s hands a thunderclap can be heard in the distance. Surely this is a good omen!\n\nHolding the imposing axe as if you were born to it, you look down at the awe-struck [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] who brought it to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9606;A proud [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] enters your throne room, a huge weapon on [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] shoulder. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] bows, and when [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] holds out the weapon you see it is a huge two-handed axe, the head of which is crafted out of stone... 'My search has been long and difficult,' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says, 'but what I bring you can be no other than the axe wielded by Perkunas himself!'\n\nYou take the axe and inspect it. It does indeed bear a striking resemblance to the description you've heard of it, from legend. It feels heavy and powerful in your hands, and though it might not be the perfect weapon in combat you definitely exude an air of authority around you while you wield it...\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle], at least, seems impressed, as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] waits for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9607;Paired with a brief, but heavy downpour, a drenched [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] lengthy travels. Once in your presence, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] produces a small box, and opens it to reveal a beautiful, strange stone. With a broad smile [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] hands it to you. 'This... This stone is the Rain Stone... The Yada Tashy. It must be! Rain has followed our every step...'\n\nYou hold the stone in your hand, and ponder the earlier downpour's sudden onset. It makes sense! And with this stone, your lands' crops are all but assured to grow well. Other than the obvious benefit in food production, this should also make you more popular among your subjects.\n\nThe [relic_hunter.GetManWoman] who made it possible smiles at your elation, waiting patiently...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9804;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find a powerful artifact. Holding a small metal box, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] appears before you and, bowing, offers it to you. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I have searched far and wide, and have found you the bones of Saint Peter, himself!'\n\nOpening the box to sate your curiosity, you indeed find the aged bones and skull of a man, packed in the small space of the container. Properly protected from the elements, it is likely that they will continue to survive for a long time to come. And so long that they do, they will be sure to improve the Christian world's disposition towards you.\n\nSeemingly expecting for you to speak, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9805;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an intriguing piece of clothing. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] gives me a seamless, finely-woven tunic, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] claims is none other than the one Jesus wore before his crucifixion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9806;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small, ornate metal box. Within it lies a old woven crown of a particularly prickly plant... Surely this must be the Crown of Thorns Jesus himself wore on the cross!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9807;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box, within which lies a single, large, old-looking nail. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this is an ancient fragment of the True Cross! This will surely improve my standing in the Christian world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9808;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned carrying a small box. Inside it I find a small piece of preserved skin, which my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures is none other but the prepuce of Jesus himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9809;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box containing a single fingerbone. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] ensures me that it belonged to a saint, and that therefore it is most prestigious to possess it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9810;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing a seemingly ordinary shepherd's staff. Holding it delicately, and clearly treating the simple object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'I have found you the staff held by Moses, which split the Red Sea and produced water from naught but rock.'\n\nIndeed, once you hold it is not hard to recognize it for the remarkable object that it is. Created by God Himself on the Sixth Day of Creation, he who holds it is sure to have God's favor!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the staff's potential power creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9811;Followed by one of [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] men, who carefully carries a beautiful harp, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] long search. With a broad smile, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] gives a sign for the man to hand you the instrument.\n\n'What you hold in your hands, my [Root.GetLordLady], is what I have determined to be the actual harp played by King David, himself.' Running your fingers over the strings, the sound is almost divine! To have a talented musician play this instrument would undoubtedly put even the most cantankerous of visitors in a good mood.\n\nYou highly doubt it would work on [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] if you made [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] leave without a reward, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9814;Upon [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] return, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands me a small jewelry box within which lies a small, engraved, brass and iron signet ring. Its seal, I discover, is a Star of David, and my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says that all signs point towards this being the seal of King Solomon, himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9815;The voices that have plagued me recently have begun to recede. Those who are close to me have told me they thought me possessed by a demon of sorts... But no more! What little voices remain seem to disappear whenever I clutch Solomon's ring. Perhaps it truly does hold power over demons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9816;Since I possess the Blessed Mantle, it would certainly be possible to instill a portion of the Mantle's power into drinkable form. This could be done through a ritual involving soaking the garment in an infusion of rose water, and catching the water that is wrung from it in bottles. To do it right, the ritual would have to be quite expensive, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9820;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] artifact hunt, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands you a small ebony box. Within it, you find a crystal-encased, ivory-bordered seal.\n\n'This is the seal used by the Prophet Muhammad', your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says as you inspect the beautiful object. 'It must be, for it matches all depictions we have of the seal used on Muhammad's letters.' Not only will the Muslim world now surely look up to you, but you can henceforth also claim to write with the authority of Muhammad, himself!\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits as you gaze at the seal, clearly expecting a reward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9821;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes before you, proudly carrying a large, inspiring banner. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] does not need to speak for you to recognize it, for it has all the necessary signs allowing you to readily identify it as Muhammad's personal standard.\n\nWith it, you will not only be an inspiration to the men under your command, but also to the Muslim world as a whole. Holding it in your hands, you feel the connection to the Prophet, and you know that your men will fight like lions wherever it is seen.\n\nAs draw your gaze away from it, you see your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is still standing there, waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9822;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] search, followed by two men who carry a heavy, ornate gold box, which they place on the floor before you. Bowing, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] proclaims: 'My search is concluded. I have brought home with me the Blessed Mantle – a gift from the Prophet Muhamad to the poet Zuhayr.'\n\nOpening the box, you find the Mantle wrapped in forty pieces of richly-decorated cloth. The mantle itself is a beautiful buttoned white coat made from goat hair, sure to increase your standing in the Muslim world.\n\nPleased, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] waits for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9823;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a beautiful sword. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it is one of the Prophet Mohammad's nine swords! Not only is it a finely-crafted blade, but it should also make men more eager to follow me in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9824;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box within which lies an ancient piece of parchment – a letter addressed to an ancient foreign ruler. Age has not worn the letter past legibility, and so it is possible to clearly identify the signature of the Prophet Mohammad, himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9825;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small glass reliquary. Inside, one can clearly see a single hair, which my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] claims is a hair from the beard of the Prophet Muhammad, himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9826;Upon [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] return, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands me a richly-decorated flask filled with some kind of liquid. According to my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle], this is a flask of rose water that has been infused with holy power by dipping a single button of the Blessed Mantle into it. It purportedly has miraculous qualities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9830;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find a powerful artifact. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] reaches in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] satchel and produces a beautiful golden cup, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] hands to you.\n\n'This can be no other than the Cup of Jamshid from myth,' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says, 'drink from it and the truth of this world and all seven heavens will be yours!' The significance of this find sinks in as you hold the cup and listen to your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s words... Properly utilized in a ritual of divination, this cup could indeed, if the legends are to be believed, provide you with the answers to many questions.\n\nAfter a short while you realize [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] is still waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9831;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes before you, proudly carrying a large coat made of leopard-skin. Handing the garment to you reverently, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] explains: 'After a long and arduous search, I have recovered the Babr-e Bayan – Rostam's legendary coat!'\n\nDespite Rostam wearing it in many a war, you find no damage whatsoever on the dark-colored garment as you inspect it. This can only be interpreted as proof of its legendary invulnerability! Donning it yourself would certainly make you much less likely to come to harm in personal combat.\n\nAs you ponder this find's implications, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is seemingly waiting for a reward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9832;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an unbelievable find! The Derafsh Kaviani, long thought to have been lost and destroyed when the Muslims invaded the Sasanian Empire, seems to have survived, and has now returned to its rightful Zoroastrian holders! This leather banner, in red, purple and gold, will hang beautifully in my throne room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9833;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a box containing a small sapling of a strange bush. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is convinced that this is a sapling that has sprouted from the divine Haoma bush, and surely, based on its strange looks, it cannot be anything else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9834;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a large, beautiful cypress branch. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] tells me that this is a branch of the mighty cypress tree that Zoroaster himself planted in Keshmar! Perhaps an equally mighty tree will sprout from it, here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9835;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a well-preserved head. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to a [This.GetArtifactSource]! Perhaps it might bestow upon me some of the wisdom it once contained?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9836;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a well-preserved tongue. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to a [This.GetArtifactSource]! Perhaps it might bestow upon me some of the eloquence it once possessed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9837;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a well-preserved tongue. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to an infamous unbeliever! Perhaps it might bestow upon me some of penchant for deceit its owner once possessed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9838;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a well-preserved hand. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to a [This.GetArtifactSource]! Perhaps it might guide my hand when next I find myself in battle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9839;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a well-preserved arm. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to a [This.GetArtifactSource]! Perhaps it might bestow upon me some of the knowledge of statecraft its owner once possessed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
