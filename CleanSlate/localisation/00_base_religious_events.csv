EVTDESC39000;The [Root.Religion.GetName] heresy has reared its ugly head in the county of [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39001;The [Root.Religion.GetName] heresy has spread to [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39010;The charismatic preacher has convinced me. The [Root.Location.Religion.GetName] creed is the true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39020;My faith is strong and I am itching to spread the good word to my friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39021;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], is attempting to convert me to [From.GetPossPronoun] heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39022;My dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] accepted conversion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39023;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] would have me reconsider and embrace the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39024;Betrayal! The guards are coming for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39025;[From.GetFirstName], my [GetFromRelation], remains true to [From.GetPossPronoun] errant beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39026;[From.GetFirstName] has seen sense and abandoned [From.GetPossPronoun] dangerous heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39100;A decree has been issued confirming the formation of a new religious military order - the Knights of St. John. The Knights, who have already protected and cared for sick pilgrims in Jerusalem for some time, now have the full weight of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church behind them. Pious [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers may call on their support in wars against heretics and heathens, but they will not fight those of their own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39101;A new Christian military order has been founded by a small group of wealthy knights. The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon - or the Knights Templar for short - have sworn to protect pilgrims travelling through the Holy Land. The [Root.Religion.GetName] church fully endorses the Order, and this will allow pious [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers to call on their aid, though they will only fight against heretics and infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39102;The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem has been formed, sponsored by the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church and the Holy Roman Emperor. The Teutonic Order, much like the Knights of St. John and the Knights Templar, primarily protect and care for pilgrims to the Holy Land, but will serve any [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler willing to pay for their upkeep. Being a religious order, they will only fight against heretics and infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39200;The coffers of Holy Mother Church are full and the faithful are struggling against infidels and heathens. Perhaps we should provide some assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39201;Your righteous struggle against the heathens has not gone unnoticed. I have dispatched a Papal emissary with sufficient funds to assist you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39210;One of the God's favored children seems to have been accused of kinslaying. This is clearly unfortunate.  The Church will allow him to do penance for absolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39211;An emissary from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has reached us with a proposal. [From.GetTitle] will grant us absolution for our sins of kinslaying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39212;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has repented [From.GetHerHis] grave sin of kinslaying. Absolution has been granted and the all the angels of Heaven are crying with joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39213;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to repent [From.GetHerHis] grave sin of kinslaying. [From.GetSheHeCap] will spend a long time in Purgatory...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39220;I am forced to languish in this dungeon, where the evil fiends of [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is torturing my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39221;We have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName] asking us to intervene on his behalf and ask [From.Host.GetTitledFirstName] to release him from his prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39222;We have caught [From.GetTitledFirstName] attempting to smuggle out a letter to the Pope, where he wishes the Holy Father to intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39223;The prayers of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have not gone unnoticed. Is there such a thing as a limit to my power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39224;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to our intervention and written a stern letter to [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] demanding our release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39225;A secret messenger from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived, telling me that the Holy Father can do nothing to help me..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39226;A letter has arrived from the Holy Father. He demands that we release [From.GetTitledFirstName] from our prison and submit to the will of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39230;A procession of monks have arrived at our castle, protesting that we are keeping a Bishop in our prison. They claim that we are sinning against the law of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39240;There are rumors that one of the rulers of Christendom is employing a heathen in their court. This is not acceptable to the Church, and this earthly lord will surely be damned unless we intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39241;An emissary from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived in our court. According to the emissary, the Holy Father is concerned about our employment of heathens as advisors. The Pope is asking of me to remove them from position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39242;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The emissary says that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to banish a heathen that was in [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39243;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The emissary says that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to imprison a heathen that was in [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39244;This is a day that the has caused cries of joy to rise up from the pits of hell. An emissary from  [From.GetBestName] is stating that [From.GetSheHe] refuse to follow our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39250;An emissary comes from [From.GetBestName], with hopes of buying indulgences to clean [From.GetHerHis] sins. While [From.GetSheHe] has committed some very grave sins, this shows sincere regret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39251;The Holy Father has granted us absolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39252;An emissary comes from [From.GetBestName], with hopes of repenting [From.GetHerHis] sins. While [From.GetSheHe] has committed some very grave sins, this shows sincere regret and I will lift his excommunication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39253;The Holy Father has agreed to lift the excommunication against me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39261;An emissary from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived in our court. According to the emissary, [From.GetSheHe] is concerned about our employment of heathens as advisors. The Patriarch is asking of me to remove them from position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39270;There is an errant bishop in one of the [catholic.GetName] realms. Rumours speak of him pledging allegiance to his earthly master ahead of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39271;The Holy Father is most concerned about the loyalties of the bishops of our realm. [From.GetBestName] is asking for us to replace one of them with a bishop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39272;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The errant bishop is no longer in a position of authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39273;Our emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName]. The news he bring is dire indeed, as [From.GetBestName] is refusing to follow our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39275;We have loyal bishops in other realms. Perhaps we should return them to their de-jure rulers, so that they can guide their earthly lieges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39276;The Holy Father wishes to inform us that we will now also obey an early liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39277;The Holy Father has granted you the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. We will serve you faithfully as a vassal, and guide your rule in a Christian way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39300;A young artist is working on what is clearly a divinely inspired icon, depicting Mary, Mother of God. He needs sponsorship to finish it, so we can place it in our own chapel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39301;A young artist is working on what is clearly a divinely inspired icon, depicting Christ Pantocrator. He needs sponsorship to finish it, so we can place it in our own chapel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39302;A young artist is working on what is clearly a divinely inspired icon, depicting St. Peter. He needs sponsorship to finish it, so we can place it in our own chapel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39303;A young artist is working on what is clearly a divinely inspired icon, depicting John the Baptist. He needs sponsorship to finish it, so we can place it in our own chapel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39304;A young artist is working on what is clearly a divinely inspired icon, depicting St. George. He needs sponsorship to finish it, so we can place it in our own chapel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39310;I devote myself to the service of the Church, and eradicating her enemies. I have not yet fallen to any of the mortal sins, nor do I shy away from danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39311;I am a fallen man. What was once a noble knight, is now just a mere sinner. I am not a true knight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39400;The [From.Religion.GetName] heresy has appeared in the county of [From.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39401;Disturbing news! Heresy apparently appeared in a [catholic.GetName] county over two years ago and the ruler has done nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39402;To find that you have a county in your demesne that has turned heretic is bad enough. But I am shocked to learn that you have let this situation be for over two years! This heresy must be rooted out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39403;Heresy has appeared in a [catholic.GetName] county. I will encourage the local ruler to swiftly deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39404;Troubling news has reached me about a heretic county in your demesne. I urge you to swiftly deal with this problem as this heresy must be rooted out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39410;There are rumors that one of the rulers of Christendom is employing a heretic in their court. This is not acceptable to the Church, and this earthly lord will surely be damned unless we intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39441;I am most concerned that you allow heretics as your advisors. They should immediately be removed from position their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39445;My liege has a heretic as one of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] advisors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39446;My liege, I am shocked to find that you have appointed a heretic as one of your advisors.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39500;The infidel dhimmis in [Root.GetName] are now a minority, and most people have embraced [Root.Holder.Religion.GetName] Islam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39501;The people of §Y[From.GetName]§! have embraced the §Y[From.Holder.Religion.GetName]§! faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39600;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a preacher in the service of [From.Liege.GetTitledName], has arrived in [From.Location.GetName] to spread the gospel of their foreign religion. He has little regard for our old faith, declaring it sinful, and he has explained in detail the horrors we shall suffer in the afterlife unless we mend our ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39601;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has continued preaching his religion in [From.Location.GetName], and he seems to be gathering a larger and larger audience. After listening to one of his sermons, you have to admit that the new faith may have some advantages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39602;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has fallen under the sway of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and the religion he preaches. After listening to the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s sermons, [From.GetFirstName] has completely abandoned the old ways, and now only offers prayers to [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39603;You come upon [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] wrestling like children on the ground and screaming obscenities at each another. It would seem the two preachers have had a difference of opinion. As soon as they see you, they stop what they're doing and both immediately demand the expulsion of the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39604;My liege, I have arrived safely in [FromFrom.Location.GetName] and the local ruler has given me permission to remain here and spread the true faith. May [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomGodName] grant me the strength to endure the heathen ways of these savages...\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39605;Soon after [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] arrived in [FromFrom.Location.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] ordered his imprisonment. Your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] is now languishing in the dungeons of this pagan lord. Who can tell what the savages will do to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39606;My liege, I bring good news! Thanks to my efforts, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has seen the light and converted to the true faith. I shall return to your court forthwith, as my work here is done.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39607;My liege, I bring bad news. Although I seemed to be making progress in encouraging [From.GetTitledFirstName] to abandon [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, [From.GetSheHe] had a sudden change of heart. I have been banished from [FromFrom.Location.GetName], and I say good riddance! Let these stubborn savages suffer the eternal horror that await them in the afterlife!\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39608;You have received word that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been imprisoned by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. It seems the [FromFrom.GetTitle] took offense when your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] converted one of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] courtiers away from heathenry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39609;My liege, that vile savage [From.GetTitledFirstName] has banished me from [From.GetHerHis] lands! I got into a minor... dispute with a preacher who was there to spread his faith at the behest of another lord, and [From.GetFirstName] foolishly took [supported_preacher.GetHerHis] side.\n\nSigned,\n[banished_preacher.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_39617;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nOur Liege, the [GetRootFromCompliment] [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] has, in [From.GetHerHis] great wisdom, decided to adopt the [From.Religion.GetName] faith. As [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetLordSpiritualName], I would suggest that you consider doing the same.\n\nIn service of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName],\n[convert_lord_spiritual.GetBestName], [From.GetLordSpiritualName] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39640;The schism at the heart of Islam dates back to its earliest days. The majority Sunnis have long persecuted the followers of Ali, the Shias, forcing them into hiding. The partisans of Ali look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now though, the Shias are mobilizing their strength behind a boy whom they claim to be Ali's rightful heir and Imam. Other Islamic jurists claim that the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the person they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39660;Christian Pilgrims to the the Holy Land suffer all manner of abuse and the routes are not safe. In order to protect the pilgrims and secure Jerusalem for Christ and the faithful, His Holiness, [Root.GetTitledName], has accepted the possibility of an outright invasion by joint Christian forces. This signals a new era of large scale Christian holy wars - the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39661;The Roman Empire in the East. Byzantium - Christianity's firm bulwark against the Mohammedan infidels of the Orient - is failing. The dire situation has convinced His Holiness, [Root.GetTitledName], to accept the possibility of an outright invasion by joint Christian forces. This signals a new era of large scale Christian holy wars - the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39662;Rome, the city of Saint Peter and the very seat of the Papacy itself, has fallen to infidels. In response, the Pope-in-exile, His Holiness, [Root.GetTitledName], has declared his intention to forge a great alliance of Christian lords in order to reclaim the eternal city. This signals a new era of large scale Christian holy wars - the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39663;The very heartlands of Western Christianity are under siege by infidels! Desperate Christian lords have persuaded His Holiness, [Root.GetTitledName], to declare his intention of forging a great and righteous alliance to expel the heathens in the name of God. This signals a new era of large scale Christian holy wars - the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39670;His Magnificence, [Root.GetTitledName], has been convinced by his [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s that it is time to declare another era of Great Conquests, such as was the case under the first Caliphs. The Dar al-Islam must grow again. All righteous Muslim men should prepare to join the ranks of the mujahideen for the upcoming struggles. This signals a renewed era of Islamic expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39671;The Holy City of Jerusalem, where the Prophet was taken up to heaven, has fallen to infidels! His Magnificence, [Root.GetTitledName], will not let this stand, and has declared that another era of Great Conquests is upon us, such as was the case in the days of the first Caliphs. The Dar al-Islam must be defended! All righteous Muslim men should prepare to join the ranks of the mujahideen for the upcoming struggles. This signals a renewed era of Islamic expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39672;The unthinkable has happened! The holy city of Mecca has fallen to infidels and the Kaaba is even now being defiled by their very presence. His Magnificence, [Root.GetTitledName], has declared that an era of renewed Jihad is upon the world. The holy city must be retaken at all costs. All righteous Muslim men should prepare to join the ranks of the mujahideen for the upcoming struggles. This signals a renewed era of Islamic expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39673;The House of Islam is under grave threat from the onslaught of heathens and infidels in its very heartlands. In response, His Magnificence, [Root.GetTitledName], has declared that an era of renewed Jihad is upon the world. The core regions of the Dar al-Islam must be retaken at all costs. All righteous Muslim men should prepare to join the ranks of the mujahideen for the upcoming struggles. This signals a renewed era of Islamic expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39674;The House of Islam is under grave threat from the onslaught of heathens and infidels in Africa. In response, His Magnificence, [Root.GetTitledName], has declared that an era of renewed Jihad is upon the world. The western regions of the Ummah must be retaken at all costs. All righteous Muslim men should prepare to join the ranks of the mujahideen for the upcoming struggles. This signals a renewed era of Islamic expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39680;In response to the new era of Crusades and Jihads among the Abrahamic monotheists, the Great [Root.GetTitledName] has informed all [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s of [Root.GetPossPronoun] plans for a magnificent [Root.Religion.GetName] Pagan response. In fact, all pagan heads of religion may now declare Great Holy Wars. This could be the beginning of unprecedented Heathen aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39703A;Rome for centuries the center of Christendom is in Fraticelli hands. This has given me an opportunity to create a Fraticelli Papacy which shall do away with the scandalous display of wealth that the Catholic Papacy has long been guilty of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39703B;Rome for centuries the center of Christendom is in Fraticelli hands. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has therefore seen fit to create a Fraticelly Papacy claiming it shall do away with the scandalous display of wealth that the Catholic Papacy has long been guilty of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39704A;As the great city of Constantinople is in Iconoclast hands I have taken this chance to create the Iconoclast Patriarchate so that it may do away with the heretical idolatry the Ecumenical Patriarchate has long been guilty of. The new Iconoclast Patriarch shall soon take up his abode in the offices historically occupied by his Ecumenical predecessors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39706A;The Hagia Sofia for centuries the center of Orthodox Christendom is now back in Orthodox hands.

The Ecumenical Patriarch shall soon take up his abode in the offices historically occupied by his predecessors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39800;I should dedicate myself to a particular deity so that I may rule more effectively. Desi would bless the realm with wealth while Parn would bring me good fortune. Nanaiya, Goddess of fertility, would ensure that my dynasty never ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39801;Choosing any of these as a personal deity would be a testament to my piety. Weshparkar, God of wind, both creates and destroys. Wishaghn, God of victory, would guide my armies in battle and Zurvan, the eternal God of time, would offer me divine wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39802;I should dedicate myself to a particular deity so that I may rule more effectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39812;Bema is the most important religious event for us Manichaeans. It is held in honor of the Prophet Mani and his suffering at the hands of Shahanshah Shapur I. During vernal equinox, we gather to remember the deeds of our prophet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39813;You have been invited to join your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], at the Bema feast [From.GetSheHe] is hosting this year. This ritual dinner is held during vernal equinox and involves remembering the life and death of our Prophet Mani.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39815;The festival begins. The five-stepped altar has been covered in precious fabrics. Guests have fasted before the festival to purify themselves for the holy occasion. As the Mahistan leading the ceremony kneels in prayer, everyone else does the same and bows their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39816;Bema goes on for a long time, with prayers, remembrance of Mani's deeds and studying of the holy books. All those in attendance feel humbled by the wisdom of our Prophet. Truly, Mani, the Seal of the Prophets, was a blessing for all mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39817;The Bema lasts well into the night, but all good things must end. You return home to celebrate the rest of Passover, but you and most of the other guests seem to agree that the Bema dinner was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39820;According to legend, Persian king Hushang discovered the secret of fire in the hallowed past and brought it to benefit all people. We Mazdans celebrate this with the 'Jashn-e-Sadeh' festival. It is held to honor fire and to defeat the forces of darkness, frost, and cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39823;A festive mood is in the air! Bonfires are being built near the temples and lakes, fathers have taken their sons to gather wood for the pyres, while the women prepare food for the festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39824;All is ready for the Jashn-e-Sadeh. The temples are full of worshippers, people gather wood for the fires and a festive mood is growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39825;A group of priests carry the sacred fire to the throne room. Your vassals follow them and are directed to their seats by servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39826;A group of Mobads has brought forth a sacred fire from a nearby temple. You and other guests follow them to your liege's feast hall and take your designated seats in the banquet table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
