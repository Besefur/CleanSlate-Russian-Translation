EVTDESCHF10513;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nThe lands of [my_war_target_holder.GetTitledFirstName] are right there, ripe for the picking! If you seek to impress [Root.Society.GetName], [Root.GetMarchSail] [my_war_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF10513_B;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nI must admit, I have been wondering when you are finally going to be honest with me and attempt to seize my lands. In fact, allow me to issue a formal challenge to you: if you covet [my_war_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName], come and claim it!\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF10521;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nIt has come to our attention that your [recruit_to_be.GetSonDaughter] [recruit_to_be.GetFirstName] remains outside of our fold. May we humbly urge you to talk to [recruit_to_be.GetHerHim] about becoming a member of [Root.Society.GetName], like [recruit_to_be.GetHerHis] [Root.GetFatherMother]?\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25502;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nRumors are that great spoils are waiting behind the walls of [wl_looting_target.GetName], waiting to be conquered by any daring raider with enough grit and ambition. \nI assume I need say nothing more...\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25503;The rumors were true! The hold of [From.GetName] was filled with treasure! Since I was the leader of the assault, I'll take the best share of the loot for myself, but I will not forget to share part of this bountiful prize with my brothers and sisters of [Root.Society.GetName], for informing me of the existence of this treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25506;As a [Root.GetSocietyRank] of [Root.Society.GetName], it is imperative that I spend enough time on my military training. Only through constant exercise I will be able to become the best warrior in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25507;As a [Root.GetSocietyRank] of [Root.Society.GetName], I must keep my mind sharp and keep refining my natural instincts if I wish to maintain the respect of my fellow warriors. I am looking forward dedicating some time outside of palace, tracking down wild creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25508;What is the point of being a warrior if I have no one to defend? I should not forget what my duties as [Root.GetTitle] are. It is time I focus my energies on ruling my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25509;It has been a long time since I properly celebrated a great victory, or invited my fellow warriors over for a feast. What is the point of accomplishing such legendary feats if they are not remembered and honored?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25505;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nIt has come to our attention that you are eschewing your duties as a member of [Root.Society.GetName] as of recently. You should be focusing on training and improving your form if you wish to compete with the rest of us. \nI hope I made myself clear.\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25505;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nIt has come to our attention that you are eschewing your duties as a member of [Root.Society.GetName] as of recently. There is much that a [Root.GetManWoman] can learn by tracking down game in the wilderness.\nDo not forget to show me some of your best trophies.\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25505;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nWhile we [Root.Society.GetName] always appreciate a good brawl, I think it is important that we always keep in mind what are we fighting for.\nYou should always keep in mind your responsibilities as a ruler.\nYou have a duty to lead and protect your subjects.\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF25505;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nWhile we [Root.Society.GetName] always appreciate a good brawl, you should also understand that there is a time for fighting and a time for enjoying oneself with the company of [lodge_hero.GetHerHis] brothers and sisters of battle. Would it kill you to organize a feast or two?\n\nSigned, [lodge_hero.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25503;Time to return home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25506;Enough talking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
