EVTDESCHF22003;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is well beyond my reach. There is no point in trying to antagonize [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22005;With [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] already rotting in a dungeon, there is not much more I can do to harass [antagonize_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22008;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] awaits [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] imminent death lying senseless in [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] bed. I do not think there is anything left that I can do to increase [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22009;I cannot stand [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] takes every opportunity to insult and berate me. Clearly, this [From.GetManWoman] wishes to be my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22010;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thoroughly hates me by now and likely wishes me dead. The feeling is, of course, mutual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22021;[Root.GetRandomSlanderDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22022;[GetRandomSlanderReactionDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22023;It looks like [From.GetTitledFirstName] is exclusively concerned with preventing the rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim] from in any way jeopardizing [From.GetHerHis] legitimacy. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to perceive my attack more as an annoyance than the grievous insult I intended...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22024;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s humility outweighs [From.GetHerHis] dignity, apparently. Far from being insulted by the rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my slander as rightful criticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22025;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s kindness outweighs [From.GetHerHis] dignity, apparently. Far from being insulted by the rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to forgive me for my accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22026;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has such a cynical mind that my insults rang hollow to [From.GetHerHis] ears. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not care at all about everybody knowing of [From.GetHerHis] wickedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22027;Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is furious. The rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim] have really gone under [From.GetHerHis] skin. After all, how could [From.GetSheHe] deny any of them in good faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22028;It seems my attempt to antagonize [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had some unsavory expect on the mind of my victim - [From.GetFirstName] appears to be a lot more stressed after being subjected to the vile rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22029;It seems my attempt to antagonize [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had some unsavory expect on the mind of my victim - [From.GetFirstName] appears to feel a lot more miserable after being subjected to the vile rumors I spread about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22030;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s recent accusations were only the last in a long series of insults [From.GetSheHe] has riddled me with. There is little doubt that this [From.GetManWoman] hates me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22031;No point in hiding my intentions any longer - [From.GetTitledFirstName] has openly declared me [From.GetHerHis] sworn enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22032;It has recently come to my attention that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and I share a common enemy in [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22033;It appears I am not the alone in despising [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. After my latest squabble with [FromFrom.GetHerHim], I have discovered a true supporter in [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Our common hatred for [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has really brought us together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22034;It appears I am not the alone in despising [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. After my latest squabble with [FromFrom.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] fully shares my hatred for [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and completely agrees with my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22035;Taunting a powerful [From.GetTitle] like [From.GetFirstName] is something many other rulers would be scared to do. News of my recent actions have earned me quite a bit of prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22036;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has made no secret of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] hatred towards [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] might be the right person to press my rightful claim against the usurper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22037;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a claimant to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s throne, has come to my court after my recent show of hostility towards the [FromFrom.GetTitle]. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that I will aid [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] struggle against [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22042;It appears that my actions permanently tarnished [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s reputation, diminishing the prestige of [From.GetHerHis] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22043;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s slanderous words have irredeemably tarnished my reputation, diminishing the prestige of my noble dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22044;It appears that my actions tarnished permanently [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s reputation as a virtuous [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22045;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s slanderous words have irredeemably tarnished my reputation as a virtuous [Root.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22046;My industry is finally starting to bear fruits. Many in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s circle of friends and family are starting to understand just how insufferable that [From.GetManWoman] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22047;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s malicious slandering has severely affected my reputation at court. Many of my subjects whisper the most outrageous lies about me, fully believing them to be the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22048;My actions have pushed [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s already fragile mind to its limits, apparently. The [From.GetManWoman] has gone completely mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22049;Was my life not miserable enough before [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to torment me? Why does [From.GetSheHe] relish so much in my pain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22051;Thanks to my connections, I was able to get in contact with a blackguard hiding in [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. The man assures me that, for a reasonable fee, he will be all too willing to undermine [antagonize_target.GetFirstName]'s authority and sow dissent amongst [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] subjects. I need only but decide what I want him to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22053;The criminal I hired was successful! He presented me with a believable claim on one of [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22054;I have just received news that, thanks to the help of a notorious criminal, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to forge a claim against some of my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22055;While the criminal was not able to fabricate a direct claim on [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s lands, he presented me with something even more interesting: a forged document attesting that one of [antagonize_target.GetFirstName]'s ancestors sworn eternal fealty towards one of my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22056;In a true show of pettiness, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is using a preposterous document to claim that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should be a vassal of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] since time immemorial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22057;The blackguard did his job properly. I have just received news that the peasants in [antagonize_target.Capital.GetName] are on the brink of an open revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22058;I am not sure how, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to turn my own subjects against me! The people of [Root.Capital.GetName] are clamoring to have me deposed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22059;The blackguard did not disappoint. Preying on the resentment of the common people for [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName], he was able to establish a cancerous criminal network within [antagonize_target.Capital.GetName]'s very walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22060;Enlisting the help of a notorious blackguard, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to sow chaos and dissent amongst my own subjects. According to my sources, [From.GetSheHe] is responsible for the intricate criminal guild that has recently taken root in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22061;My machinations are starting to bear their fruits. The man I hired has pitted most of [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s vassals against their once-beloved liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22062;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s machinations have antagonized me with most of my vassals. I am unsure how, but that [From.GetManWoman] has managed to convince a lot of my subjects that I am not deserving of their trust and loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22063;The man I hired did not disappoint me. He managed to sow the seeds of dissent within [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s very family. Many of [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] kinsmen despite [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22064;In some way, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to estrange me from my own family. [From.GetHerHisCap] machinations have caused many of my relatives to distance themselves from me out of the misplaced fear that associating with me will stain their reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22065;The blackguard was successful. He has managed to pit [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s own spouse against [antagonize_target.GetHerHim]. I have received credible reports about a falling out between the two rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22066;I don't know how, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to pit my very [Root.Spouse.GetRootRelation] against me! Someone has been feeding [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] all sorts of malicious rumors about my alleged infidelity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22067;It appears [From.GetTitledFirstName] was trying to sow dissent within my realm using a notorious criminal and forger. Luckily, my network of spies has been able to apprehend the scoundrel and send him to my dungeons, where he belongs. After a short interrogation, the man has confessed the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22068;Unfortunately, it appears the blackguard was captured. Put under torture, he revealed the name of his employer to [From.GetTitledFirstName], who has now made the entire plot public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22070;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for being a slave to [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] passion. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] unsavory lust for flesh to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22072;It seems my plan did not take into account [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s paranoid disposition. [From.GetSheHeCap] flatly refused my envoy's advances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22074;The plan worked exactly as I hoped. My envoy easily seduced [From.GetTitledFirstName], infecting [From.GetHerHim] with a terrible disease. Perhaps now [From.GetFirstName] will understand the error of [From.GetHerHis] ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22076;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for being a slave to [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] hunger. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] gluttony to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22078;Perhaps I worded my message to [From.GetTitledFirstName] poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] was angered by my gift for some reason and decided to refuse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22080;Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] could not resist gorging upon my gift. According to the latest rumors, [From.GetSheHe] now lays in [From.GetHerHis] bed, stricken by a grievous sickness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22082;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] greed. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] love for money to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22084;It would appear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s humility has gotten in the way of my plan. Word has it that [From.GetFirstName] has locked the forged artifact I gifted [From.GetHerHim] away from sight, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy of carrying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22086;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift and could not resist flaunting it to [From.GetHerHis] friends and subjects. I have just received news that [From.GetSheHe] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] to shame in front of a foreign envoy a few days ago, when the forgery was revealed accidentally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22088;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] slothful, apathetic attitude. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] distaste for all laborious tasks to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22090;It appears that [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not care enough about the legitimacy of [From.GetHerHis] borders in order to fall from my falsified report. [From.GetHerHisCap] inconstant nature must be the cause of this blunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22092;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] spent a lot of time and resources only to discover that the report I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was false.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22094;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] short temper. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] lack of patience to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22096;My attempt to have [From.GetTitledFirstName] humiliate [From.GetHerselfHimself] did not succeed. According to reports, [From.GetSheHe] forgave the people I hired to disrupt [From.GetHerHis] parade without even trying to pursue them after their infraction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22098;Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] made a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself], running around [From.Capital.GetName] smeared in mud to try and apprehend the people I hired to harass [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22100;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] spiteful and opportunist nature. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] insatiable envy to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in the false claim I provided [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] merely lacks the ambition to find my offer palatable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22104;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was just about to start a war over my false claim before [From.GetSheHe] finally realized how useless the document I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was. Now [From.GetSheHe] is boiling in [From.GetHerHis] own bile, all [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a quick conquest squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22106;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] pride. I am sure I can exploit [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] vain obsession with [antagonize_target.GetHerselfHimself] to my advantage in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22108;Unfortunately, although [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift, [From.GetHerHis] shy disposition prevented [From.GetHerHim] from putting the portrait on plain sight, where its true meaning would have been apparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22110;I have just received some hilarious news from [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. It appears the painting I gave [From.GetHerHim] has started to rot, both twisting the features of its subject into a ridiculous, grotesque mockery and filling [From.GetFirstName]'s palace with an unbearable stench.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22111;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s response to my attempts to slander [From.GetHerHim] has been extremely polite and reasonable, so much so that it has put me in a difficult position. It would not be appropriate for me to continue harassing [From.GetHerHim] after such a kind and thoughtful response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22112;It appears my call for peace and unity fell on deaf ears. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is too inconstant and arbitrary to care for my words, even when it comes at the expenses of [From.GetHerHis] own reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22113;Pestering [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been quite the entertaining activity. Reveling over [From.GetHerHis] misery has allowed me to get over mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22114;Pestering [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been quite the entertaining activity. Reveling over [From.GetHerHis] misery has given me much needed relief from my other responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22115;Pestering [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been quite the entertaining activity. As long as I can torment [From.GetHerHim], I can keep some my more unsavory inclinations in check during my everyday duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22116;As entertaining as tormenting [From.GetTitledFirstName] is, having to spread rumors and weave plots around [From.GetHerHim] has also been an intriguing learning experience for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22118;Seeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] squirm and yell at my covert efforts to antagonize [From.GetHerHim] has made me realize how much easier it is to ruin the reputation of an impatient [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22121;I have decided that it might be profitable to take some time and resources and try to seriously hurt my sworn enemy. \n[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] is an unbearable pestilence upon this world, and I will not rest until I will have made [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] life a living hell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22124;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is at it again, dragging [From.GetHerHis] own name through the mud as long as [From.GetSheHe] is able of besmirching mine in the process. [From.GetSheHeCap] is spreading the most disgusting rumors about me, trying to pit my own subjects against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22126;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is unbearable. [From.GetSheHeCap] wastes no occasion to mock and berate me, insulting my dynasty and my friends without pause. I do not know how much longer I will be able to endure this relentless barrage of abuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22128;Following my actions, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started spreading false reports of [From.GetHerHis] own. It appears that the efficacy of my own network of informants has been compromised, at least for the time being...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22129;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has unleashed [From.GetHerHis] spies throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. These thugs have been spreading false news to my own informants, bringing my spy network in disarray. It has become increasingly harder to trust anything these days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22131;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has entirely misunderstood my intent! Rather than being upset by my slanderous allegations, [From.GetSheHe] praised me for my refined vocabulary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22132;[From.GetFirstName] was ecstatic hearing my praise and assured me that [From.GetSheHe] has a lot more interesting names to call me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF22133;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has entirely misunderstood my intent! Rather than being upset by my slanderous allegations, [From.GetSheHe] praised me for my honesty, and even decided to knight me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP22006_A;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] has secluded [antagonize_target.GetHerselfHimself] with the rest of the court in [antagonize_target.Location.GetName], presumably biding their time while disease lingers in the countryside of the realm. "It will not be possible to reach [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] for some time", my council informs me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP22006_A_B;As both [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I are both currently weathering the disease ravaging the countryside outside, my efforts to antagonize [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] will have to be put on hold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP22006_B;As I have gone into seclusion with my court, my efforts to antagonize [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] will have to be halted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP22012;No need for any convoluted plot - merely attacking [antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s character should be enough to make it clear how much I despise [antagonize_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP23027;The people of the Book are fascinating to many [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers, who have often been ready to embrace some of the customs of their neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP22123;How can I possibly keep harassing a person that I have come to love so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP22123;[antagonize_target.GetTitledFirstName] well and truly hates me. There is no point in trying to antagonize [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF22013;I have received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has denounced me on several occasions recently, going to great lengths to besmirch my reputation, even at the expenses of [From.GetHerHis] own dignity as [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF22014;Despite making my dislike for [From.GetTitledFirstName] quite clear, [From.GetSheHe] has completely ignored my taunting. I am unsure if any of it has worked at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF22018;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s attitude towards me is becoming unbearable. The [From.GetManWoman] always takes any opportunity to irritate me, even for the smallest thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF22019;[From.GetTitledFirstName] looks far from pleased by my hostile attitude towards [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF22013;[From.GetTitledFirstName] never misses a chance to inform me of how much [From.GetSheHe] despises me. The [From.GetManWoman] is truly obsessed with me, to the detriment of both of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF22014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ignored my insults, dismissing them as the posturing of a lesser [Root.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF22018;I am not exactly sure why is [From.GetTitledFirstName] so obsessed with attacking my character at any given occasion. In truth, I could not care less about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF22019;Unfortunately, it appears [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ignored my attempts to antagonize [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF22018;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s hopeless attempts at taunting me are truly pathetic. I might have been a bit irritated by them at first, but now I find [From.GetHerHis] meaningless strutting almost amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF22019;Not only is [From.GetTitledFirstName] ignored my hostility towards [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] looks charmed by it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA22071;A young man has caught my eye this evening. Not only is he beautiful, he claims to be an important emissary from a foreign realm, with years of diplomatic experience. After exchanging a few pleasantries, he shared his desire to spend some time alone with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22073;I cannot believe it! The man I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together he had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who his real master is. Even worse, I think sleeping with him made me terribly sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22077;I have just received the biggest boar I have ever seen from [From.GetTitledFirstName], who sent it to me as a sign of friendship. The beast looks marvelous, and I cannot wait to have it cooked for my next dinner. If only it weren't for the message coming with it mockingly implying I would eat it all by myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22079;I probably shouldn't have eaten all the boar by myself. I am feeling horribly sick now, so much so that I can barely stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22083;I have just received a golden scepter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. According to the envoy who brought it to court, it is an old, priceless artifact which belonged to one of my ancestors and that [From.GetFirstName]'s scholars discovered recently at the borders of [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22085;I am beset by shame. The supposedly priceless artifact sent by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is nothing but a piece of wood painted in gold. What is worse is that the forgery was revealed just as I was explaining the history of the scepter to a foreign dignitary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22089;I have just received the most disturbing news. It has been brought to my attention that a recent survey of my lands has determined my demesne to be much smaller than I believed. All my Council members agree that I should verify the soundness of this report immediately if I do not wish to see the prestige of my realm be greatly diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22091;All of this work was for nothing! As it turns out, the survey report was a false document planted by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to undermine my authority as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22095;The musky odor of mud fills my lungs as I stare in disbelief at my soiled clothes. The two urchins run away laughing, while my parade suddenly halts in the middle of the streets and my servants start surrounding me, asking me if I am hurt and hastily starting to clean me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22097;I immediately run after the two little criminals, but they have already disappeared. In my rage, I spend hours wandering around [Root.Capital.GetName] in my pitiful state, yelling for the two scoundrels to come out. When I finally return to my [Root.GetHouse], a letter from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] awaits me, implying the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s involvement in the entire affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22101;I have just received a wonderful gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] Chancellor has recently discovered an old document legitimizing my claim on one of my neighbors' lands. [From.GetFirstName] has decided to offer it to me in a show of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22103;Unbelievable! I was just about to press my new claim, when several clear inconsistencies were discovered in [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s document. The claim [From.GetSheHe] gave me is fabricated, and, more importantly, very poorly fabricated! Hardly anybody will consider it valid if I decide to press it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22107;An envoy from [From.Capital.GetName] has just delivered sumptuous portrait depicting me, as a gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The proportions and features are a bit off, but the quality of the piece is undeniable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA22109;I cannot believe the pettiness of some people. The painting [FromFrom.GetFirstName] gave me lasted only a few days before starting to melt, twisting my features in a grotesque mockery of reality and filling the main hall with a foul stench. What is worse, many dignitaries saw it before I was informed of the problem and hastily ordered the rotting artwork to be removed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB22071;A young woman has caught my eye this evening. Not only is she beautiful, she claims to be an important emissary from a foreign realm, with years of diplomatic experience. After exchanging a few pleasantries, she shared her desire to spend some time alone with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB22073;I cannot believe it! The woman I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together she had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who her real master is. Even worse, I think that sleeping with him made me terribly sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF22003;Does [antagonize_target.GetSheHe] still think of me, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22008;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22009;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22010;We shall be enemies to the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22013;I will simply ignore [From.GetHerHis] posturing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22014;Perhaps I should try something more personal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22015;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22018;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22021;Best act with subtlety...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22022;I know exactly what [From.GetSheHe] is trying to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22023;I should have used a harsher wording.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22024;Has [From.GetSheHe] no self-respect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22025;Has [From.GetSheHe] no self-respect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22026;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22028;What a pleasant surprise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22029;Wouldn't it be a shame if [From.GetSheHe] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] out of [From.GetHerHis] misery...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22030;And I hate [From.GetHerHim] back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22031;We are rivals from this day forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22032;Perhaps we could be friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22033;I am glad to have you as my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22034;How very nice of you to say so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22035;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22036;I will travel to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] court at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22037;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22042;As [From.GetSheHe] deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22043;Why do people listen to [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22044;As [From.GetSheHe] deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22045;Why do people listen to [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22046;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22047;How could this happen?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22048;How amusing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22049;I cannot stand this anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22051;I wish to claim [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22053;Marvelous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22054;Does [From.GetSheHe] know no decency?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22055;So [antagonize_target.GetSheHe] should be *my* vassal now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22056;Over my dead body!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22057;One can only hope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22058;This is impossible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22060;Damn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22062;How could [From.GetSheHe]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22064;How could [From.GetSheHe]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22066;Does [From.GetSheHe] hold nothing sacred?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22067;Truly, a dishonorable display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22068;He should have died before talking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22070;I know just the person...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22071;No! I don't trust you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22072;I will try something different next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22073;That fiend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22074;Justice is served.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22076;I know exactly what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22077;If that's the case, I will eat none of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22078;I will have to try something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22079;This is all [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22080;How predictable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22082;A good old forgery will teach [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22083;This is too sacred a relic for me to flaunt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22084;Curses. I will have to try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22085;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22086;How amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22088;Did [antagonize_target.GetSheHe] survey [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] borders recently?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22089;Who cares? It is just a piece of scroll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22090;I will have to try something different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22091;I am so tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22092;At least [From.GetSheHe] did something for a change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22094;Is there not a parade in [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] honor soon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22095;It was but children...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22096;[From.GetHerHis] kind nature is to blame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22097;Why is [FromFrom.GetSheHe] tormenting me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22100;A fake claim, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22101;Thank you, but I do not need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22102;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22103;This was all a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22104;Pathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22106;Call for the court painter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22107;The portrait is nice, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22108;I will have to try something different...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22109;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22110;What an unexpected turn of events!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22111;Psh, I don't care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22113;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22114;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22115;And everyone loves me for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22116;The more I know, the more I can hurt [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22117;Truth is for the foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22118;I must be calm if I do not wish to suffer the same fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22121;I will spread false reports to [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] spies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22129;Two can play this game, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22131;Do not worry, [From.GetFirstName], I have much more to say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22132;Hopefully they will all be as endearing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF22133;You can always count on me to tell the truth, my [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP22006;If only we had pigeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP22012;Let everybody in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP22123;Understandable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP22012;I will make my disdain clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP22012;A private message will be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP22012;Better wait for something more concrete...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF22021;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a most disgraceful [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF22022;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHF22021;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTLUAHF22022;[From.GetSheHeCap] just needs a good beating, that is all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTLUBHF22022;Such poetry and wit, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTLUCHF22022;For your admirable honesty, I dub thee Sir [From.GetFirstName] of the Turnip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTYHF22022;I will not tolerate this offense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF22022;Surely I can convince [From.GetHerHim] to stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF22013;The entirety of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is laughing at me, thanks to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s damnable actions. I have received news from many travelers going through [From.GetHerHis] realm that the most absurd rumors about me are being spread by the [From.GetTitle]'s officials themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF22014;All of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is laughing at [From.GetTitledFirstName], yet from what I hear [From.GetSheHe] is completely unmoved by my slandering campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF22015;My efforts to smear and antagonize [From.GetTitledFirstName] have been a complete success. I might have lost some of my reputation in the process, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] looks furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF22018;I truly cannot stand [From.GetTitledFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to revel in every misfortune that befalls upon me and never misses an opportunity to taunt and insult me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF22019;My hostile attitude towards [From.GetTitledFirstName] has not gone unnoticed. [From.GetSheHeCap] hates me more every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF22018;How quaint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF22021;Such excesses are unacceptable for a [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF22022;No matter what [From.GetSheHe] said, I forgive [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF22051;Sow dissent amongst [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF22121;[antagonize_target.GetSheHeCap] shall never know peace for as long as I live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF22131;Perhaps I should rethink my strategy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF22018;Such a pitiful [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF22021;Infidels deserve no compassion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF22022;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF22051;This is too underhanded for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF22121;Better to bide my time for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF22005;[antagonize_target.GetSheHeCap] will get out of there sooner or later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22010;My work with [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22013;When will [From.GetSheHe] stop tormenting me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22018;I cannot stand that [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22021;Who could love such a freak?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22022;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22032;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is a good [FromFrom.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22051;Cause unrest in [antagonize_target.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22070;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22071;But of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22076;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22077;But I *will* eat it all myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22082;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22083;What a marvelous addition to my crown jewels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22088;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22089;This is going to be so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22094;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22095;I will whip those dogs myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22100;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22101;Just what I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22106;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22107;It deserves to remain in plain sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22111;Fine, I will leave [From.GetHerHim] be for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22121;I will spread the most vile rumors about [antagonize_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22124;Will [From.GetSheHe] ever stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22126;Just leave me in peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22129;Troublesome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22131;I will just have to try harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF22133;Just a knighthood?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP22123;[antagonize_target.GetFirstName] has become one of my dearest friends. I should stop antagonizing [antagonize_target.GetHerHim] so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
