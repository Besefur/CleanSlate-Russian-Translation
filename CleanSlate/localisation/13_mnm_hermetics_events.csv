EVTDESC_MNM_100;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\nWe are delighted to learn that you have taken your first step towards enlightenment. The secrets of the Corpus may be obscured to you now, but in time you may come to understand them as I have.\n\nHold in thy mind all thou wouldst know, and [Root.GetHermesThriceBlessed], will teach thee.\nSigned, [inviter.GetSocietyRank] [inviter.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1100;A truly useful Laboratory can take both time and money to assemble but without an office dedicated to alchemy I doubt I will ever be able to unveil the deeper secrets of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1101;Secrecy is of great importance as the experiments I will perform in my laboratory may both frighten the ignorant and tantalize my fellow alchemists. To keep intruders away laboratories are often built deep within a castle, but a more accessible building would likely be more efficient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1102;In order to properly heat and transform metals or other substances I require furnaces of differing temperature and flames of different types. The alchemical texts speak of various setups that could be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1103;The glass in which I keep my concoctions is brittle and breaks easily. This may be tolerable for beakers and other dispensable glass but earlier today a giant alembic shattered into a thousand pieces after having been heated carelessly by one of my helpers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1104;Not all pottery is suited for the kind of alchemical work I do. My experiments require both the porous orange pottery that can absorb components in the crucible and the dark and highly fire resistant pots in which even the strongest metal can be melted. Good quality does come at a high price however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1105;The local smiths do not seem to appreciate the great care that must be taken to create the kind of tools we need to work the fires of my laboratory. Perhaps in time they will learn but so far the results have been most disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1106;Sometimes the difference identifying success can be as hard as achieving it. Many metals and other substances are so alike that only an expert can tell them apart. To avoid mishaps perhaps it would be best to invest in a rich library of reference literature to avoid unwelcome surprises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1108;It may not be the most advanced office of alchemy, in fact it might well be the opposite of that, but I have finally completed a laboratory in which to conduct my experiments. Soon the secrets of this world will reveal themselves to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1109;The work to create an office in which I can conduct my experiments is finally complete! It may not compare to the greatest laboratories of this age but it will surely help me find the knowledge which I seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1110;My laboratory is finally completed. Will it be able to fulfill my dreams of enlightenment? Only time will tell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1111;After months of hard work and a considerable amount of money spent, the laboratory of [Root.GetFullName] is the envy of anyone who wishes to delve into the deeper secrets of life. This office of alchemy allows the [Root.GetTitle] to perform any experiment that has so far been documented and is a testament to [Root.GetHerHis] great ambitions in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1112;With no expenses spared and under the constant supervision of [Root.GetFullName] a house unlike any other has been erected to realize the dream of a perfect alchemical working environment. Many of the contraptions have been conceived and drawn by the [Root.GetTitle] personally and the great number of furnaces alone employs a team of helpers from the entire realm.\n\nThe office now stands ready to allow [Root.GetFullName] to uncover the secrets of the world, all it requires is for its master to give the instructions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1113;The entire castle just shook, waking me from the dreamless sleep that comes after hours of preparatory laboratory work. Did I forget to properly lock the laboratory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1114;To the ignorant laboratory equipment can appear both frightening and alien. Word has gotten out of some of the unusual contraptions that have been built for my laboratory. A small mob has assembled outside, demanding answers about why I am constructing so clearly ungodly things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1115;Disaster has struck! An increasingly foul stench from the kitchen area made the guards investigate my stores of alchemical ingredients. I have been focusing so much on the work of assembling my laboratory that the ingredients have begun to rot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1121;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nIt has come to my attention that you still lack a proper office of Alchemy! How can you hope to uncover the secrets of [Root.GetHermesThriceBlessed], without the proper tools or staff? You should build one or your work will fade into obscurity.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1121_apprentice;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMaster, I feel we are both held back by the lack of a proper office of Alchemy. If we are to uncover the secrets of [Root.GetHermesThriceBlessed], we will need the proper tools and work space. Unless you build a laboratory or our work here will fade into obscurity.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1122_normal;With a laboratory of my own I can proceed to perform greater works than ever before. How I ever got by without a dedicated workspace and the right tools I will never understand. The secrets of [Root.GetHermesThriceBlessed], shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1122_rich;My new laboratory is the envy of both those that now live and all that came before me. I dare say even [Root.GetHermesThriceBlessed], himself would be impressed by the setup I now employ to uncover the hidden secrets of matter and spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1200_A;As I place my hands on the sides of the bowl, the surface of the water is perfectly still. Yet it only takes a few moments before patterns begin to appear in the reflection... Mirror images of the world, the past and the future. I take a deep breath, to attune myself to what I am looking for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1200_B;I place the bowl before me and wait for the water to be perfectly still. A regular scrying would allow me to choose a focus for my thoughts â€“ on the other hand, I could use something from my shelves of alchemy in order to create something unseen before... The reflection on the water ripples as I let out a deep breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_BATTLE_A;The water is dark. I stare at it, unblinking, until my eyes begin to strain. It takes time, maybe hours, as time becomes fleeting.\nThen I see it. A fierce battle! I can almost hear the clanking of swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_BATTLE_B;It takes a minute, but after a while I am certain of it: I see a lion! Or... No, it's a woman. With the head of a lion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_BATTLE_C;I concentrate for a long time, staring into the water. I almost have time to doubt myself, but then I see it: faint ripples, a shadow, then two. It looks like a fire, and a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_POWER_A;I see strange patterns... No, wait, a bunch of triangles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_POWER_B;There are just lines... Or are they...? Yes, I see a forest. A vast forest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_POWER_C;I see a storm. I can almost hear it! Oh, it is actually raining.\n\n... But I still see a thunderstorm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_A;I see... A still pond of water. It is... quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_B;At first, all I the water shows me is the reflection of the ceiling. I shake my head. I have to look beyond the material world! I close my eyes, and when I open them again, I see it clearly.\nA bed of flowers, and an urn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_C;I am at first not sure what to make of the strange shape. Maybe I am imagining it, or maybe it is a shadow. Does it matter? I see it clearly: a familiar silhouette, standing under a moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1202_A;The battle is fierce and I have gained new skills! The vision I have been carrying in my heart certainly holds true! My personal guard are being left behind as I charge into battle. I am amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1202_B;The battle rages on and I am surprised by every arrow that I deflect and by every blow that misses me. I have been waiting for something terrible to happen, yet [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] does not seem finished with me. I suppose there is a chance that I have misinterpreted the vision I had? I feel pretty great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1203_A;As the battle rages on, I am not surprised by the heavy losses we are taking. Every arrow that sears over my head makes my pulse quicken. Just as I am becoming convinced that this is the battle I saw in my vision, I stumble from a sharp pain in my leg. An arrows sticks out from my knee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1203_B;We have been fighting this war for what feels like an eternity and I fail to see how anything good can come of all this bloodshed. Just as I am beginning to think that I misinterpreted the vision I had, I am hit by something, hard. An arrow sticks out from my knee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1204_A;I meet the stare of my newborn [From.GetSonDaughter] for the first time and it is clear that my vision has come true! Rarely have I seen such clear signs of intelligence and ambition in one so young. [From.GetFirstName] is the child that was promised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1204_B;I am not sure what I was expecting, but this child blinks at me with the most curious eyes. I suddenly feel all my worries wash away. I must have misunderstood the vision I had scrying in the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1205_A;My worst fears have come true. Behind the dull stare of my newborn baby [From.GetSonDaughter] there can be little in the way of brilliance or even ability. In time I will know for sure but I am already convinced that this is the child my vision warned me about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1205_B;I am not sure what I was expecting, but this newborn child blinks at me with the dullest of eyes. I feel my confidence wain as I hold [From.GetHerHim] and I soon give [From.GetHerHim] back to the nurse. I must have misunderstood the vision I had in the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1208_A;My lover has passed away. I knew it would happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1208_B;My lover has passed away. Was this what my vision in the water was about? How was I to know? Oh, woe is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1209_A;My dear friend has passed. I knew it would happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1209_B;My dear friend has passed. Was this what my vision in the water was about? How was I to know? Oh, woe is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1210_A;Hah! My rival has passed. I knew it would happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1210_B;My rival has passed. And here I thought something bad would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1211_A;My [mnm_scrying_dead.GetFatherMother] has passed. I knew it would happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1211_B;My [mnm_scrying_dead.GetFatherMother] has passed. Was this what my vision in the water was about? How was I to know? Oh, woe is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1212_A;My [mnm_scrying_dead.GetSonDaughter] has passed. I knew it would happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1212_B;My [mnm_scrying_dead.GetSonDaughter] has passed. Was this what my vision in the water was about? How was I to know? Oh, woe is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1214_A;Some time has passed since... my beloved pet passed. Having thought about it, I realize that this must be what my vision was about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1214_A_lunatic;Some time has passed since... my pet passed. Having thought about it, I have become certain that this is what my vision was about. Perhaps there was a curse, and my vision was the only warning. Oh, that poor little ball of fluff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1214_B;Some time has passed since my pet died. Was this what my vision in the water was about? How was I to know? Oh, woe is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1214_B_lunatic;It has been some time since my pet left this world. I'm beginning to think it was no curse, but perhaps it was I? WHAT IF I FORETOLD ITS DEMISE?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1215_A;I have gained the [From.GetFullName]! I knew something good would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1215_B;I have gained the [From.GetFullName]! This is... not what I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1219_A;I have lost the [FromFrom.GetFullName]! I knew something bad would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1219_B;I have lost the [FromFrom.GetFullName]! This is... not what I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1220_A;So I suppose the vision was about me having [Root.GetDisease]. I knew something bad would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1220_B;So I suppose the vision was about me having [Root.GetDisease]. That could have been clearer, I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1221_A;So I suppose the vision was about my [GetFromRelation] having [From.GetDisease]. I knew something bad would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1221_B;So I suppose the vision was about my [GetFromRelation] having [From.GetDisease]... That could have been clearer, I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1221_C;So I suppose the vision was about how I was to get [From.GetDisease]. I knew something bad would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1221_D;So I suppose the vision was about how I was to get [From.GetDisease]... That could have been clearer, I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1222_A;So I suppose the vision was about me being cured of my disease! I knew something good would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1222_B;So I suppose the vision was about me having rid myself of disease? That could have been clearer, I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1223_A;So I suppose the vision was about my [GetFromRelation] combating [From.GetHerHis] disease. I knew something good would happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1223_B;So I am starting to think that the vision I had was about my [GetFromRelation] combating [From.GetHerHis] disease...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_A;One of my hunting parties caught a great white boar today. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] must have sent us this creature, as it took ten men to bring the beast down, and the effect it has had on my soldiers is clearly the boon I have been waiting for. 'Bards are already composing songs, my [Root.GetLordLady]', a captain tells me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_B;One of my hunting parties caught a great white boar today. I am told it took ten men to bring the beast down, and rumors of the effect it has had on my soldiers is already spreading through court. 'Bards are already composing songs, my [Root.GetLordLady]', a captain tells me. This certainly goes against my expectations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_C;I am not sure whether it is a new-found interest in [envisioned_friend.GetEducationSubject] that we have been connecting over, or simply the infectious laughter of [envisioned_friend.GetTitledFirstName], but we are spending more and more time together. I feel like we are bonding, like true friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_D;I am not sure whether it is a new-found interest in [envisioned_friend.GetEducationSubject], or if there is something about [envisioned_friend.GetHerHis] [envisioned_friend.GetFriendEnjoyableQuirk], but I am really connecting with [envisioned_friend.GetTitledFirstName]. We have been spending more and more time together, and I think [envisioned_friend.GetSheHe] makes me a better [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_E;I am told a peculiar tale of an owl, which has taken up residence under the roofing of one of our barracks. The guards have tried chasing it off, but it keeps returning. "Perhaps it is also a seeker?" I offer to one of my advisors, who responds: "My distinguished [Root.GetLordLady], it would make for a very distinguished pet...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_F;I am told of an owl having taken up residence under the roofing of our barracks. One of my advisors suggest I make it a pet. But should not my scrying have revealed the symbol of wisdom to me, if this creature is what it was about? 'Do not dwell on this, [Root.GetMasterMistress]', my steward says, handing me the caged bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_A;During a hunt with my kinsmen, I am struck by the beauty of a white stag. However, the joy is short-lived as the magnificent beast charges at me. I am suddenly reminded of the terrible vision I had, and I yank the reigns of my horse tight in retreat. "Protect the [Root.GetTitle]!" I hear, just before the sound of a flying arrow is cut short. I groan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_B;During a hunt with my kinsmen, I am struck by the beauty of a white stag. However, the joy is short-lived as the magnificent beast charges at me. Suddenly reminded of the wonderful vision I had, I attempt to stare the beast down. To my surprise, it has no effect. "Protect the [Root.GetTitle]!" I hear, just before the sound of a flying arrow is cut short. I groan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_C;[envisioned_rival.GetTitledFirstName] has been overheard spreading foul gossip about me. I am not certain what I did to deserve this treatment, but remembering my vision of agony, I have decided not to fight it. Perhaps [envisioned_rival.GetHerHis] vile feelings towards me are simply a result of the stars traversing the sky?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_D;[envisioned_rival.GetTitledFirstName] has been overheard spreading foul gossip about me. I am not certain what I did to deserve this treatment, but remembering my vision, I am beginning to doubt my interpretation of it. Perhaps [envisioned_rival.GetHerHis] hostility is simply a result of the stars traversing the sky?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_E;There has been a merchant visiting [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] recently. At first it seemed that their odd trinkets and potions were simply the works of a wandering herbalist. However, it appears that the man has swindled several of my subjects for money, using fearful tales of necessary wards and rituals to be performed, 'lest demons will beset us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1226_F;There has been a merchant visiting [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] recently. Recalling my vision, I initially reacted well to this wandering herbalist, as he seemed to be providing comfort to my subjects, with his trinkets and curious concoctions. However, it appears that the man has swindled several of my subjects for money, threatening that demons will beset us all unless his goods are bought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1227;Nothing has happened that I can attribute to my vision in the water. I'm starting to think I didn't see anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1250;The stars hold many secrets, but they are not indecipherable. Using the right instruments, and frame of mind, I will uncover the destiny of [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1251_diplomat;After spending many nights analyzing the movements of the stars, I have noticed [Root.GetRandomPlanetName] moving into a sign influencing that of my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]... I am fairly certain that this indicates that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is destined for a position of diplomacy, with wits and charm uncommon amongst most of our members at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1251_fighter;After spending many nights analyzing the movements of the stars, I have noticed [Root.GetRandomPlanetName] moving into a sign influencing that of my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]... I am fairly certain that this indicates that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is destined for the battlefield and a combat prowess uncommon amongst most of our members at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1251_schemer;After spending many nights analyzing the movements of the stars, I have noticed [Root.GetRandomPlanetName] moving into a sign influencing that of my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]... I am fairly certain that this indicates that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is destined for intrigue and cleverness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1251_scholar;After spending many nights analyzing the movements of the stars, I have noticed the moon moving into a sign influencing that of my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]... I am fairly certain that this indicates that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is destined for studying, and an intellect uncommon amongst most of our members at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1251_steward;After spending many nights analyzing the movements of the stars, I have noticed [Root.GetRandomPlanetName] moving into a sign influencing that of my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]... I am fairly certain that this indicates that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is destined for administrative tasks and a practical mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1252_A;My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] has been spending many nights staring at the sky and telling me of the grand things that the stars have in store for me. "You'll make a fine [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] one day", [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] says. While I am not sure what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] means, I have noticed that [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] looks at me differently lately... Perhaps with pride?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1252_B;My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] has been spending many nights staring at the sky. A servant told me that it is for my own good. I am not sure what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] gets from it, but I have noticed that [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] looks at me differently lately... "What good is another [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]?" [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] sighs, and walks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1252_C;Before [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] passed away, I'm told that [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] spent many nights staring at the sky and telling me of the grand things that the stars have in store for me. I am not sure what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] meant, but I I have heard servants whispering about it. They say [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] thought I was destined for greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1252_D;Before [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] passed away, I'm told that [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] spent many nights staring at the sky, talking to [horoscope_maker.GetHerselfHimself]. Servants tell me it was about my destiny, and that my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] did not think the stars were in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_diplomat;It does not take anybody long to notice that [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is a thoughtful [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl], well attuned to the feelings of others. [horoscope_child.GetSheHeCap] is increasingly curious about foreign customs, and is often found engaging in conversation with servants and visitors alike. "[Root.GetFatherMotherCap]? What is it like to grow up outside of the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]?", [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] asked me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_fighter;Often found near the sparring grounds, [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is proving surprisingly apt with a spear. Of course the wooden thing is merely a toy, but the faces of my commanders during their practice with [horoscope_child.GetHerHim] hints of a surprising talent in the [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_schemer;[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] has always had a keen eye for intrigue. Reading my letters, eavesdropping on council meetings â€“ the [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl] has little respect for privacy. Yet it is hard to say what motivates [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] mischief. Meanwhile, the court seems to think that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is growing up to be the brightest member of house [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_scholar;I know that [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is well-read for [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] age, but I did not realize the extent of it â€“ the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] archivist recently complained to me: "The young [horoscope_child.GetLordLady] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] made notations in the margin of one the works, [Root.GetMasterMistress]..." Flustered, he continues: "I'd consider it blasphemy, but [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] calculations were also right.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_steward;As [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] has been growing older, [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] has been seen expressing [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] sense for organization whenever the opportunity has arisen. I am not even sure where [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] got [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] hands on an abacus, but [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] carries it around wherever [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_diplomat;As I am walking around the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] catches up with me. "My [Root.GetLordLady], the council is most pleased with your assessment of their proposal", [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] says, a wide smile on [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] face. [inspiring_adult.GetSheHeCap] has increasingly been encouraging me to partake in diplomatic meetings. "Do you not believe, as your [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother], that it is your destiny, to help people?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_fighter;I wipe the sweat from my brow as [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] points out the flaws in my parrying technique. I'm glad that a [inspiring_adult.GetEducationRole] like [inspiring_adult.GetHerHim] takes time out of [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] schedule to spar with me, and fighting has in some ways become part of who I am. I sometimes wonder whether my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] was right... Are my battles already written in the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_schemer;[inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] has often inspired me to keep my eyes and ears sharp... So when I find [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] notes carelessly strewn around [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] quarters, I cannot help but wonder if [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] intended for me to find them. "From every [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], [Root.GetSheHe] could be the one we will remember... Will the young [Root.GetLordLady] refuse what the heavens have so clearly laid out for [Root.GetHerHim]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_scholar;"Reading has always come naturally to you, child", [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] tells me, leaning in over my notes. "Your writing is improving as well", [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] adds, walking back to [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] seat by the window. The [Root.GetCapitalHolding] is unusually quiet today and outside the sun is shining. Lost in thought, my mind drifts to my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother]'s horoscope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_steward;As [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] leans over the [inspiring_adult.GetEducationTool], I find myself steering the conversation back to the architecture of our [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. [inspiring_adult.GetSheHeCap] knows of my interests, and I admit it's relaxing to have somebody to talk to about these things. I sometimes wonder whether my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] was right... Am I destined for these matters?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_A;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Turning my eyes upwards, I give a silent nod to the heavens, thanking the stars for their guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_B;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Turning my eyes upwards, I take a deep breath. Perhaps the influence of the stars are unavoidable. May be that [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]'s destiny is out of my control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_C;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]. Sighing, I rub my temples. Perhaps knowing about [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] destiny makes [horoscope_child.GetHerHim] anxious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_D;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing increasingly reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]. I take a deep breath while I contemplate the stars and their influence over us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1270_A;Over the years, I've always felt motivated to study the art of [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Even once I officially finished my education, I did not feel satisfied. "There must be more to this", I urged my educators, and they have indulged me. I am not sure if I have been guided by the stars, as my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] might have put it, but I do feel like I can finally be more than what everyone has assumed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1270_B;Over the years, I've always felt motivated to study the art of [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Even once I officially finished my education, I did not feel satisfied. "There must be more to this", I urged my educators, and they have indulged me. My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] might have had other plans for me, but I feel confident that this is the path the stars laid out before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1270_C;Over the years, I haven't always felt motivated to study the art of [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Yet I did not feel satisfied at all, once I officially finished my education. "I think I made a mistake in neglecting these studies", I urged my educators, and they have indulged me. I am not sure if I have been guided by the stars, as my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] might have put it, but I do feel like I can finally be more than what everyone has assumed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1270_D;Over the years, I haven't always felt motivated to study the art of [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Yet I did not feel satisfied once I finished my education. "I think I made a mistake in neglecting these studies", I urged my educators, and they have indulged me. My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] might have had other plans for me, but perhaps [horoscope_maker.GetHerHis] horoscope was right all along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1271_A;Perhaps it is a blessing that [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] is no longer with us. [horoscope_maker.GetSheHeCap] would have been distraught to see me not living up to my potential, as the great [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] anticipated of me. May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forgive me. It's just not who I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1271_B;I admit that I have perhaps been avoiding my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] lately. [horoscope_maker.GetSheHeCap] is likely disgruntled, or perhaps even disappointed in me, for not living up to my potential as the great [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] long ago predicted that I would become. May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forgive me. It's just not who I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1289;[Root.GetTitledName] is born under the sign of [Root.GetWesternZodiacSign].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1400;I brewed the potion just like the enciphered recipe dictated. Mere seconds after it passed my lips a wave of pleasurable sensations rolled over me! While the peak of my bliss was short-lived, that first rush must have washed away the dispiriting darkness that has plagued me for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1401;'I do not mean to meddle, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], but you do not seem to be well,' says [From.GetTitledFirstName], concern tinting [From.GetHerHis] voice. 'In my studies, I have unveiled a secret to raise low spirits and bring about happiness.' [From.GetSheHeCap] offers me a flask containing an unidentifiable liquid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1402;I brewed the potion just like the enciphered recipe dictated. [From.GetTitledFirstName] gratefully accepted my help and as soon as [From.GetSheHe] drank my concoction, I could see a change in [From.GetHerHim]. Now the light has returned to [From.GetHerHis] eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1403;For a while I felt like nothing could extinguish the renewed sense of joy and purpose I gained after drinking the potion. It seems as if I was mistaken. Life and duty wears one down and I am no exception. There is nothing more, no great secret to uncover. Just toil and anguish, every day until my last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1405;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI must say, dear colleague, I cannot fathom how you get along without a proper assistant! My own is both bright and obedient. Not once have I detected the stench of alcohol upon [hermetic_collaborator.GetHerHisOpp] breath. Take my advice and find an apprentice of your own.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1408;Over the past months, the thought of an apprentice has been at the forefront of my mind. I have considered my advisors, but I dare say not one of them seem fit for the role. However, one of my servants has caught my eye. [apprentice_candidate.GetFirstName] is an attentive [apprentice_candidate.GetManWoman] with steady hands and a good head on [apprentice_candidate.GetHerHis] shoulders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1409;I have a good feeling about this! With [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as my apprentice, I am sure to uncover many a secret. Perhaps I shall event perform the great work, the Magnum opus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1414;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s apprenticeship has reached its end. [From.GetSheHeCap] knows enough of alchemy, astrology and Theurgy to be acknowledged as a hermetic scholar in [From.GetHerHis] own rights. As a parting gift, I gave [From.GetHerHim] a tome containing a few of my most well-guarded secrets. I did not pretend to notice the tears in [From.GetHerHis] eyes, but they touched me deeply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1416_A;I have been struck by a great loss. The death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] has left me without an apprentice and an assistant, as well as a companion. While I already contemplate taking on a new pupil, I shall surely mourn for [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1416_B;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] has left me without an apprentice and an assistant. I shall mourn over [From.GetHerHis] passing, of course, but there was also a hint of relief to my reaction as I was brought the news. Now I can finally take on a proper pupil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1418;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy [Root.GetSisterBrother], I have a proposal which might interest you. An old letter detailing the possible locations of some lost hermetic writings came into my possession not many moons ago. If you fund an expedition, we can search for these treasures together!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1420_A;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe letter mentioned three lost texts: a tome in a local antiquary, a scroll hidden in a [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship] in [temple_site.GetName], and a tablet in the ancient library ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] in [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The further we venture, in distance as well as into the past, the greater secrets we might uncover. The choice is yours.\n\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1420_B;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have the best of news! Since our last correspondence I have acquired a map leading to a surviving chamber of the great library in Alexandria! While the previous options remain â€“ a tome here in [Root.Capital.GetName], a scroll in [temple_site.GetName] and tablet in [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] â€“ I would argue that this opportunity is too great to pass up.\n\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1422;When we found the engraved door to the chamber, we could hardly believe our eyes. [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] and I had nearly given up. That day would be the very last of our search, we had decided, so our discovery must surely have been a divine miracle! My hands were shaking as I, alongside the servants, cleared the last rubble and heaved the door open.\n\nLantern held high over our heads, my colleague and I entered first. The faint light fell on countless pots and chests, elaborate wall paintings and a great forge. Something else reflected the light from deep within the chamber, something vibrantly green... [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName]'s breaths were quick and shallow. 'It.... it cannot be!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1423;Our expedition into foreign lands encountered some difficulties, but in the end we made it to the ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] safely. After a fortnight of excavation the servants uncovered the entrance to a hidden underground chamber. [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] and I entered side by side, the air heavy with excitement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1424;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship]. We examined every nook and cranny for clues of the scroll's hiding place. On the fifth day, one of the servants announced [Root.GetSheHe] had found a hidden chamber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1425;[hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days on end we did nothing but breathe dust and leaf through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! On the fourth day, I was thus incredibly surprised to lay my eyes on the symbols of the Three Primes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_A;My misgivings arose early after our arrival in Alexandria, but [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] insisted that we must have misinterpreted the map. After every failure, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSheHe] had a new idea. A suspicion crept upon me... What if the map was forged, and [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] knew? Was the blasted expedition a plot to ruin me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_B;Our expedition into foreign lands certainly encountered its fair share of difficulties. We dealt with everything from unfavorable weather to lame horses, but in the end, the fraudulent guide was the nail in the coffin. When [Root.GetSheHe] escaped with our last gold, we also discovered that we were in the wrong part of [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_C;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship]. We examined every nook and cranny for clues of the scroll's hiding place. After a week of nothing more interesting than the discovery of a stash of lewd letters, we had to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_D;[hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days at end we did nothing but breathe dust and page through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! After a week, we had to admit defeat. We would never uncover anything of worth in this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_A;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a pompous, featherbrained scoundrel â€“ you know it to be true, [Root.GetSisterBrother]! It is time for [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] to pay for [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] sins. Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_B;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy friend, we have a common nemesis. You know of whom I speak â€“ the despicable idiot [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]! The thought of [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] being a member of our respectable community... it makes me sick! Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_C;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a greedy, slothful idiot who deserves none of the riches in [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] possession. What do you say, [Root.GetSisterBrother] â€“ shall we raid [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and claim that which should be ours?\n\nAs above, so below.\n\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1433;Most esteemed [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYet my spies have not found the exact location of [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory. You need not worry, friend, for they have some promising leads. We will just have to be patient.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_A;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] must be paranoid, for [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory is a fortress hidden away on a remote island. As we cross the dark waters under the cover of night, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] tells me about the guard rotation. We will only have one chance to breach the defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_B;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] has hidden [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory deep in the dungeons of [infiltration_target.Capital.GetName]. [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I have passed unnoticed so far thanks to the intelligence [infiltration_companion.GetHerHis] spies provided, but the last door is heavily guarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_C;It was not hard to locate [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] tells me as we enter the [infiltration_target.Capital.GetHolding]. 'While old [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] has no talent for keeping secrets, [infiltration_target.GetSheHe] does know how to hire proper guards,' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] continues, telling me about the obstacle ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1436_A;As we step out of the shadows, the guards draw their blades. Their posture and faces change as I pull the heavy purse from my pocket. After a short exchange of words and coins, [infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I enter through the heavy door. 'What now, [Root.GetSisterBrother]? What course of action would you recommend?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1436_B;By some miracle, [infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] manages to empty the little vial of potion in a jug before it is brought to the guards. Within a quarter of an hour, they are snoring softly. 'We must hurry â€“ the sedating effect won't last forever,' I whisper as we sneak past. 'What now, [Root.GetSisterBrother]?' [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] asks once we are inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1437;First, everything went so well. By some miracle, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] managed to empty the little vial of potion in a jug before it was brought to the guards. That was half an hour ago! The guards are showing no signs of drowsiness and our time is running out. I whisper apologies as we leave, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] does not answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1438;I had my doubts, but color me impressed! [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] managed to lure the guards away by setting off an alchemical reaction producing the foulest of odors! While the trick was effective, to say the least, I do not know how much time I have. I need to focus. What should I do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1439;I have seen many foolish things in my days, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]'s poor attempt at a distraction might just take the prize. I am dumbstruck as [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] rattles [infiltration_companion.GetHerHis] blade against the wall and begins to wail loudly! When the guard's footsteps draw near, I grab [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim] and run. 'Really, a ghost? No one in their right mind would fall for that!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_A;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the sleeping potion, they are still faster than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_B;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_C;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the potion, they are still faster than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_D;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_A;Who knew the laboratory of [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] would be such a treasure trove? In addition to some rare ingredients and a few items which will fetch good coin in the shadier parts of [Root.Capital.GetName], I came across a most interesting text!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_B;My search has been most rewarding. [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s ingredient cabinet has a fine assortment of substances and I have found several nuggets of precious metal. My share of the spoils will be a fine addition to my own laboratory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_C;For all [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] talk and boasting, I expected more than this. Or, perhaps, [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is more paranoid than I thought. In any case, I cannot find anything of great value. At least these nuggets of metal will sell for a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_A;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only have my ingredient cabinet and metal collection been pilfered, but my most valued text is gone! My most divine knowledge, my deepest secrets! May the thief rot in hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_B;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only has the thief laid its dirty hands on my precious metals, but my ingredient cabinet has been ransacked also. The culprit must be another follower of the Hermetic arts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_C;I should really look over the security of my lab. Last night, some vile person snuck past the guards, but luckily nothing of major value was stolen. Either the thief had no idea of how valuable my ingredients and tomes are, or they were too dumb to find them. The precious metals will cost a fair bit to replace, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_A;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] gunpowder better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent bomb. Considering the many barrels of volatile substances, this should be enough to ruin the laboratory. I light the fuse and run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_B;Thankfully, a laboratory is not particularly hard to sabotage. The place is full of acids, volatile substances and old tomes dry as bones. While I do not feel confident enough to risk a great fire, I heave the texts into the furnace and set the ablaze!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_C;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] gunpowder better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent bomb. I assemble the parts ever so slowly because my hands will not stop shaking. Just as I am about to perform the last step, I drop a vial. I freeze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_A;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! I woke last night as the whole keep shook violently. It seems like someone entered my laboratory and set off an explosion! Luckily, no lives were harmed, but my laboratory is in ruins. There is nothing to save.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_B;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! It seems as if I have made an enemy, for the intruder focused on destruction rather than theft. Acid has been poured on floors and across work surfaces, pots and glass have been shattered and, worst of all, my furnace is filled with the blackened pages of burnt books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_C;I am not sure whether I should be disturbed or amused! This morning, a charred corpse was discovered in my laboratory. Apparently the crook broke in to sabotage my work but managed to kill [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a botched attempt to craft a bomb. I examined the body and the culprit was none other than [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.Society.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_A;I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] hands deep in a big ingredients chest. Our eyes meet and I nod. It is time to go. [From.GetFirstName] stuff a few more vials and nuggets of metal into [From.GetHerHis] satchel before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_B;I follow the trail of overturned chests and broken vials until I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. I gesture for [From.GetHerHim] to come with me â€“ it is time to go. [From.GetSheHeCap] stuffs [From.GetHerHis] pockets with a few nearby tools before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1448;As I close my satchel, I hear a loud crash from the other room. As I peek through the doorway, the scene before me is impressive. The warm light of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s torch illuminates the destruction. Overturned tables, torn books and smashed instruments. I nod appreciatively. 'It is time to leave.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1449;As I reach for a nearby tome, a terrifying roar sweeps through the laboratory and the floor shudders underneath my feet. Images of dragons and chimeras flash through my mind before the truth hits me. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] must have set of an explosion. There is no time look for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1450;Once we have left the laboratory far behind us, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I collapse, two bundles of sweaty and shivering limbs. We did it. We really did it, and we got away with it, too! As the laugh erupts from my lips, my body finally relaxes. Next to me, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] heavy breathing turns into a merry chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1451;It seems like my guards have caught a couple of ugly fishes! Apparently [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName], along with [From.GetHerHis] accomplice [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName], made an attempt to enter my laboratory and steal my secrets. This insult cannot go unanswered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1452;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed!' After some further insults, [From.GetSheHe] offers me my freedom in exchange for some of my deepest secret knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1453;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. I am sure I could have asked for [From.GetHerHis] firstborn, so eager was [From.GetSheHe] to have [From.GetHerHis] freedom. [From.GetFirstName] filled notebook after notebook under my stern gaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1454;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] cell, however, for when I told [From.GetHerHim] of my generous offer, I got nothing but insults and curses in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1455;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed! I just wanted to have a look at you before they throw away the key...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1460;While I am certainly a great scholar with several fine discoveries to my name, I am not too proud to collaborate with like-minded colleagues. I have contemplated hosting some of my colleagues from [Root.Society.GetName] for an intellectual gathering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1461;The preparations have been completed and the invitations have been sent and accepted. My honored guests are already packing their coffers. Soon our gatherings begins â€“ I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1463;To the esteemed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYet again I must thank you for your generous invitation. A gathering of the great minds, such a fine idea! However, I have one small suggestion. I would be delighted if you invited [great_minds_guest_4.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_4.GetFirstName]. [great_minds_guest_4.GetHerHisCap] indisputable brilliance would be a fine addition to our gathering!\n\nSigned, [great_minds_guest_3.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_3.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1464;Finally, my guests are here! After a pleasant dinner we have retired to my study. During the coming weeks, my guests and I have agreed to work on a common project. Our joined ingenuity shall bring about a brilliant new invention! The time has come for me to reveal the direction for our enterprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1466;As I look around the table, I notice the displeased expression of [great_minds_dissenter.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_dissenter.GetFirstName]. Our eyes lock for a few seconds and then, defiantly, [great_minds_dissenter.GetSheHe] stands up. 'Really, [Root.GetHermeticInvention]? I am sorry to say, but your suggestion seems... stale. Unoriginal. I suggest we should give our project a [great_minds_dissenter.GetHermeticInvention] focus.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1467;As I look around the table, everyone nods in agreement. 'A fine suggestion, dear [Root.GetSisterBrother],' [great_minds_guest_1.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] exclaims, a wide smile on [great_minds_guest_1.GetHerHis] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFaceDescription] face. 'Tomorrow, we shall begin to work on the project the first thing after sunrise.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1468;As I suspected, [great_minds_dissenter.GetFirstName]'s arguments are thin and flimsy. As we debate, it becomes clear to one and all that [great_minds_dissenter.GetHerHis] suggestion was born out of spite and an unfounded sense of self-importance. In the end, [great_minds_dissenter.GetSheHe] is forced to concede.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1469;While my idea is clearly better, my arguments seem to fail me. The others do not seem convinced by them, at least. [great_minds_dissenter.GetFirstName], on the other hand, proves [great_minds_dissenter.GetHerselfHimself] as a true master of manipulation! Within a quarter of an hour, I must admit myself defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1470;As I enter the laboratory one morning, I am met by agitated voices. [great_minds_guest_1.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] and [great_minds_guest_2.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName] are gesturing wildly over a set of sketches. They are disagreeing on the direction of the project. [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] argues for a riskier, but potentially more rewarding route, while [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName] wants to play it safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1471;I am trying to focus on my working, but it is becoming increasingly difficult! [arguer_1.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_1.GetFirstName] and [arguer_2.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_2.GetFirstName] will never agree on anything. If one says one thing, the other must immediately disagree. Sometimes I cannot help but wonder if they are both possessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1472;While my first calm attempts did not make much of a difference, my angry outburst suddenly did. The violent reaction finally brought [arguer_1.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_1.GetFirstName] and [arguer_2.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_2.GetFirstName] to their senses. Now, a few hours later, they approach me to apologize for their petty and lowbrow bickering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1473;Calmly, I try to explain the unreasonable nature of their bickering, and how their constant negativity is disruptive to our project. Regrettably, my words seem to have no impact. Actually, I might just have made it worse. 'Do you hear that, [arguer_1.GetFirstName]? You are being disruptive,' [arguer_2.GetFirstName] sneers. And there they go again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1475;[great_minds_agreer.GetFirstName] taps the detail on the sketches in front of us and I nod enthusiastically. 'I agree, [great_minds_agreer.GetFirstName]! Surely moving the axis over here would make the mechanism much less prone to error.' During the last few days, [great_minds_agreer.GetFirstName] and I have worked so well together. I am so glad [great_minds_agreer.GetSheHe] came!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1476;The sun set hours ago and I can barely distinguish the details of the sketches in front of me. Everyone else has gone to bed, but I am wide awake. The thoughts are spinning in my head, faster and faster. There is something there, just outside of the boundaries of consciousness. I almost have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_A;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! Our accomplishment is twofold â€“ not only have we perfected the recipe for an explosive powder, we have also designed and produced a device which can launch small metal balls at lethal speeds. This 'handgun' is sure to revolutionize warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_B;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! We have invented a device which always points towards the lodestar of the north, making it possible to navigate even when the celestial bodies are obscured by clouds. It will surely give an advantage to our traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_C;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! We have designed and constructed an ingenious device to measure angles in the sky. We call it the 'radius astronomicus'. My charts of the stars will become infinitely better and easier to maintain thanks to our invention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_D;The hour has finally arrived. Today we test our invention! Together we have devised a huge crossbow which launches large stones. While the weapon is certainly deadly, it is also incredibly intimidating. I will have one mounted on the walls of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_E;Together my colleagues and I have constructed a huge furnace of a truly ingenious design! It can produce metals in streams so steady and vast that no other method can even hope to rival it. This efficient new invention will make sure we have trading goods and building materials of the highest quality available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_F;The invention is finished! Together we have created our own secret code as well as an instrument to aid in enciphering and deciphering. The idea behind the device might seem simple, but the best one always do. Our cipher disc is quite ingenious, really. Now our secrets will be safe â€“ at least if all of us can be trusted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_G;Our invention has been completed. While it is not a weapon, it will offer protection from them. It is a set of armor consisting of several big plates of metal instead of the common mail. The design we have arrived at also allows for impressive mobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_H;Many mills dot the landscape around [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] and are vital for the production of food. It is always a good idea to improve on essential constructions, so during the last we weeks we have made several ingenious improvements to old designs. Our new mill is safer as well as more efficient than ever before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_I;For weeks we struggled to create a lens with new and revolutionary properties, and while we failed to achieve this goal, we came to another realization. What if we took a lens we already had, but changed how we used it, instead? Based on my reading stone, we came up with a new device, the 'spectacles'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1479_A;We have had several ideas which were clever but impractical, and a heap more which were just ludicrous. The lack of progress has made everyone tired and irritable. Tonight, at dinner, I finally ended it. We all knew it was the right thing to do. Rest was something none of us had known in weeks, and our other obligations had gone unattended for too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1479_B;We were making such good progress, but now, all is lost! We can never be sure who set of the explosion. Does it really matter? Even if we knew, the disaster could never be undone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1481;My colleagues have approached me â€“ apparently they have been talking behind my back. They are dissatisfied by the gathering and how it has been managed, and has decided that they will be leaving. 'This venture has no potential, [Root.GetFirstName],' one of them says, in a tone probably meant to be kind. To me, it sounds condescending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1600;Over the past few months I have developed an elaborate cypher that I will use to encode my life's work. However, before I can continue I must decide upon a direction in which to take my Opus, as the sum of all my knowledge is simply too great to be recorded in a single book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1601;I have made ample headway in recording my knowledge on the subject of Theurgy, but it is still too vast to touch upon everything. It will be necessary to narrow the focus of my efforts even further, and to write on only one of Theurgy's aspects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1602;I have made ample headway in recording my knowledge on the subject of the stars and planets, but it is still too vast to touch upon all that makes up Astrology. It will be necessary to narrow the focus of my efforts even further, and to write on only one of Astrology's aspects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1603;I have made ample headway in recording my knowledge on the subject of transmutation and panacea, but it is still too vast to touch upon all that makes up Alchemy. It will be necessary to narrow the focus of my efforts even further, and to write on only one of Alchemy's aspects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1604;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on ritualistic Theurgy. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1605;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on contemplative Theurgy. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1606;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on stellar Astrology. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1607;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on planetary Astrology. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1608;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on alchemical Universal Panacea. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1609;It is done! It is finished! After a year of sweat and toil I have managed to produce a grand work on transmutative Alchemy. This tome shall stand the test of ages, ensuring my knowledge and name shall conquer time, itself. It will serve my successors well, and perhaps they will one day be able to add their knowledge to mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1610;Secluded at my writing desk, quill in hand and plenty a bottle of ink nearby, I find myself staring down upon the blank parchment. The sheer scale of the task upon which I am about to embark dawns upon me â€“ I need to record my knowledge, but also hide it from those who are unworthy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1622;My [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetSisterBrother] in the Hermetic Order, [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetFirstName], has stepped forth with an idea for a ritual that might invoke the presence of a Divine Being. The prospect of petitioning the Divine itself for knowledge is tantalizing, and the idea was therefore received with excitement in the Order. The ritual will take place in a few weeks' time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1622_COURT;My dear [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetRootRelation] and [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetSisterBrother] in the Hermetic Order, [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetFirstName], has stepped forth with an idea for a ritual that might invoke the presence of a Divine Being. The prospect of petitioning the Divine itself for knowledge is tantalizing, and the idea was therefore received with excitement by the Order. The ritual will take place in a few weeks' time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1624;The time for the ritual has come, and your Order has congregated in a spacious room. Symbols scatter the floor as you chant your hymns. [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetFirstName] has provided you all with a new, special type of incense that [divine_summoning_collaborator.GetSheHe] claims is necessary to make the eventual connection with the Divine Being. Before long it has permeated the air, and as you inhale more and more of it, hearing the drone of your fellows' chants, you feel your soul disconnect from your body and begin to ascend...\n\n...until it seems to connect with something. An... entity touches your soul, though you cannot perceive it with any senses other than your mind's eye. It must be the Divine Being! You have succeeded! You struggle to control your emotions, and to coalesce all your thoughts into one burning question that you pose to this being...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_ALCH_BONUS;The Divine Being has given me cryptic advice on the pursuit of alchemy in its many forms, but with ample time spent mulling it over afterwards, I believe I have deciphered what it meant. I look forward to putting it to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_ASTR_BONUS;The Divine Being has given me cryptic advice on the pursuit of astrology in its many forms, but with ample time spent mulling it over afterwards, I believe I have deciphered what it meant. I look forward to putting it to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_FAILURE;The Divine Being gave me a cryptic reply to my question, and for many days since the ritual I have tried to make sense of it... Yet, no matter how much time I spend on it, I cannot. Whatever the Being intended for me to know is beyond my capacity to understand â€“ I can only conclude I simply am not worthy of its knowledge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_MIND_BONUS;The Divine Being has given me cryptic advice on the pursuit of Theurgy in its many forms, but with ample time spent mulling it over afterwards, I believe I have deciphered what it meant. I look forward to putting it to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_SUCCESS;In my trance, the Divine Being tells me of great Truths that have been hidden from Man â€“ of alchemy and astrology, of the will of the gods, of the cyphers to ancient texts, and even of things that have not yet come to pass. Once my soul returns to my body, I see the world with new eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1626_TRUTH_BONUS;The Divine Being has given me cryptic advice on the decryption of hidden secrets throughout the world, but with ample time spent mulling it over afterwards, I believe I have deciphered what it meant. I look forward to putting it to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1630;I face the daunting task of researching and writing an entire theorem paper, to be reviewed by my peers... To have it be accepted by the Order would be a great boon to me, but if the quality is found to be lacking it might be a big blow to my prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1642;Esteemed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nHaving spent ample time considering your paper's worth, I have decided to endorse your work before the Order. I hope that it shall speedily be added to our library. Well done!\n\nRespectful greetings,\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1643;Esteemed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nHaving spent ample time considering your paper's worth, I have decided NOT to endorse your work before the Order. In my view, the quality of the work was unfortunately not in keeping with the standards of our library.\n\nRespectful greetings,\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1646;Drat! That nosy [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] has somehow discovered that I borrowed elements from other authors... [From.GetSheHeCap] has already spread the word, slandering me before the Order and ensuring my paper will never be accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1800_A;I have called upon my apprentice, [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] to help me gather ingredients that are needed for further studies of the mysteries in the world. But first I need to decide what kind of ingredients we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1800_B;[gathering_companion.GetSocietyRank] [gathering_companion.GetFirstName] has offered [gathering_companion.GetHerHis] help with gathering much needed ingredients for further studies of the mysteries in the world. But first I need to decide what kind of ingredients we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1802;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy [Root.GetSisterBrother], as you know we're always in need of more ingredients to perform our experiments. These experiments are essential to uncover the mysteries of the world. I propose a joint venture to combine our knowledge in an effort to identify and gather ingredients so that our search for truth will not be halted by such worldly things as material shortages.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1810;[gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I arrived in the hills early in the morning to collect various useful herbs that we could find in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1812_A;[gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] is most resourceful. While discussing the different aspects of the elements we identify a plethora of plants by tasting and smelling them and the days pass without us even noticing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1812_B;We have now spent days looking high and low for useful herbs. With both me and [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] exhausted we are forced to conclude that the small assortment of interesting plants is what we are getting out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1812_C;My mouth is feeling funny and numb after [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] got me to taste a weird looking plant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1815;Together with a small band of hunters [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I have set out to hunt animals in the forest in an attempt to gather animal parts. These ingredients will be invaluable in experiments to understanding the aspects of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1817_A;With the help of [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] tracking the animals of the forest they now have nowhere to hide. It almost feels too easy now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1817_B;The forest is full of wild animals. Even though they are delusive creatures our cunning is more than enough to find their hiding places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1817_C;As I was nocking an arrow, carefully studying my prey on the other side of the shaft, suddenly [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] starts shouting and screaming. While I'm glaring angrily at [gathering_companion.GetHerHim] and the game runs tauntingly its way, [gathering_companion.GetFirstName] tries to explain [gathering_companion.GetHerselfHimself].\n"The sun-rays weren't hitting the glade and thus the organs would've been useless!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1820;The stalls around us are brimming with all different kinds of goods and people are swarming around us. [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I look each other in the eyes nodding. We know that we will need to be thorough in our search and excellent in our haggling if we want to make some good deals here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1822_A;Slipping by the stalls nearly every single one of them has an interesting item. I merely poke [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] to make [gathering_companion.GetHerHim] aware of it and [gathering_companion.GetSheHe] puts on the smooth-talking. After [gathering_companion.GetHerHis] haggling people almost end up giving us the items for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1822_B;Navigating the different scenes and smells of the town square at this hour can be confusing. Still I managed to find some good quality ingredients at a decent price as did [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1822_C;No matter how hard we looked there never seemed to be anything interesting. Somehow I still ended up with my bags full of useless junk that someone sold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1829;To [Root.GetCollaboratorHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nDear colleague, I have found the most fascinating phenomena from observing the sky. I am of the firmest belief that the foundation of the cosmos is hiding somewhere out there. In order to reach higher knowledge, you should take my advice and study the skies thoroughly.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1830;The instruments and tomes that I had to gather for my studies of the secrets behind the stars have finally arrived. Lenses of different shapes and sizes, together with dusty old tomes written by learned people â€“ these will prove invaluable for uncovering the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1840;This has certainly been a very productive evening. I have been able to dedicate all of my thinking to calculate the patterns of the different objects in the sky uninterrupted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1843;Making sure that land owners and traders are paying their taxes in a timely fashion is a time-consuming task. Lately, my mind has been more occupied with the task of making sure that the stars are in their correct place, rather than that the taxes are in my coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1844;[target_friend.GetTitledFirstName] has been very cold to me lately. When I approach [target_friend.GetHerHim] about it today, [target_friend.GetSheHe] asks me point blank where I was. "Was when?", I respond. "We had plans to visit my uncle? The one who likes fishing? I knew you weren't all that excited, but I didn't expect you to simply not show up", [target_friend.GetSheHe] mutters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1845;While in a meeting with my council, I feel a headache rising inside my skull, making it hard to pick up the different conversations in the room. Lack of sleep is clearly taking its toll on me. Shouting erupts in the room â€“ suddenly [councillor1.GetTitledFirstName] shouts my name, bringing my consciousness back to the room. In a threatening tone, [councillor1.GetSheHe] asks if I agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1846;My careful observations of [This.GetRandomPlanetName] has finally allowed me to conclude that the old projections of the planets path across the sky have been flawed. With some precise adjustments I can present a corrected projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1847;It is an early morning when I, with shaking hand, put my quill down... Is it possible? Have I predicted the traveling of a star-fall? Wiping my brow, I go over my calculations once more â€“ I get the same results, again. It does seem to add up! I lean back in my chair â€“ judging from all the signs, I am fairly certain I know when this marvel will take place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1848;I find myself almost buried under an enormous heap of documents occupying my work desk which I have carefully studied. Yet there is still an absence of any observation about the specific light in the sky between two well-known star formations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1850;It is rare to have a completely clear night-sky to observe, yet tonight the weather conditions are perfect. I smile, as I begin to carefully note down the pattern of the celestial bodies. I feel a surge of energy â€“ never have I had such a spectacular view of my own constellation, [Root.GetWesternZodiacSign] â€“ I can sense my connection to the elements stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1851;On a dark sheet there lies bright dots scattered around, dancing in a random fashion. No matter how long time I spend staring into the sky, no pattern reveals itself for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1852;[From.GetBestName] has not only discovered a new bright star in the sky, [From.GetSheHe] has decided to give me the honor of having the sparkling star named after myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1855;While pondering my current studies, it occurs to me that I have several items in my possession that could be experimented with in order to enhance my understanding of the heavens...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1900;I have been with the Hermetics for some time and yet, I have not been able to contemplate enough on all of the three arts. If I were to focus on one of the arts I might further increase my understanding of it. But which art should I choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1902;There are many ways in how one may reveal the secrets behind the movement of stars and celestial bodies. I could set up the needed equipment to study them myself. Alternatively, I could look at the existing research of known authors and researchers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1903;Standing outside and gazing upon the night sky is invigorating! I have yet to fully grasp the secrets hidden from me. Knowing that I can find the meaning behind the stars, I refuse to give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1904;To master the art of alchemy is not an easy task. It may take years before I can make any notable progress. I must decide how best to pursue this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1905;Alchemy is the key component of uncovering the truth, that much I know. But I still have much to learn and discover. Dedication and resolve will be my allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1906;One way to better understand [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is the use of white magic, in which you pray to divine spirits in order to use their guidance. This is known as Theurgy. Another path is that of Goetia. To use black magic by seeking out foul demons and heeding their advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1907;Divine enlightenment is not something you easily achieve. Even if I have made some progress already, it has been slow and I have merely scratched the surface. How will I ever learn the truth at this pace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1920;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI write to you with a proposition. We are both esteemed members of [Root.Society.GetName] and I think we could learn much from one another. I hereby invite you to a night of discoveries and to study the sky.\n\nYour fellow [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank], [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1921;To the [GetFromFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYour invitation arrived as a very pleasant surprise. I would be honored to study with you and will prepare my journey shortly.\n\nYour fellow [From.GetSocietyRank], [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1922;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI received your invitation, but I fear that I will have to decline. It is currently impossible for me to make any travel arrangement on such a short notice. I hope you understand.\n\nYour fellow [From.GetSocietyRank], [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1926;It seems that more important matters have been brought to me. I will have to cancel the invitation I sent to [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName]. The night of studies and stargazing will have to wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1927;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI fear that urgent matters require my attention for now. We will have to perform our planned studies of the night sky at another time. I pray that you will not be too disappointed.\n\n[From.GetSocietyRank], [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1928;My guest [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] has finally arrived. I have been looking forward to the two of us getting together and review the work of each other. There is still some time before nightfall, however. I have a few suggestion of how we could spend the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1930;When arriving in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName] I was greeted with a smile from [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName]. I quickly unpacked but I could tell that [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] was eagerly waiting for me. 'I would like to show you my observatory', [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] said as [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] was turning to lead the way. Once inside, carefully crafted tools and lenses could be seen everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1931;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] the way to the observatory. When we stepped inside, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] gazed in wonder at the various tools. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] went on to ask about the different instruments and how to use them. At which times you are more likely to see the stars more clearly. The questions kept coming for quite a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1932;I lead [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the observatory and waited for [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] reaction when we stepped inside. At first [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only looked around. After a while [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] asked a few simple question but I got the feeling that it was not very impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1933;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] greeted me when I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. After a short conversation [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] lead the way to [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] study. When we stepped inside I immediately noticed all the tools and lenses. It would seem that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] owns quite a collection of stargazing equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1934;I guided [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the study to showcase my stargazing tools. I could see that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was delighted as [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] spent quite some time inspecting them. We talked about the tools for quite a while. We even had a long conversation just about lenses. Small lenses and larger lenses, and knowing when to use which ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1935;I arrived at the study with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] closely behind me. 'This is the equipment I have obtained', I explained and gestured towards the neatly ordered collection of tools. [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] inspected the collection for a moment, but did not look very impressed. Or at least as something [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] has seen before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1936;Upon my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName], I was received with great splendor. [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] explained that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] had chosen a perfect location to use during the night. 'This way and I will show it to you.' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] lead the way to a hill not too far away. The hill had a decent height for its small size and no trees obscuring the view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1937;We walked to the hill of my choice not far away. Once there, [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] took a moment to look at the hill and the sky above. 'This hill should suit our needs perfectly I think.' [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] said while nodding approvingly. We quickly decided on where to set up in order to be able to see as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1938;I walked with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the nearby hill I had chosen for us. While pointing to a few places that I think would work well for us, I hear [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] complaining behind me. Clearly disapproved of my choice. 'I suppose it will do. But it seems to be very far away if you ask me.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1939;When I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName] I was not only met with a warm smile from [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], but a grand feast as well! A wide range of courses had been prepared for our pleasure and indulgence. [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] raised a cup in my honor. 'Let us toast for a night of new discoveries!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1940;When [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] entered the dining hall, I think the feast came as a surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. We dined and enjoyed ourselves and had a good time just speaking with each other for the next few hours. 'You have outdone yourself, [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]. This was spectacular!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1941;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the dining hall and the awaiting feast. The look on [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] face made it abundantly clear that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was not expecting a proper feast. Perhaps [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was expecting a small dinner? Did I overdo it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1942;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was there to welcome me on my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. Shortly thereafter we made the way to [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]'s private study, where [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] began to show me his current work and most recent discoveries. 'How better to pass the time before nightfall than to spend it on studies and learning?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1943;Knowing that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] is a learned man I showed him to my study. After discussing my most recently acquired writings I suggested that we sit down and try to learn something from them. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] responded with approval. 'I would never say no to an opportunity of gathering newfound knowledge. That is after all, the reason I am here.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1944;Thinking that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] would jump at the chance of examining my most recently acquired writings, I showed [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim] my collection. After a moment of glancing through the pages, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] casually put the writings back in their place. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then suggested that we rest before the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1945;Night is almost upon us and the first stars are finally making themselves visible on the sky outside. I should tell [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] that it is time. Time to see if we can uncover new secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and me have been looking at the stars for a few hours already. Suddenly, it occurred to me. Stars are aligned in different patterns, taking on the shapes of different figures. But they are not really moving, are they? They always seem to have the same location in relation to one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1948;I was reading through our notes when [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly shouted at me. '[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! It just occurred to me!' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] then went on explaining [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] theory about how the stars never move and how they are related to one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1950;I was writing down some notes when I heard [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] speak behind me and turned to face [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then went on to explain a theory of how the zodiacs are connected with each other how they are aligned in a certain way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1951;When looking at the stars and the patterns they create on the sky, I started thinking on the zodiacs. I quickly explained my newfound theory to [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] who nodded in agreement. The zodiacs are sure to be hiding secrets waiting to be unveiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1953;After several hours of studying the stars, I saw it. A sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. I called for [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to get [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] attention. We both marveled at the beauty of it for a while. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] said after a moment of silence. I could only nod my head in agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1954;After several hours of studying the stars, we noticed a sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. Both me and [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] marveled at the beauty of it. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] nodded slowly in response. 'It is. But it is hardly an omen of the end times like the peasants would make you believe.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1955;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and I have been taking turns in making observations and recording everything. I cannot say that we have made any significant discoveries so far. We have made some progress, however, and learned a few things we did not know before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1957;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. Neither [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] nor I has made any noticeable progress so far. With most of the night gone already, it is unlikely that we will accomplish much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1958;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. But neither of us has been able to make any significant progress. Which is disappointing, to say the least. But I can see that my host, [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], is more disappointed than I am. [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] probably had very high hopes for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1959;The sky was filled with ominously dark clouds already when we started our observations. As the hours drags on, it is only getting worse. You cannot see anything by now! Not a single star in sight! I suppose we might as well call it a night right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1962;After spending to night together with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName], I feel like we have become quite close. We seem to complement each other perfectly and the both of us are having a really good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1963;Accepting the invitation to come here and spend the night studying with [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was the correct decision. I have not had this much fun talking to someone in quite a while. We seem to understand each other perfectly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1965;This night seem to never end. I am wondering why I even invited [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] in the first place. Nothing I have done so far seem to please [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. Whenever I try to start a conversation to lighten the mood, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only answer with an obnoxious remark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1966;I should just have thrown away [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] invitation the moment it arrived. This night has been nothing short of horrible. Listening to [stargazing_host.GetHerHim] hurling one insult after the other. One might be thinking if that is the reason why [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] invited me here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_A;Dawn is upon us as the first light appears on the horizon. I think we can agree that the night was an immense success. We took plenty of notes and learned a thing or two. Maybe we will have an opportunity to continue our combined research in the future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_B;An exhausting night finally ends. We worked throughout the entire night without any sort of noticeable progress at all. While it feels disappointing, I am confident that continued observations will yield superior results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_C;Time really do fly when you are having fun. We did not make any sort of noticeable progress in our attempted research. But the night was spent in good company, making it feel much less of a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5109_child;I am told that I have recently come into possession of 'alchemical ingredients'. While I am not certain what that means, the [GetSelectedIngredient_1] [GetSelectedIngredient_1_property].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5109_hermetic;I have recently come into possession of several alchemical ingredients. As a member of the Hermetic Order, I suppose I should do some sort of inventory... Regardless, the [GetSelectedIngredient_1] [GetSelectedIngredient_1_property].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5109_no_society;I have recently come into possession of some manner of alchemical ingredients. While I admit I'm intrigued, the [GetSelectedIngredient_1] [GetSelectedIngredient_1_property].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5109_other_society;I have recently come into possession of some manner of 'alchemical' ingredients. I am not entirely sure what to make of it! Regardless, the [GetSelectedIngredient_1] [GetSelectedIngredient_1_property].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5110;My fellow members of the Order sometimes speak of intricate charms and recipes to ward off evil, and perhaps I should take precautions too. Considering the stars of the [GetWesternZodiacSign], I nod to myself â€“ the [GetSelectedIngredient_1] on my shelves [GetSelectedIngredient_1_property].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_MNM_1644;Success! Enough peers have endorsed my paper, and so the Order has accepted it into its library. As a result, my standing with the Order has increased measurably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1645;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s paper that I endorsed recently has now been approved for publishing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1837;After many a night observing the skies I have become certain that there is a lot going on up there, behind the clouds. However, I am considering putting this endeavor to rest, for the sake of my other duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1841;My [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] expressed a curious notion, over supper this evening. "I miss your conversation, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [target_spouse.GetFirstName] said, taking another sip of [target_spouse.GetHerHis] drink. "It's all astronomical phenomenon with you these days...! Surely, you could take some nights off from your research?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1842;I am in the middle of adjusting my new sextant, having just spotted what looked like a shooting star, when there is a faint knock on my door. Opening it, I find my [target_child.GetSonDaughter] [target_child.GetFirstName] fidgeting nervously. Hesitantly, [target_child.GetSheHe] speaks: "[Root.GetFatherMother]? I... I can't sleep.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1853;The air is crisp and the sky clear, as people huddle around each other to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise. As the hour begins to slip away, I hear their skeptical mumbling. Then, suddenly, several "Oooh!" and "Aaah!" take place around me, as people excitedly start pointing upwards. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1854;The sky is pitch black and clear as I make my way up the hill. Carrying my instruments, I have a good feeling about my calculations â€“ tonight is the night. I begin to unpack, and I am in the middle of adjusting my lenses, when I realize that the star-fall is visible even without my tools. I gasp, my chest filling with jubilant glee. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1901;As a scholar, I have dedicated much time to the art of studying the stars and celestial bodies. I learned a great deal in doing so. But I should spend more time with the other arts as well. Which one should I focus on more closely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_MNM_1644;Failure... The majority of the peers refuted my paper, and so it shall not be added to the Order's library. This is a humiliating blow, and it will take some time to recover my previous standing with the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1645;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s paper that I endorsed recently has unfortunately not been approved for publishing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1837;After many a night observing the skies I have become certain that there is a pattern to the movement of celestial bodies that I have yet to uncover. However, I am considering putting this endeavor to rest, for the sake of my other duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1841;Dining with my [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife], the topic of my research came up again. I told [target_spouse.GetHerHim] that I of course regret any ill feelings [target_spouse.GetSheHe] might be experiencing from it, but that I am doing important work. "Honestly, I grow weary of defending myself!", I snapped in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1853;The air is crisp, as people gather together at top of the hill, to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise, and I am beginning to worry. Even if I am right, chances are the star-fall won't be visible tonight, as the weather is particularly cloudy. As the moments pass, one person leaves, and I hear people mumbling. The night grows colder. Eventually, I am left alone on the hill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1854;I have been camped out on the hill for hours, hoping against hope. Maybe I missed it? Maybe my instruments are too weak? I wait even longer, but eventually it dawns on me â€“ I was wrong. I am not sure how, but there is no star-fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1901;To study alchemy and how to reach spiritual transformation is indeed a learning experience. Albeit more difficult than one might imagine. But time has come to also master the other arts. Which one should be my focus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCC_MNM_1837;After many a night observing the skies I have started charting the patterns of stars, as well as the movement of certain planets. There is so much to learn! However, my council won't stop complaining about my absence from the court. Perhaps it is time I conclude my research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_MNM_1901;I have attained great knowledge in the art of Theurgy. Learning about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and divine spirits. Yet, to master the truth and understand it, I will need to learn more about the other arts. Which one should I study next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_1253_TT;In line with [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] destiny, you believe Â§Y[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! will make great use of this talent.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1254;Perhaps a [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] is what I am meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1255;I believe the heavens have a plan for [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1255_TT;You wonder what the future will bring.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1270;I did not even realize that I had it in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1271;I always had mixed feelings about all of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1400;I feel different. Lighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1401;I am willing to give it a try, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1401_TT;Drink the potion. Â§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! has assured you there will be no side effects...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1402;I am glad I could be of assistance, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1403;It was too good to be true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1408;[From.GetSheHeCap] knows how to obey, at the very least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1409;Bright times are ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1414;Best of luck in your studies, [From.GetSocietyRank]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1416;Go to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1420;Excellent indeed! We shall go to Alexandria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1420_TT;You and Â§Y[hermetic_collaborator.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! set off on an expedition to Alexandria, hoping to find the ruins of the Great Library.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1422;Finally, the deepest secrets of Hermes Trismegistus shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1423;Do my eyes deceive me, or are those symbols hieroglyphs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1424;We found it, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1425;I think I found the tome, [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1433;I shall prepare for a swift departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1433_TT;As soon as the spies of Â§Y[infiltration_companion.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! has located the laboratory, you will depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1435;I have a way with people and a heavy purse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1435_TT;Attempt to bribe the guards.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1436;If you focus on destruction, I will search for items of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1436_TT;You split up to cover more ground. Effective, but riskier.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1437;That recipe never failed me before, I swear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1438;I shall steal [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s rarest ingredients and most secret tomes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1439;There will be no second attempt tonight. Not in a long, long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1440;Release me! I'm a colleague of your [infiltration_target.GetMasterMistress]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1441;An excellent find! Praise Hermes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1441_steal_ingredient;You steal a hermetic ingredient. It will be added to your treasury.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1441_steal_text;You steal a great hermetic text. It will be added to your treasury.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1443;Excellent! It will take [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] months, if not years, to recover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1446;So, what is my share of the spoils?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1448;I wish I could see [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s face when [infiltration_target.GetSheHe] realizes what we've done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1449;No one could have slept through that. I have to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1450;We really showed [infiltration_target.GetHerHim], didn't we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1451;Perhaps [From.GetFirstName] is willing to trade a few secrets for [From.GetHerHis] freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1451_FAIL_TT;Â§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! refuses to share [From.GetHerHis] secrets and stays imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1452;Give me some water and then I will tell you whatever you wish to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1453;This will be an interesting read, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1454;Enjoy your beloved cell, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1455;Mercy, mercy! I can't return to that place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1460;It is time. I shall invite some of my favored colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1460_TT;You begin to prepare for the intellectual gathering in Â§Y[Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]Â§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1461;Our work shall be a great tribute to Hermes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1463;If you insist, [great_minds_guest_3.GetSisterBrother]. [great_minds_guest_4.GetSheHeCap] may come along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1463_TT;Â§Y[great_minds_guest_4.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! is also invited to the gathering.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1464;Nothing is deadlier than a sharp mind. Let us invent a machine of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1464_TT;Suggest a project with a warfare focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1466;You have overlooked an essential point, [great_minds_dissenter.GetSocietyRank]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1466_FAILURE_TT;you losing the debate.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1466_SUCCESS_TT;you winning the debate.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1466_TT;Engage Â§Y[great_minds_dissenter.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! in a debate.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1467;I am glad we are of one mind, honored colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1467_TT;Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [Root.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1468;Now that this minor interruption has been dealt with... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1469;We will do it your way, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1469_TT;Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [great_minds_dissenter.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1470;I agree with [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName]. Better to be safe than sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1470_TT;You go with the safe option.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471;Listen to me, friends. Surely, this thing between you is simply a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_FAIL_TT;your efforts making the problem worse.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_SUCCESS_TT;your efforts being successful.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_TT;You try to help Â§Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! and Â§Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! to make up.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1472;What a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1472_TT;The arguments are over and everyone can continue their work without interruptions.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1473;This can never go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1473_TT;The arguments between Â§Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! and Â§Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! are now worse than ever.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1475;Your input is truly appreciated, [great_minds_agreer.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1476;Eureka!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1476_TT;You have an epiphany which will greatly contribute to the project.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1478;The enemy will fear to meet me on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1479;Maybe we will have better luck next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1479_TT;You and your guest fail to invent something useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1481;You're not my prisoners. Leave, if that is your wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1481_TT;The gathering is over. It ended unsuccessfully.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1600;Focus my efforts on writing on Theurgy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1600_TT;Ascension and union with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] is what future generations must strive for.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1601;I will focus on rituals and invocations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1601_TT;Rituals allow one to invoke the will and presence of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap], a necessary first step if one wishes to ultimately unite with the Divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1602;I will focus on the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1602_TT;The stars hold extensive knowledge, and proper reading of them will bring one closer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1603;I will focus on the Universal Panacea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1603_TT;The Universal Panacea would cure all diseases and allow life eternal, bringing the natural human body to perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1604;"Ascend and be one with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1605;"Open your mind to the Truth of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1606;"[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s Truth is in the stars!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1607;"The Will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] is revealed in the movement of the planets!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1608;"Perfect is the body that is free from disease and age!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1609;"Turn metal into gold, and the soul will follow suit!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1610;It will take a great deal of time and effort, but it will be glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1622;The secrets of the world shall be laid bare to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1622_use_ingredients;I have some interesting flasks that could aid us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1624;Oh Divine, pray tell me of the operation of the Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1626;The Divine Being has my total confidence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1630;I will make a decent effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1630_TT;The risks and rewards may be what they are, you have neither the time nor the resources to make an extraordinaire effort, and will rely on your intelligence rather than on hard work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1640;I will send it out, at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1641;Yes, I endorse it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1643;How dare [From.GetSheHe]! "Not good enough"?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1644;I possess a great mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1645;Wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1800;We will gather herbs in the hills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1810;Our combined knowledge will be useful for identifying the plants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1812;We already have more than we can carry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1815;Our combined hunting experience should make this easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1817;A successful hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1820;Our charismatic touch bring forth the best wares to the lowest prices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1822;How did we end up with so many things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1830;Now I can carefully observe the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1837;No, I have to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1837_TT;You will keep studying the stars, increasing your chances of successfully finishing your mission.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1840;Everything is so clear now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1841_1;One does not simply take a break from this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1841_2;Why must we argue about this...?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1842;Go away! I do not have a moment to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1843;What is wealth compared to knowledge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1844;I.. I have had many important things on my mind, lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1845;"Sure, sure...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1846;This will lead me closer to the truth behind the mysteries of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1847;Come the night, I will gather a crowd to witness it with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1848;It shall be named after my beloved child, [target_child.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1850;How exhilarating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1851;There must be something wrong with my instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1852;Do I really deserve this honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1853;This is a night we shall all remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1854;This is what it's all about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1855;I'll burn [GetSelectedIngredient_1] and let the scent flood my senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1900;Astrology and the study of the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1900_TOOLTIP;This art will lead to the Â§YScholarÂ§! trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1901;I shall learn more about astrology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1902;I have to see it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1903;Time will tell if I am worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1904;Learning by doing will lead the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1905;So much to learn. So little time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1906;Only the divine can teach me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1907;I suppose only [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] can deem me worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1920;I would be delighted to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1926;Another time perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1926_TOOLTIP;Cancel the planned night of stargazing and notify [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1928;Have you seen my observatory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1928_TOOLTIP;Show your guest to your observatory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1930;This is truly impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1931;I am glad [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] liked it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1932;Oh well. We are here to study after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1933;Magnificent tools I must say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1934;You may use them later tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1935;At least I like them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1936;This will suit our needs perfectly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1937;It is all about location, location, location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1938;Trust me. It offers a better view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1939;A spectacular feast I must say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1940;The wonders of good food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1941;It tasted good at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1942;That is why I am here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1943;Knowledge is power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1944;I presume the journey was long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1945;We should get ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! Take notes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1948;[stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] could be on to something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1950;Yes. Interesting thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1951;I am certain of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1953;It makes us seem so small.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1954;No it is not. But it is beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1955;The night is not over yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1957;What a disappointing night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1958;So did I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1959;Curse this weather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1962;I have gained a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1963;Thank you my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1965;I cannot wait for you to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1966;I have never been so offended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_A;Let us do this again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_B;Progress takes time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_C;Progress or not. I had a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1969;Time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_5109;I have no use for things like [GetSelectedIngredient_1] and [GetSelectedIngredient_2].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_5110;The [GetSelectedIngredient_1] strategically placed in my quarters should suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_1100;On second thought, there are more pressing matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1101;Let us build an efficient and accessible office for research!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1102;I can work around a small but varied setup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1103;We must only ever buy the most expensive and durable glass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1104;Only the best will be good enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1105;We must import the tools we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1106;My librarians shall not rest until we have such a collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1113;We must really tighten up security...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1114;Why listen to rabble?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1115;We must build a better storage for the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1200;I want to know where my relationships will lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1201;Damnation! This is clearly a bad omen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1202;They will never see me surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1203;Curses! Where is the glory in this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1204;I will be the first to admit I was wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1205;Even a [Root.GetTitle] can be wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1208;I must have misunderstood the vision I had. I will do better next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1209;A heavy price, but I must have misunderstood the vision I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1210;I am glad I was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1211;A heavy price, but I must have misunderstood the vision I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1212;A heavy price, but I must have misunderstood the vision I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1214_cat;Oh, my dear cat. I must strive to understand the visions better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1214_dog;Oh, my dear dog. I must strive to understand the visions better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1214_other;Oh, my darling... I must strive to understand the visions better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1215;I guess I was wrong about the vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1219;I guess I was wrong about the vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1220;I guess I was wrong about it being something positive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1221;I guess I was wrong about it being something positive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1222;I guess I was wrong about it being something negative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1223;I guess I was wrong about it being something negative?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1225_battle;My vision... How could it be so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1225_power;How did I not foresee this event?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1225_relationship;My vision was clearly wrong, but I don't even mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1226_battle;It hurts! And my vision, how could it be so wrong?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1226_power;Superstitious fools! Yet my vision should have warned me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1226_relationship;I will have to deal with [envisioned_rival.GetHerHim] at some point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1251;This is not what I have in mind for [horoscope_child.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1251_TT;You will seek to discourage these tendencies.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1252_1;I wonder what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] saw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1252_2;That certainly takes the pressure off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1253;No! There are many other things I wish [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] would focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1253_TT;You will put efforts into steering Â§Y[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! into another direction in life.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1254;Surely [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] would want me to make my own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1255;Actually, I think the stars have something else in store for my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1255_TT;You doubt the importance of the horoscope you made for Â§Y[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName]Â§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1270;I will keep honing my skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1401;What is that vile concoction? Magic? Only [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] can cure me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1401_TT;Refuse to drink the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1408;Surely I can find someone more worthy than a servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1408_TT;You decide to keep looking for an apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1420;Let us travel to the ruins in [ruin_site.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1420_TT;You and Â§Y[hermetic_collaborator.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! set off on an expedition to [ruin_site.GetName], hoping to find a tablet in the ruins there.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1435;I prepared a potion of dreamless sleep for this very eventuality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1435_single_ingredient;I shall use a simple potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1435_TT;Attempt to drug the guards with a potion of your own making.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1436;Let me take care of sabotage. Collect anything useful you come across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1438;My focus will be maximum destruction. Where is the fire steel...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1444;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] punishes the sinful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1451;Leave them in the dungeon. I will deal with them later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1452;You will never be worthy of my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1452_TT;You stay imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1460;I do not have the time nor the coin to host them right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1463;To be honest, I'd rather not have [great_minds_guest_4.GetFirstName] there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1463_TT;Refuse to invite Â§Y[great_minds_guest_4.GetTitledFirstName]Â§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1464;The aim should be to improve the prosperity of our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1464_TT;Suggest a project with a prosperity focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1466;If you think that would be best, [great_minds_dissenter.GetSisterBrother];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1466_TT;Let Â§Y[great_minds_dissenter.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! have [great_minds_dissenter.GetHerHis] way. Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [great_minds_dissenter.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1470;[great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] is right. We must explore our limits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1470_TT;You go with the riskier, but more innovative option.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1471;Enough! [arguer_1.GetFirstName], pack your coffers and leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1471_TT;Decide that Â§Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! must leave. While the disruptive arguments will be a thing of the past, everyone will remember this failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1478;The sun and stars hold many truths, but so does our compass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1479;This a dark day. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1479_TT;The gathering is over and all progress towards an invention has been lost.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1600;Focus my efforts on writing on Astrology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1600_TT;The movements of the stars and planets will allow your successors to understand the mind of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1601;I will focus on the art of contemplation and meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1601_TT;Contemplation allows one to draw nearer to the mind of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap], and possibly achieve true Understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1602;I will focus on the planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1602_TT;The planets, and their motion through the stars, reveal clues about both the mind of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] as well as the personalities of individuals.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1603;I will focus on transmutation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1603_TT;Transforming metals into gold is a necessary stepping stone towards transforming and perfecting oneself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1622;What if we anger the being? We should not meddle in the divine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1624;Oh Divine, pray tell me of the operation of the stars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1626;It's an epiphany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1630;I will ask help from those around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1630_TT;With the help from some other bright minds you might well stand a better chance at success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1640;No... It's not good enough to be published.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1641;No, it shall not have my endorsement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1644;But... It was good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1645;How did the others not recognize [From.GetHerHis] brilliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1800;In the forest we will hunt for the most prized animal parts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1810;I at least know how to identify some plants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1812;At least we got something out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1815;Let's catch our prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1817;Some of these parts will prove useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1820;Better get started then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1822;You can find the most interesting things here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1837;Yes, enough is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1837_TT;You are satisfied with your progress and will conclude your research, letting your mission come to an end.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1840;I should always strive to be this productive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1841_1;Of course, I will spend more time with you, [target_spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1841_2;You are right, [target_spouse.GetFirstName], I will change my priorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1842;You are too old to be afraid of the dark, [target_child.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1843;Some duties can't be neglected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1844;I understand why you are upset, and I am so sorry, [target_friend.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1845;"I'm sorry, would you care to explain the matter to me again?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1847;I should keep this to myself. Just in case I am wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1848;[target_spouse.GetFirstName], my lovely [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] should have the honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1853;I am humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1854;How could I have been so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1855;I'll make a stew of [GetSelectedIngredient_2]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1900;Alchemy and spiritual transformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1900_TOOLTIP;This art will lead to the Â§YMysticÂ§! trait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1901;Alchemy will be my priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1902;Looking at the work of others is a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1904;Careful studies and observation is key.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1906;There is nothing wrong with demons, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1920;Perhaps another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1928;I will show you my instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1928_TOOLTIP;Show your guest the tools you possess to use for stargazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1930;I fail to see the magnificence really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1933;Anyone can acquire such common items, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1936;A lonely hill in the middle of nowhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1939;Is it not a bit excessive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1942;Even learning is best in moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_5109;These things are bordering heresy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_5110;I will use a combination of elements for this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNM_1101;Let us build a guarded compound on an island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1102;I will require a state of the art laboratory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1200;I want to know what will happen to me as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1202;Not all is lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1253;The stars will always have their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1253_TT;In spite of your initial doubts, you allow Â§Y[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] presumed destiny.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1420;It seems like the best option is the scroll in [temple_site.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1420_TT;You and Â§Y[hermetic_collaborator.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! set off on an expedition to [temple_site.GetName], hoping to find a scroll in a [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship] there.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1435;You distract them, and I will enter the laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1435_TT;Â§Y[infiltration_companion.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! attempts to distract the guards. You will have to perform any theft or sabotage yourself once inside, which limits the amount of damage you may accomplish.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1436;Help me find where [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] keeps [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] valuables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1436_TT;You stay together. Safer, but not as effective.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1441;It is better than nothing, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1443;BOOM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1463;Never! You know what, [great_minds_guest_3.GetFirstName], you are no longer welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1463_TT;Refuse to invite Â§Y[great_minds_guest_4.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! and disinvite Â§Y[great_minds_guest_3.GetTitledFirstName]Â§!. This is sure to cause some raised eyebrows among the other guests...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1466;I am the host and the decision is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1466_TT;You force your own idea. Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [Root.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1471;This cannot continue! Your presence is no longer desired, [arguer_2.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1471_TT;Decide that Â§Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! must leave. While the disruptive arguments will be a thing of the past, everyone will remember this failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1478;The secrets of the heavens shall be unveiled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1600;Focus my efforts on writing on Alchemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1600_TT;Through working with transmutation and healing agents your heirs can transform and perfect themselves.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1624;Oh Divine, pray tell me of the operation of the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1626;Oh, the shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1630;Surely nobody would notice if I copied from some other works?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1630_TT;The findings of other, brighter minds than yourself might well help the quality of your own paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1641;This paper has been blatantly plagiarized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1800;I'm sure we will find useful materials in the marketplace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1810;Which were the poisonous ones again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1812;Let's head home already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1815;I hope someone here knows how to take down a beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1817;That's one way to ruin a hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1820;What can this thing be worth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1822;I feel fooled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1837;I understand so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1840;Studying the vast sky gives me new perspectives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1842_animal_part;Don't fret, child. I'll make you some broth from [GetSelectedIngredient_1].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1842_herb;Calm down, child. I'll brew something with a hint of [GetSelectedIngredient_1].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1842_liquid;Hush, child. I'll make you something, from... Uh, this [GetSelectedIngredient_1].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1842_powder;Hush, child. This [GetSelectedIngredient_1] infused potion will help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1844_animal_part;I'll make it up to you! Let us share some broth from [GetSelectedIngredient_1].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1844_herb;Let us talk about this, while I brew something soothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1844_liquid;Well... Would you care for some experiential [GetSelectedIngredient_1] infused beer I've made?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1844_powder;Oh, friend. You clearly need this [GetSelectedIngredient_1] infused brew of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1848;I'll name it after my dear friend, [target_friend.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1855;I'll sleep with a nugget of [GetSelectedIngredient_2] under my pillow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1900;Theurgy and the divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1900_TOOLTIP;This art will lead to the Â§YTheologianÂ§! trait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1901;The art of Theurgy is important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1928;I have the perfect location in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1928_TOOLTIP;Show your guest to the nearby location to use for the coming night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_5109;I don't really mind keeping them around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_5110;I'll paint my whole castle with the holy symbols! It's the only way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_MNM_1101;Let us build a remote guarded compound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1102;I will aim higher than any of those that have come before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1200_animal_part;Actually, I should add some ground [GetSelectedIngredient_1] to help form the pattern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1200_herb;Some crushed [GetSelectedIngredient_1] shall help form the pattern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1200_liquid;Hmm... A few drops of [GetSelectedIngredient_1] should form a magnificent pattern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1200_powder;Surely a sprinkle of [GetSelectedIngredient_1] will add to the pattern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1200_tt;Using the Â§Y[GetSelectedIngredient_1]Â§! will increase your chances of having a positive reaction to the shapes in the water.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1253;This is not the path I chose for [horoscope_child.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1253_TT;You will increase your efforts to steer Â§Y[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! into another direction in life.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1420;I do not have much to spare... Surely the local antiquary will do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1420_TT;You and Â§Y[hermetic_collaborator.GetTitledFirstName]Â§! and set off to a local antiquarian in search for an old tome.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1435;Actually, I have changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1435_TT;This is a bad idea. You retreat to the safety of your [Root.Capital.GetHolding].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1436;Our goal is maximum damage. Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1463;I did have [great_minds_guest_4.GetFirstName] in mind, but you see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1463_TT;Due your diplomatic skills, you can come up with an acceptable reason for not inviting Â§Y[great_minds_guest_4.GetTitledFirstName]Â§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1464;The noblest purpose is to further our understanding of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1464_TT;Suggest a project with a scholarly focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1478;Only the bravest and the most foolish soldiers would dare crossing its trajectory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1624;Oh Divine, pray tell me of the secrets hidden throughout the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1630;I will make an extraordinary effort! No expense shall be spared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1630_TT;You will spend extra time and resources on writing the theorem paper, even if this comes to the detriment of managing your realm. Surely this will produce a paper of high quality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1800;On second thought, I don't have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1840;I've found a new meaning in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1848;The star should bear my own name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1855;I'll attempt something new...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1900;I changed my mind. Perhaps another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1901;I will keep my current art for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1928;How about a small feast in your honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1928_TOOLTIP;Spend the time with a small feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_5110;This is foolish paranoia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_MNM_1478;We are masters of metal, my friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_MNM_1855;I'd rather not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_MNM_1928;Time not spent studying is time lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_MNM_1928_TOOLTIP;Spend the time by studying in preparation of the coming night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF_MNM_1478;Now we may safely share our ideas and discoveries with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG_MNM_1478;Fear will never seep into my heart in battle again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTH_MNM_1478;Our mill is a true contribution to society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
