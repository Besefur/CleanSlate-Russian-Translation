EVTDESC_JD_15002;'Halt!', comes a stern voice as we are approaching a bridge.\n'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledName]. We are currently guarding the road to the [offmap_china.GetFullName]... You, my fine [Root.GetLordLady], need to pay the bridge fee.' The smirk on the [other_ruler.GetManWoman]'s face makes me hesitate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15003;'Aaah, fellow travelers!' a military [other_ruler.GetManWoman] exclaims, emerging alongside a group of soldiers from the trees surrounding our camp. 'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]. We are here to escort my [Root.GetLordLady] to [Root.GetRandomChineseRegion].' [other_ruler.GetSheHeCap] gestures for [Root.GetHerHis] troops to join my entourage for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15004;A group of soldiers have blocked the route for our caravan. 'Please, we have not eaten in months', a tall [other_ruler.GetManWoman] pleads, before taking another step forwards: 'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledName]. You will let us dine with your people tonight...!' The threat sounds empty, as the leader struggles to remain upright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15010;As the days drag on, I find myself thinking back to [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName], wondering what is happening in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. And how is [person_missed.GetTitledFirstName] faring, without me there? When can I return home to [person_missed.GetHerHim], when my journey to the Middle Kingdom never seems to end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15011_A;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me a letter. Apparently, the journey to the Middle Kingdom is long and [From.GetSheHe] misses me terribly. 'You always have interesting things to say, like when we spoke about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak], remember?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15011_B;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me a letter. 'The journey to the Middle Kingdom is long', and [From.GetSheHe] has found [From.GetHerselfHimself] missing me terribly. 'I hope we can spend more time together, in the future' [From.GetSheHe] states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15015;Having reached the glorious capital of the [offmap_china.GetFullName], it only takes a few days before a group of ministers approach me, offering to read and discuss chapters from the 'Writings of Master Guan'. They think I, as a [Root.Religion.GetName], will be particularly interested by the section on 'revolving the vital breath'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15016;My guards and I have been making our way through a bustling market this morning. There is ample supply of every meat and game, and trinkets and baubles abound...! Here and there we encounter soldiers, along with dignitaries from other foreign courts. There is clearly no shortage of business for these traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15017;Our caravan has been approached by a smooth-faced [chinese_trader.Culture.GetName] [chinese_trader.GetManWoman], claiming to be a renowned trader. After finally getting my attention [chinese_trader.GetSheHe] beckons me over to [chinese_trader.GetHerHis] own horse, where something is strapped to its saddle. 'Name's [chinese_trader.GetBestName], my good [Root.GetLordLady]! Might my latest acquisition interest you?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32100;Our caravan has been camped by the roadside the whole day. The sky has been pouring over us with unusually heavy rain. The whole situation has brought my thoughts to the memories of my late [target_relative.GetRootRelation], [target_relative.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32000;The journey to visit the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] of [offmap_china.GetName] and show my subservience will take months if not even years. I take my farewells to my near and dear and prepare the caravan for departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32110;A rider approached the caravan and handed me a letter with the seal of [target_host.GetBestName]. [target_host.GetFirstName] has heard of my travels and invites our party to rest for a while in the warmth of the [target_host.GetCapitalHolding] [target_host.Capital.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32112;Regaining my conciousness I find myself in the ditch to the side of the road. In my pocket I discover a letter with the firmest handwriting reading 'This is your last warning, stay out of here!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32200;Our company has finally reached the central lands of the [offmap_china.GetFullName]. The Middle Kingdom in all its magnificence lay before us with so much to experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32211;I'm out on a walk in a beautiful park in the Middle Kingdom when I spot a group of people, intensely focused, gathered up around a square board with circular pieces in black and white.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_32216;The high priest started the ceremony right as I get inside the Taoist temple. The disciples enter a meditation to bring themselves into harmony with the cosmos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_JD_32111;A warm hearth and healthy meals has invigorated the whole company, but after enjoying the hospitality of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] for some days it's now time to get moving on our path towards [offmap_china.GetName] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JD_32113;'Trust is such a delicate thing', I tell my horse galloping away in the dark night, accompanied by the sound of screams and clattering plates while panic ensues behind us. Some of my servants also had to put their life to it for the whole charade to be believable, but that is an acceptable price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JD_32290;'The [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has kept [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] eyes on you', the Chief Minister says. '[offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHeCap] is however very busy and thought it more fitting if you bowed in here instead of the occupied throne room'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JD_32299;I cannot continue on my journey towards [offmap_china.GetFullName] since a state of hostility has occurred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_JD_32111;The previous days have certainly been a delight. I never imagined that we could have so many things in common. It's with regret that I bid farewell to [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] when we decide to move on towards our goal of [offmap_china.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JD_32113;Just as you are about to make your escape into the dead of the night you are apprehended by the Captain of the guard. Sweat started forming on the temples of your head. Any second now.\nThere's the bellowing scream of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s guts exploding. For a split second you notice the shock in the face of the Captain, as someone exclaims that the [target_host.GetTitle] is dead. Then his eyes refocus on you. Without hesitation, the burly man raises his sword and cuts you in half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JD_32290;'The [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has kept [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] eyes on you', the Chief Minister says. 'You may enter the throne room to show your subordination, but be quick about it'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JD_32299;I cannot continue on my journey towards [offmap_china.GetFullName] after they decided to close their borders and oust foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCC_JD_32111;We are presented with a deliciously looking meal when [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] raises [target_host.GetHerHis] chalice to honor us with a toast. Longing for a good drink I take a big gulp before I notice that [target_host.GetFirstName] turns [target_host.GetHerHis] chalice upside down emptying its content on the floor, laughing manically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JD_32113;During the dinner, [target_host.GetTitledFirstName], exclaims that [target_host.GetSheHe] has a present for you. Seconds later a man with an arrow sticking out of his back is dragged into the room. With fear you immediately recognize the man from your company that you ordered to assassinate [target_host.GetFirstName]. With a finger pointed towards your head [target_host.GetFirstName] shouts 'I sentence you all to die for your treachery!'. From every corner of the room, guards with drawn weapons are closing a circle fast around your band.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JD_32290;The Chief Minister opens the doors to the throne room nodding for me to enter. After I've performed a deep bow in sign of subservience the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] reaches out and touches my forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JD_32299;I cannot continue on my journey towards [offmap_china.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_15002;When in... wherever we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15002_tt;You and your entourage are let through.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15003;Oh, [other_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]! There's... been a change of plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15003_tt;While you obviously did not hire these mercenaries, you caravan might benefit from some more military protection.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15004;No need for posturing, [other_ruler.GetTitle]. We have enough food for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15004_tt;§Y[other_ruler.GetTitledName]§! and [other_ruler.GetHerHis] soldiers appreciate your generosity.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15010;Halt! I need to send a letter to my dear [person_missed.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15011_A;Aw... I do remember that...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15011_B;I hope we will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15015;Of course! I would love to hear more about your political philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15015_TT;The ministers are excited by your enthusiasm!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15016;Mmmh, what is that smell...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15016_TT;You eagerly partake in the local cuisine.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15017;Ooh, that looks [chinese_artifact.GetArtifactDescriptor]. Let me take it off your hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15017_TT;§Y[chinese_artifact.GetName]§! is transfered to your Treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32000;Let's get going!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_brave;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was the bravest person I've known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_charming;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] charmed everyone with that smirk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_cruel;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was a complicated person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_genius;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was always so clever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_good;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was such a good person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_just;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] could always tell right from wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_kind;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was always kind to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_learned;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was the wisest person I've known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_mystic;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] always worked in mysterious ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_pious;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] was such a pious role model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32100_young;[target_relative.GetSheHeCap] died far too young.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32110;This could prove to be an opportunity to get even.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32111;Thank you for being an excellent host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32112;I have a terrible ache in my whole body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32113;[target_host.GetSheHeCap] should have known better than to trust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32200;Let us walk lest I forget about the reason for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32211;Let me show you how it's done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32216;Study their rituals from a distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32290;Bow before the depiction of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_32299;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_JD_15002;I won't give in to idle threats. Guards, my sword – now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15003;I think you have me confused with someone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15003_tt;You explain the situation. The mercenaries are disappointed, but soon leave you and your people alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15004;The [offmap_china.GetFullName] clearly does nothing for you... You should work for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15004_tt;§Y[other_ruler.GetTitle]§! abandons [other_ruler.GetHerHis] mercenary way of life and joins your court instead.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15010;Halt! I need to compose some thoughts to my friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15015;Actually, I'm already well familiar with 'the Guanzi', my lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15015_TT;The ministers are impressed by your knowledge.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15016;I am here to trade! You there, let's talk business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15016_TT;You offer you patronage to the local traders, allowing you to bring home a §YChinese artifact§!...!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15017;You're certainly a charmer... I could use someone like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_15017_TT;The [chinese_trader.GetManWoman] eyes you up and down, before shrugging in agreement.\n§Y[chinese_trader.GetTitledName]§! joins your court.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32100;I can't dwell in the past, I need to carry on forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32110;A warm bed and a hot meal is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32110_RIVAL;Is my old rival prepared to bury the hatchet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32111;Let's keep in touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32113;Now we're even!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32211;'How do you play this game?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32216;Join in on their ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_32290;Refuse this humiliation and storm out of the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_JD_15002;We will have none of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15002_tt;You hurl a spear at the [other_ruler.GetTitle] before [other_ruler.GetSheHe] has time to finish smirking.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15004;We cannot afford to take pity on strangers...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15004_tt;The mercenaries get out of your way.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15010;Guards! I need to send a letter to my [person_missed.GetHusbandWife].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15015;Nonsense! I want to look around the palace – perhaps a tour?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15015_TT;The ministers see to that you are accompanied through the public areas of the capital.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15016;Guards... You keep that trader occupied...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15016_TT;You proceed to steal from one of the local traders, allowing you to bring home a §YChinese artifact§!...!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15017;Guards. I'm suddenly in the mood for a gift...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_15017_TT;You order your guards to cut down the trader and steal the goods for you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32110;I prefer my tent as accommodation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32111;Thank you but we need to be on our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32113;There is no escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32211;I'll just enjoy the park instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32216;Loudly criticize their false religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_32290;Hastily perform the kowtow before the silent [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_JD_15010;Guards! I need to send a letter to my [person_missed.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_15016;I think I've had enough for one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_15017;Flattery gets you nowhere, peddler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_15017_TT;You have better things to do.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_32111;No, you! You...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_32216;Study the symbolism used in their texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_32290;I'm honored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_JD_15010;Halt! My [person_missed.GetSonDaughter] needs a letter from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF_JD_15010;No, my retinue needs their [Root.GetTitle] riding, alongside them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_JD_32113;Fatal Hospitality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JD_KOWTOW;Kowtow to China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_JD_BAD_INFLUENCE_ON_EMPEROR_EVALUATION;This might reflect §Rpoorly§! on you, in the eyes of the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_JD_GOOD_INFLUENCE_ON_EMPEROR_EVALUATION;This might reflect §Gwell§! on you, in the eyes of the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPA_JD_32100;You burn incense to honor their memory and step outside to wash away your tears under the crying sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JD_32200;You start to travel on the imperial roads towards the celestial palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JD_32110;You utilize your rival's hospitality to set up a risky murder attempt on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JD_32112;You turn over and empty your bowels in the ditch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPB_JD_32110;You accept the invitation to the court of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPD_JD_32111;The room starts spinning and you black out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
