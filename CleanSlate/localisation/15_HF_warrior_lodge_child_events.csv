EVTDESCHF25401;I have noticed that, since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], my [new_recruit.GetRootRelation] has been eschewing [new_recruit.GetHerHis] studies in favor of training with the other fighters. It has become impossible to sit [new_recruit.GetHerHim] down to read a book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25402;I have scarcely had time to focus on my literary studies since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], yet I would be lying if I said that I miss spend long nights at candlelight, reading about dead people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25403;I have scarcely had time to focus on my literary studies since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], and while I have no problem with that, my [GetFromRelation] is livid. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that I should find the time to both train and read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25404;I have noticed that, since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], my [new_recruit.GetRootRelation] has been avoiding [new_recruit.GetHerHis] responsibilities as a [new_recruit.GetTitle] to focus entirely on martial arts. If it keeps going like this, [new_recruit.GetSheHe] will soon be unfit to even administer a pig farm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25405;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have had very little time to think of my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], what with all the training I have been going through. Still, learning to fight is certainly more exciting than hearing tedious complaints from peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25406;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have had very little time to think of my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], what with all the training I have been going through. Unfortunately, this does not sit well with [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has ordered me to find the time both to train in the art war and statesmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25407;I have noticed that, since joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], my [new_recruit.GetRootRelation] has spent barely any time at court, learning to act as [From.GetHerHis] rank demands. Being in contact with all these coarse fighters is making [From.GetHerHim] adopt mannerisms that are unfitting of [From.GetHerHis] stature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25408;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have spent very little time at court. Not that I mind, of course. The place is filled with boorish snobs and entitled sissies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25409;Since my [GetFromRelation] made me join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] I have spent very little time at court. Not that I mind, of course. The place is filled with boorish snobs and entitled sissies. Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] is not of the same opinion. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that I should learn how to deal with my vassals and subjects as my title demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25410;I have noticed that all of this focus on physical activity might be dimming [From.GetFirstName]'s mind. My [From.GetSonDaughter] has been ignoring many of [From.GetHerHis] other studies and responsibilities to better refine [From.GetHerHis] combat skills, openly belittling their importance compared to the art of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25411;Today, [From.GetFirstName] took some time from [From.GetHerHis] responsibilities to scold me about what it means to be a warrior. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks that I am focusing too much on the physical aspect of my training, and that I should know it takes both a strong body and a strong mind to make a good fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25412;The past few months I have been focusing entirely on my training with [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], and the effects are showing. And all I had to do to become so strong was to neglect all my other studies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25414;Today, [From.GetFirstName] took some time to scold me about my training. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that spending so much time with uncouth riffraff is making me lose my manners and forgo any care about my looks, an behavior unfitting for a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25415;The past few months I have been focusing entirely on my training with [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], and the effects are showing. I cannot believe how strong I have become. I might be always reeking of sweat and blood, but I can scarcely argue with results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25416;[child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] told me that [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHe] is concerned about my [GetFromRelation], claiming that the child lacks the grit and bravery of a true member of [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [child_hero_mentor.GetFirstName] thinks that forcing my [GetFromRelation] to confront [From.GetHerHis] fears is the best way to help [From.GetHerHim] overcome them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25417;My [GetFromRelation] and [child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] have approached me today with a dangerous task to complete. They claim that the best way for me to overcome my fears is to leave [Root.Capital.GetName] and spend a few days in the wilds, learning how to survive on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25424;I spent most of the afternoon training with dull weapons with [child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] under my [GetFromRelation]'s watch. It was not easy to keep up with such a good and harsh teacher. I might have collected quite a few bruises, but I also learned several interesting new moves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25413;I could not fail to notice how joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] seems to have roughened up my [GetFromRelation]. The training [From.GetSheHe] is going through is undoubtedly getting results, but it is also turning my clean, handsome [GetFromRelation] into a coarse, foul-mouthed fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25418;[child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] approached me today to talk about my [GetFromRelation]. [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHeCap] fears that the child is growing too fat to be a proper warrior, and we need to take drastic measures if we want to put [From.GetHerHim] on the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25419;[child_hero_mentor.GetTitledFirstName] claims that I need to eat less and train more if I wish to become a worthy member of [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHeCap] says that my [GetFromRelation] has given [child_hero_mentor.GetHerHim] permission to put me through an intensive training regiment to get me in better shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25420;Letting [child_hero_mentor.GetFirstName] handle the issue was a good decision. [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHeCap] was able to change my [GetFromRelation]'s habits and slowly turn [From.GetHerHim] into a fit young [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25422;Unfortunately, even with [child_hero_mentor.GetFirstName]'s help, my [GetFromRelation] still remains a stout, slow recruit amongst [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. I can only hope [From.GetHerHis] physical state does not hinder [From.GetHerHim] too much as [From.GetSheHe] continues with [From.GetHerHis] training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25423;[child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] has approached me today, offering to put my [GetFromRelation] through an intensive training session, hoping to improve [From.GetHerHis] dueling skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], I have had not a single day of peace. Being a fighter is simply too much of a bother to me. All of these training sessions have been an unbearable chore to go through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25426;My [GetFromRelation] has confronted me today about my decision to have [From.GetHerHim] join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the training is too hard and [From.GetSheHe] does not feel like [From.GetSheHe] is fit to be a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25427;My [GetFromRelation] did not take well my request. [From.GetSheHeCap] yelled at me that it is my duty to become a warrior like [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] will not tolerate any insubordination on my part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25428;Since our last fight, [From.GetFirstName] has been very gloomy, barely even speaking to me or any of [From.GetHerHis] friends. Forcing [From.GetHerHim] to keep training to be a warrior might have not been the best decision on my part...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25429;Far from obeying my decision to become a warrior, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to flee [Root.Capital.GetName]! And, as if that wasn't enough, my [GetFromRelation] stole as much [From.GetSheHe] could carry from my treasury before leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25430;Since our last fight, [From.GetFirstName] has been very gloomy, barely even speaking to me or any of [From.GetHerHis] friends. Yet, I could have never imagined that forcing [From.GetHerHim] to keep training would have led [From.GetHerHim] to take [From.GetHerHis] own life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25432;I have recently heard news of my [GetFromRelation] from [From.GetHerHis] exile. [From.GetSheHeCap] now lives in [From.Capital.GetName], spending [From.GetHerHis] eating and drinking, with no accomplishments to [From.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25433;I have recently heard news of my [GetFromRelation] from [From.GetHerHis] exile. [From.GetSheHeCap] now lives in [From.Capital.GetName], and has become a frail, soft-spoken bookworm, buried in a moldy library, with no accomplishments to [From.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25434;I have recently heard news of my [GetFromRelation] from [From.GetHerHis] exile. [From.GetSheHeCap] now lives in [From.Capital.GetName], and has become a frivolous, vapid courtier, sniveling at the feet of better people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25435;I have recently heard news of my [GetFromRelation] from [From.GetHerHis] exile. [From.GetSheHeCap] now lives in [From.Capital.GetName], and has become a paranoid loner living at the edge of society, barely tolerated by [From.GetHerHis] peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25413;I could not fail to notice how joining [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] seems to have roughened up my [GetFromRelation]. The training [From.GetSheHe] is going through is undoubtedly getting results, but it is also turning my sweet, delicate [GetFromRelation] into a coarse, foul-mouthed fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25418;[child_hero_mentor.GetBestName] approached me today to talk about my [GetFromRelation]. [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHeCap] fears that the child is growing too weak and sickly to be a proper warrior, and we need to take drastic measures if we want to put [From.GetHerHim] on the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25419;[child_hero_mentor.GetTitledFirstName] claims that I need to eat and train more if I wish to become a worthy member of [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [child_hero_mentor.GetSheHeCap] says that my [GetFromRelation] has given [child_hero_mentor.GetHerHim] permission to put me through an intensive training regiment to get me in better shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25422;Unfortunately, even with [child_hero_mentor.GetFirstName]'s help, my [GetFromRelation] still remains a scrawny, feeble recruit amongst [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. I can only hope [From.GetHerHis] physical state does not hinder [From.GetHerHim] too much as [From.GetSheHe] continues with [From.GetHerHis] training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], I have had not a single day of peace. My new playmates are illiterate brutes, forcing me to perform the most humiliating tasks. I wanted to become a scholar, not a fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25426;My [GetFromRelation] has confronted me today about my decision to have [From.GetHerHim] join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the art of war does not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be a scholar instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], life has been a constant torment for me. I am a [Root.GetManWoman], my place is not on the field of battle, needlessly risking my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25426;My [GetFromRelation] has confronted me today about my decision to have [From.GetHerHim] join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that fighting is simply not a [From.GetManWoman]'s job, and demands that I allow [From.GetHerHim] to leave the Lodge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF25425;Ever since my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] forced me to join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName], life has been a constant torment for me. All of this talk of duels and war is too much for me to bear. I do not really have the stomach to be a fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25426;My [GetFromRelation] has confronted me today about my decision to have [From.GetHerHim] join [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the prospective of fighting other people makes [From.GetHerHim] uneasy and jittery. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes I could reconsider my decision to make [From.GetHerHim] become a warrior like myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25401;That is how it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25402;What are books for anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25403;But it's so boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25404;War is more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25405;That stuff was always boring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25406;But stewardship is so boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25407;As long as [From.GetSheHe] learns how to fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25408;What do they know of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25409;But why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25410;But a smart fighter is a good fighter, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25411;I guess so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25412;Books are for weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25413;Absolutely intolerable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25414;All this fuss for a bit of dirt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25415;Grooming is for courtesans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25416;I trust your judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25417;I-I am not sure about that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25418;I agree, we must do what necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25419;I will not disappoint you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25420;I am so proud of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25422;Perhaps we should try this again in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25423;By all means, proceed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25424;Can we train again tomorrow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25425;[recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation], I do not want to be a warrior anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25426;You are my [GetFromRelation], and you will obey me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25427;As you wish, [GetFromRelation]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25428_A;But I did it for [From.GetHerHis] own good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25428_B;[From.GetSheHeCap] will learn to love it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25429_A;How could [From.GetSheHe] do this to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25429_B;That little ingrate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25429_C;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no longer my [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25430_A;What have I done!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25430_B;Why would [From.GetSheHe] do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25430_C;A coward to the end, I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25432;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25433;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25434;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25435;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25401;[new_recruit.GetSheHeCap] should learn to divide [new_recruit.GetHerHis] attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25404;This will not do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25407;I won't have [From.GetHerHim] grow into a thug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25410;I wouldn't have it any other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25413;As long as it's making [From.GetHerHim] stronger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25416;I will not let you put my [GetFromRelation]'s life at risk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25418;[From.GetSheHeCap] is fine as [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25419;But I like how I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25423;I think it's still a bit early for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25425;Still, I must obey my [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation]'s wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25426;If this is what you wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25427;I am not your slave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF25427;I cannot live like this anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
