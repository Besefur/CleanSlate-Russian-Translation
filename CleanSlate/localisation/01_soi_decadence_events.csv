EVTTITLE91241;The Price of Decadence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC91000;The excesses of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Dynasty have gone too far. A dynamic warrior clan has taken up arms and is riding to purify the realm of our decadence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91200;Alcoholic beverages are considered haraam in the Islamic faith - forbidden. This, however, has not stopped you from consuming copious amounts of wine and getting plastered on a regular basis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91201;Your attraction to those of your same sex is frowned upon by the rest of society, but there are times when you simply grow tired of keeping up appearances. The people do not look kindly on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91202;Some visiting imams walk in on you as your servants are busily smearing your body with honey, covering you from top to bottom. For some reason they react in horror at this sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91203;It is becoming increasingly difficult to conceal your secret vice - impaling your enemies on wooden stakes and listening to their cries of despair. Concerns have been raised about how appropriate this behavior is for someone of your station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91204;Why should you settle for one woman, or two, or a dozen? The carnal pleasures of the flesh beckon, and let no man say you are undeserving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91205;Your enormous appetite cannot be sated. As the poor of your realm starve, your servants bring delicacies from the most distant lands to your table. A 'light lunch' for you would be enough to feed a peasant family for a week or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91206;You have been doing your best to suck the people of [Root.Location.GetName] dry of what few possessions they have. No matter how much of their wealth is channeled your way, you always want more. The lifestyle you have grown accustomed to is an expensive one indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91207;The truly enlightened ruler must conserve all energy for the act of ruling itself. It is for this reason that you have expanded your staff of servants tenfold. Tedious activities such as walking, bringing food to your mouth or the wiping of your regal behind are a thing of the past for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91208;More and more of your waking hours are being spent comparing your worldly possessions with those of other rulers. For someone of your same station to have a more lavish palace or prettier garments is simply unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91209;Your foul temper is frequently discussed in hushed voices among your palace staff. Furniture, silverware, mirrors - everything is fair game when your mood turns bad and you feel the need to break or throw something. If your palace was ever looted, would anyone be able to tell the difference?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91210;You order the construction of a massive bronze statue over the main entrance of [Root.Location.GetName] depicting yourself holding a raised sword, challenging the very heavens to strike you down if they dare. This generous gift to the people will help them remember your splendor and brilliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91211;Your deceitfulness and guile sometimes serve you well, but it has also earned you a reputation among your subjects as someone who is not to be trusted. They simply do not see you as a man of honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91212;While there are some rulers who take an active role in military affairs, the safety of the palace life is far more appealing to you. Why, if you ventured beyond the palace gates, something could hurt you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91213;While there are always those who moan and mutter about the need to continually better oneself and strive for improvement, you are quite content with the way things are now. The land is yours to rule, you have a beautiful palace and the sun still shines warmly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91214;Justice and the rule of law do not interest you, unless they happen to coincide with your own sense of how things should be. Many of your subjects are grumbling about how you seem to hold yourself above the laws they have to observe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91215;Your cynical view of all religious matters has resulted in you only observing those elements of the Muslim faith you find convenient and ignoring the rest. Some of your subjects are muttering about this lack of piousness on your part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91216;You suspect everyone around you of treachery, to the point where your servants and staff are terrified of even breathing in your presence. The size and influence of your palace guard has increased tenfold as everything, good or bad, has to pass through them before reaching you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91217;You take great pleasure in inflicting cruel punishments on your servants and subjects. If there is no reason to punish them, you find it easy enough to invent one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91218;You always seem to be thinking several steps ahead of the people near you. There are few people alive who can match your mental prowess, and when your intellect is focused on a single problem, people know a solution will be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91219;Your decision to put aside your carnal desires and lead a life of celibacy is applauded by the people, either because they admire your sacrifice or because they are relieved you are less likely to procreate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91220;As a dedicated scholar, you have gained many valuable insights from all the tomes you have studied. From the Quran to ancient treatises on farming techniques and history, there is great wisdom to be found in all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91221;Your chaste and virtuous lifestyle is held as an example even far beyond the borders of those lands belonging to you. If only all men lived thus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91222;Where other rulers often abuse their positions and give in to excess, you have always valued moderation in all things. This quality is admired by the people you rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91223;You are always ready to give to those less fortunate than yourself, and when a rockslide destroyed the homes of several poor families in [Root.Location.GetName], you offered them temporary lodgings in your palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91224;Your tireless and diligent work as their ruler has not gone unnoticed by your people. Some have dubbed you 'He Who Appears Everywhere' and claim you possess supernatural powers to exist in more than one place at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91225;You have become renowned for your kind rule, and your people love you for it. There are those who would call you soft, but even they are impressed by the devotion your subjects show you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91226;Your ability to plan for the long-term and see the big picture has served you well as a ruler. Future generations will thank you for the work you do today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91227;You always strive to be humble, never forgetting the roots of yourself and your ancestors. There are many lessons from the past that must still be heeded today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91228;Your honest nature and tendency to speak what is on your mind has ruffled a few feathers in the past, but it has also earned you great respect. People know that your words ring true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91229;Your enemies would accuse you of many things, but not even they would label you a coward. It is well known that you are fearless and always willing to share the dangers faced by your men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91230;You are an ambitious man, always striving to improve and do better. The people know this, and though some of your decisions may be unpopular, they are usually at least seen as progressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91231;Just and fair in all things, your people rest easy in the knowledge that no matter what, you can always be depended on to observe the rule of law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91232;No one can question your devotion to Allah and the teachings of his Prophet (peace be upon him). You can always be counted on to put your faith ahead of yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91233;You have proven your devotion to Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) by making war against the enemies of Islam. As one of the mujahideen, you are acknowledged to have fought in a Jihad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91234;You have completely memorized the Quran, an accomplishment that not only shows your devotion to Allah (glorified and exalted be He), but which has also won you great respect as a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91235;It is a well known fact that you have completed the Hajj and thus shown your submission and devotion to Allah (may He be glorified and exalted). Whatever else they may say about you, no one can take this away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91240;After a brutal civil war, the decadent dynasty of my former liege has finally been overthrown by the [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] clan. In the transitional chaos, I could probably get away with a declaration of independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91241;The ruling dynasty of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been overthrown by the zealous and hard-living tribesmen of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. Their decadent [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetTier] has been toppled, freeing any vassals from their bondage to the unworthy [FromFrom.GetTitle]. With the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetTier] gone, time will tell if a worthy dynasty will be up to the task of restoring authority to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91300;I had the spice merchant beaten for the contemptuous look he gave me. Apparently, there are many who think I have grown soft and decadent, lost to vices and indulging in haram!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91350;My [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetBestName] has let me know that my sinful living shames the entire dynasty. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] is exerting [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] influence to shield House [Root.GetDynName], but strongly urges me to seek guidance in the perfect example set by the Prophet (peace be upon him.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91351;My decadent [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] refuses to change [From.GetPossPronoun] sinful ways. I can declare [From.GetObjectPronoun] a kafir, which will give me a reason to imprison the degenerate... unless there is another way to get through to [From.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91352;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] understands that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is living a life of haram, and has ensured me that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is committed to changing [From.GetPossPronoun] ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91355;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] just will not give up. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] makes some most persuasive arguments about why I need to overcome my forbidden, haram, desires. For the sake of my soul, my dynasty and my religion, I need to repent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91356;I just cannot get through to my wastrel [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]! [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is simply too weak and obstinate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91357;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] understands that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is living a life of haram, and has ensured me that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is committed to changing [From.GetPossPronoun] ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91360;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is back to persuade my to abandon my forbidden, haram, desires. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] quotes the Koran and the Hadiths like a mufti and threatens me with the fires of Jehennom in the afterlife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91361;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] was moved to tears by my fiery exhortations. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] will join a holy order in order to serve Allah best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91362;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] was moved to tears by my fiery exhortations and left immediately for the holy pilgrimage to Mecca - the Hajj.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91363;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] was shaken by the strength of my pious arguments and promised to reform [From.GetPossPronoun] ways, starting with a generous donation to charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91365;I woke up to a dreadful stench and found my room full of the rotting carcasses of dogs and pigs. As I staggered out through the door, a shadowy figure crept up from behind and held a knife to my throat, whispering 'This is what your life is like. Imagine your death...' before disappearing without a trace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91366;I arranged a very unpleasant 'awakening' for my decadent [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSubjectPronoun] remains stubbornly committed to [From.GetPossPronoun] hedonism, bringing shame on our House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91367;The little nightmare I staged seems to have worked on my decadent [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName], who is scared witless and has promised to renounce [From.GetPossPronoun] shameful hedonism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91368;It seems the nighttime show I put on for my decadent [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] was a little too much. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] chose to jump from a tower rather than live a righteous life as a true Muslim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91369;[From.GetBestName] has failed in [From.GetPossPronoun] attempts to get the decadent [FromFrom.GetBestName] to straighten up. He is a kafir and can be imprisoned freely by all rulers of our shamed dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91370;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has become Decadent, bringing shame to the House of [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91372;My agents have brought me a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName], who still refuses my demands that [From.GetSheHe] straighten up! [From.GetSheHeCap] offered to give me a strong eunuch of great martial ability as a gift if I allow [From.GetHerHim] to persist in [From.GetHerHis] decadence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91373;[From.GetTitledFirstName] talked to me about how [From.GetSheHe] has chosen to live [From.GetHerHis] own life. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] tried to explain to me me that what I have viewed as decadence was merely a different way of honoring [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s will. [From.GetSheHeCap] also offered to make a religious donation in my name as a gesture of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91374;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came to my chambers and whispered pretty words in my ear. [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] insists that [From.GetSheHe] ought to be thrown in jail due to [From.GetHerHis] decadent ways, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] now seems to be very different from what I had heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91375;My spouse is upset about what [From.GetSheHe] refers to as my unnecessarily harsh attitude towards [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] decadent ways, and asks me to leave [FromFrom.GetHerHim] alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91376;My spouse came to me with shocking news. Apparently [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has tried to seduce my beloved [From.GetHusbandWife] and turn [From.GetHerHim] against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_91377;My husband, [From.GetName], has in a sudden fit of religious piety gone off to join the [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. This effectively annuls our marriage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_91378;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy with my refusal, but why should I care? Although now [From.GetSheHe] reminds me of the favor I owe [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_91379;Finally my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to listen to reason. [From.GetSheHeCap] will not live a life of vice any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA91000;Allah be Merciful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91200;*hic*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91201;Let them say what they want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91202;What? I left enough for tomorrow's breakfast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91203;You will not rob me of the one thing I enjoy in life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91204;Come here, my pretty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91205;Let me just remove my belt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91206;It is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91207;Ah, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91208;I deserve only the very best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91209;It can all be replaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91210;They should be thankful I am their ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91211;Honour is a weakness I cannot afford.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91212;Guards, I don't like the way that child looked at me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91213;There is not a single thing I would change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91214;I AM the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91215;Oh, let them mutter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91216;They will not catch me unawares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91217;I will teach you not to blink so much in my presence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91218;Allah (glorified and exalted be He) does not play dice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91219;I did it for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91220;There is so much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91221;The world would be a better place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91222;Indulgence leads to weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91223;Every day the sun rises, charity is due on every joint of a person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91224;I have never been afraid of a little hard work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91225;The carrot, not the stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91226;Great things come to those who wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91227;I will not forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91228;The truth is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91229;Never give in to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91230;Why settle for mediocrity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91231;Law should govern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91232;Laa ilaha ilallah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91233;The best jihad is the one in which your horse is slain and your blood is spilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91234;It was not easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91235;It was my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91240;Stay Loyal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91241;Bloated fools...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91300;Bah! Minstrel, play another song!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91350;How rude! My life is my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91351;Invoke Takfir against [From.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91352;Good, House [Root.GetDynName] must stay pure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91355;I know I am weak. Too weak!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91360;Do I look like a believer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91361;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] makes me proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91362;A pious choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91363;There is hope for [From.GetObjectPronoun] yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91365;[From.GetTitledFirstName] cannot scare me with theatrics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91368;Shameful! Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91369;A shoe on his head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91370;The ingrate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91372;I could surely use such a eunuch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91373;Such a donation would surely please [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91374;I have fallen in love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91375;Everything for you, my love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91378;I guess I have no choice. I will try to please [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91379;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] must surely be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB91240;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91350;I will try, with the help of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91351;I am a better negotiator than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91355;Though it's hard, I shall walk the narrow path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91360;I must join the Bektashi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91365;Maybe I had better shape up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91374;This is clearly just an act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC91351;I must save [From.GetPossPronoun] soul from the fires of Jahannam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC91355;Maybe I can appeal to [From.GetHerHis] greedy side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC91360;I must join the Hashshashin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC91365;This is just too much. Life is not worth living!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD91351;Time to get... unconventional.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD91355;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will be pleased if I donate some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD91360;I must go on the Hajj to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE91351;It is time to call in that favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE91351_TOOLTIP;Force §Y[This.GetTitledFirstName]§! to give up his vices.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE91355;Maybe I can bring [From.GetHerHis] [From.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] over to my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE91360;I will donate money to charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP91351;Tell [This.GetFirstName] to mind his own business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91352;Promise [This.GetFirstName] to lead a righteous life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91355;Make a better attempt at convincing [This.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91360;Present the best religious arguments to [This.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91365;Arrange for some nasty nighttime theatrics to scare [This.GetFirstName] in [From.GetPossPronoun] room;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91374A;[Root.Spouse.GetName] is asked to leave [From.GetName] alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP91374B;[Root.Spouse.GetName] is informed about [From.GetName]s plans..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
