EVTDESC_TOG_600;You have sent out summons to all of your vassals for the blot. Those that have been baptized or profess to follow the teachings of the Prophet will have to offer gold to be exempted from this magnificent feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_601;Your wise liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to a blot. There you will worship and give sacrifice to the gods before taking part in a great feast where you drink to their name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_602;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], remains trapped in [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, and now [From.GetSheHe] has summoned all of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to a blot where [From.GetSheHe] intends to give sacrifice to [From.GetHerHis] pagan gods. Since you do not practise their heathen religion, you will be expected to contribute gold in order to be exempted from this ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_603;[From.GetTitledFirstName], your vassal, is stubborn in [From.GetHerHis] ways and speaks only of the mercy of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], but [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to offer you some gold to be exempted from the blot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_604;The guests have arrived, and the time has come for the blot to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshipers themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_605;The time has come for the blot held by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshipers themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_606;Although you have been told little, the noise from outside your dungeon is enough to make it clear that your captor, [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is holding a blot where [Root.Host.GetSheHe] will offer sacrifice in worship of [Root.Host.GetHerHis] gods. Guards burst inside your cell and drag you away to the gallows outside the local temple... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_610;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. A noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. A small yellow pool forms at [From.GetFirstName]'s feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_611;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] steadies [From.GetHerselfHimself] and murmurs several passages that you recognize as being from the Christian holy book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_612;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck while [From.GetSheHe] murmurs a passage with closed eyes from the Mohammedan holy book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_613;Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from his dungeon and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around his neck, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_614;Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up from her dungeon and escorted to the temple. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your guards place the noose around her neck. Please, [Root.GetFirstName], she says with a trembling voice. Don't let them do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_615;The guards drag your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and escort him to the temple where they place the noose around his neck. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_616;Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from her dungeon. They bring her to the temple and as they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_617;The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and lead him to the temple. There a noose is placed around his neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. Before your men pull at the rope, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_618;Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from her dungeon and brought to the temple by your guards. As they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_619;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from your dungeons by the guards and placed at the gallows in front of the temple. As they place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_620;Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the gallows in front of the temple and your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck. In a last desperate effort to save  [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_621;From deep within your dungeons, your guards bring out [From.GetTitledFirstName], your Skræling prisoner. As they drag [From.GetHerHim] to the front of the temple and place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, the Skræling shouts something in [From.GetHerHis] own language and stares at you defiantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_622;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the great oak in front of the temple and a noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body dangles limply in the cold breeze from one of the tree branches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_623;Your liege's guards have brought a Christian, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the big oak in front of the temple. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to prattle on about the Holy Spirit and how we shall all suffer in Hell for our sins... but soon [FromFrom.GetSheHe] speaks no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_624;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a Mohammedan from your liege's dungeons, has been brought to the temple and will now be sacrificed to the gods. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] quotes a passage from their holy book right up until the rope tightens and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] feet rise off the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_625;Your liege has told [From.GetHerHis] men to fetch [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own brother, from the dungeons. [From.GetFirstName] betrays no emotion as [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is brought up to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon his limp body can be seen slowly dangling back and forth in the wind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_626;It seems your liege has decided to sacrifice [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own sister, to the gods. She has been brought out from [From.GetFirstName]'s dark dungeons, and while she squints her eyes in the unfamiliar daylight, the guards place a noose around her neck. Moments later her eyes are forever dead and listless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_627;To your surprise, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orders [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guards to bring out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] - [FromFrom.GetHerHis] own father. He is brought to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon he joins the others hanging limply from the branches with dead, gaping eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_628;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the mother of your liege, appears at the temple flanked by guards, and to your surprise they escort her right up to the gallows. She pleads in vain with [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] will not be moved. Within moments, she dangles next to the other offerings in the trees outside the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_629;[From.GetTitledFirstName] marches [From.GetTitledHerHis] own son, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gallows outside the temple. He is to be the next sacrifice. All of his pleas fall on deaf ears, and moments later the guards place the noose around his neck and he is made forever silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_630;Those assembled at the blot gasp in surprise when [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], daughter of [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up to the gallows for the next sacrifice. She asks her [From.GetFatherMother] for mercy, but none is forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_631;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a member of [From.GetFirstName]'s own extended family, is dragged from the dungeons and brought to the temple. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that they are of the same blood, [From.GetFirstName] shows no mercy and the sacrifice takes place as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_632;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decided to sacrifice [From.GetHerHis] own spouse, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gods, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been brought in chains to the temple. Despite professing [FromFrom.GetHerHis] continued love, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to go ahead with the sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_633;In honor of this blot, your liege produces a Skræling from deep within [From.GetHerHis] dungeons. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is brought to the temple for the sacrifice, and everyone agrees that this is a most worthy sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_634;As you have no prisoners languishing in your dungeons that are suitable for sacrifice at the blot, you are forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_635;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] had no prisoners languishing in [From.GetHerHis] dungeons that were suitable for sacrifice at the blot, your liege was forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_636;Despite having sworn you fealty, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to offer gold in order to be exempted from the blot! According to [From.GetFirstName], [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] would not forgive [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] contributed as much as a single copper to a heathen festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_637;As you stand trembling with the noose around your neck, [From.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly seems to have had a change of mind. The noose is removed and you are brought back to the dungeon. It looks like you will live to see another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_640;With the sacrifice over, the feast at the end of the blot can now begin. The meat of the animals that were sacrificed has already been prepared, and there is plenty of mead to go around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_642;The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until you hold the next one, but as your vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_643;The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until your liege holds the next one, but as you and the other vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_650;The mead and the spirits being served at the feast have gotten the better of you. You tried to be strong this time, and you did your best to stay away, but the pull was just too great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_651;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been drinking more and more since the feast began, and [From.GetSheHe] has now reached a point where [From.GetSheHe] he can no longer stand upright. Surrounded by empty tankards and singing at the top of [From.GetHerHis] lungs, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying on the table amidst the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_653;Your mouth waters as servants place tray after tray of food on the table, and when the other guests engage in conversation, the only sounds coming from your corner are grunts and burps as you begin stuffing yourself. A sudden nausea sets in and you hurry towards the exit, but only make it as far as the lap of [From.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_654;Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as your seat before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into your lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_655;Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as [glutton_victim.GetTitledFirstName] before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into poor [glutton_victim.GetFirstName]'s lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_656;As you enjoy the feast, you are struck by the warmth and kindness of those sitting next to you at the table. In fact, it's getting just a little too warm. You strip off your clothes and jump up on the table. "Help, I'm on fire!", you scream at the top of your lungs while waving your arms as the other bewildered guests look on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_657;You are enjoying the feast when a shrill scream from the other end of the room suddenly draws your attention. Stark naked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is running around on the table waving [From.GetHerHis] arms while screaming that [From.GetSheHe] is on fire. You groan and bury your face in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_658;One of the serving girls has been eyeing you ever since you arrived at the feast, and now, fortified with mead, your hands grope at her body and she returns the favor. You pull off each other's clothes and give in to passion. Just as you join in her screams of pleasure, it dawns on you that you're doing this in full view of all the other stunned guests...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_659;You are conversing with another guest when loud screams of passion interrupt. In one corner of the room, in full view of everyone else, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is engaged in carnal pleasures with one of the serving girls. Both are completely naked, and only when they notice the stunned silence in the room do they seem to remember where they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_661;You have been seated next to [other_vassal_guest.GetTitledFirstName] for the duration of the feast, and you have found [other_vassal_guest.GetHerHim] to be a most agreeable person. There seems to be much you have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_664;Your mind wanders as you sit at your table during the feast, when suddenly you lock eyes with [other_homosexual_guest.GetTitledFirstName]. Something about [other_homosexual_guest.GetHerHis] gaze seems to reach into your heart, and when [other_homosexual_guest.GetSheHe] steps outside for some fresh air, you quickly excuse yourself to join [other_homosexual_guest.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_669;You are locked in the embrace of your lover, and just as you kiss each other another guest wanders out of the feast hall and notices you. Though you immediately let go of each other, the damage is already done as the outraged guest rushes back inside to tell everyone what he saw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_670;With everything spinning from all the mead you drank, you stumble towards the exit to relieve yourself. As you step outside, you are treated to the sight of [first_homosexual_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and [second_homosexual_guest.GetTitledFirstName], embracing each other and kissing passionately. They immediately stop when they notice you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_680;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. When [From.GetSheHe] sees the dangling noose about to be placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] pushes the nearest guard aside and makes a desperate run for it, but to no avail. Your men drag [From.GetHerHim] kicking and screaming back to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_681;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] stares vacantly ahead without betraying any emotion whatsoever. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] has accepted [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_682;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As soon as [From.GetSheHe] spots you among those gathered nearby, [From.GetSheHe] hurls insults and spittle your way, continuing even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck. The hatred in [From.GetHerHis] eyes cannot be mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_600;I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_601;I wouldn't miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_602;I suppose I have no choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_603;As well [From.GetSheHe] should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_604;Now for the human sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_606;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_610;Allfather, we offer you this sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_611;Where is your Blessed Virgin now, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_611_Pope;All the power of your Church cannot save you, [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_612;Soon you shall meet your Prophet, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_612_Caliph;There shall be no peace upon you, [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_613;I'm afraid not. Do it, men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_614;There can be no turning back now. I'm sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_615;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_616;Because I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_617;Do it, men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_618;You have left me with little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_619;Yes, and that only proves my devotion to Odin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_620;Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_621;Let us show you how a proper human sacrifice is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_621_Aztec_Religious_Head;Your vile pantheon of gods have no power here, [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_622;This should please the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_634;It is better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_635;Better than nothing, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_636;This insult will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_637;I... how... what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_640;Let the celebrations begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_641;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_642;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_650;*hic* Letsch drrink s-schome morr... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_651;I think [From.GetSheHe] has had enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_653;UUAARGGHHHH...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_654;Those were my best trousers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_655;That could have been me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_656;Put me out, put me out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_657;That lunatic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_658;Oops...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_659;By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_661;It would seem I have a new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_664;I thought I was the only one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_669;It... it's not what it looks like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_670;By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]! You... you two were...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_602;As [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is my witness, I shan't pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_610;No, I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_611;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_612;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_613;No, I can't do this to my own brother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_614;No... not my own sister...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_615;I can't do this to my own father...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_616;I... I wouldn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_617;I can't do this... not to my own boy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_618;No, send her back... not to my girl...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_619;It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_620;No, this is too much... I can't permit it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_621;No, this brave Skræling shall live to see another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_651;*hic* I k-know thisch schong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_657;So [From.GetSheHe] is! And... and so am I! AAAHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_658;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will not be happy about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_659;Haha, you old dog! Nicely done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_670;Oh, don't mind me. Carry on, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_TOG_659;No! [From.GetFirstName], what have you done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_601;Summoned to blot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_602;Exempted from blot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_603;Your payment is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_636;Your refusal to pay is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
