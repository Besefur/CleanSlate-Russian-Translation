EVTDESC_ZE_2061A;Being a Council Member is a powerful, almost intimidating feeling. The authority, the impact of your decisions across the realm. Inside the circle of trust, so close to this unreal amount of money, one wonders - if some of the gold were to disappear, would anyone even notice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2061B;The coffers are left open and unattended again. Surely, this is [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s way of telling me that a small bonus is in order. [Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] knows the other councillors would object if it were mentioned in their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2062A;Curious, I was as pleased as always when I saw the amount of coin in the coffers this morning. But looking at it now, the amount seems somehow... less. Could it be that someone is stealing from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2062B;Going through the treasury to account for today's earnings, it seems to me that the coffers seem to contain less than what we started out with today. Either someone is stealing my gold or I must be going mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2063A;As you pass by the treasury, you stumble upon [From.GetTitledFirstName] digging through the coffers. You must have been quiet as [From.GetSheHe] looks very surprised. So this is where the missing gold has gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2063B;You close the door to your chamber, and as you approach your personal gold coffer you spot someone hiding behind it. A well aimed kick makes [From.GetTitledFirstName] squirm and the sound of what may be broken ribs accompanies [From.GetHerHis] scream of agony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2064;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] has also noticed that coins are missing but has concluded that your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledFirstName] is the only one that could've stolen it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2065;I have been caught stealing from the coffers of my Liege. But [From.GetSheHe] has been kind enough to let me go with a warning. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that I owe [From.GetHerHim] a favor, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2066;I was caught stealing from the coffers, but was fortunate enough to be let go with a warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2071;[blackmailed_target.GetTitledFirstName] has brought up a grave problem [blackmailed_target.GetSheHe] has with your [GetSpymasterName] [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName]. [job_spymaster.GetFirstName] has been using the realm's spies to go snooping about in the personal quarters of [blackmailed_target.GetFirstName] for [job_spymaster.GetHerHis] own personal gain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2075;I've received a request for additional funds from my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName]. [Root.job_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] is worried that it is too easy for spies to make their way inside your home and wants to take precautionary measures against hostile operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2078;[GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] presents a strange concoction to me. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] places a peg on my nose and forces me to drink the vile concoction while mumbling something that this will help keep away the forces that lurk in the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2080;When I walk into the office of my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] I find [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHim] carving huge and sharp stakes which [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHe] tells me will help bring down any intruder that dares to trespass. The enthusiastic smile on [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName]'s face gives me an eerie feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2081;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] told me [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHe] had something exciting to show me. I was left unimpressed when it turned out to be a vial of ordinary water. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] then told me that this 'blessed water' can drive away our enemies. The small donation demanded by the supplier had apparently already been taken care of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2083;I heard shouting down the corridor and when I came around the corner I see [spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] loudly arguing with my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName]. Clearly outraged, [spiritual.GetFirstName] explained to me that [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] tried to convince [spiritual.GetHerHim] to declare the entire building sacred ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_2076;Earlier today, my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] presented [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHis] plan to catch any sneaky spies at court. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] has weakened the floorboards in strategic places to make sure a creaking noise is always heard when someone moves around during the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_2077;As I entered the gates I was greeted by a large barking dog. My horse was frightened and started to rear. I was just about to draw my blade to slay the beast when I saw my [Root.GetSpymasterName], [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName], come running, shouting: "Bad dog! This is our friend that we're supposed to protect." The dog then stopped barking and rolled around placidly on its back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_2061;I can take some, I deserve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2062;When I catch the thieving little rat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2063;Let [From.GetHerHim] go in exchange for a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2064;Make [From.GetHerHim] swear to never do it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2065;That's fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2066;It could have been worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2071;Remove [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] from the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2075;It can't hurt to be a little safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2076;Now if only I could get rid of this terrible headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2077;Good dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2078;Eugh! My mouth reeks of garlic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2080;If it keeps us safe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2081;Expensive water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2083;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_2061;No, it's not right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2062;First they take my gold, and then what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2063;This behavior is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2064;Remove [From.GetHerHim] from the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2071;Remind [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] to act in the shadows but take no direct actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2075;It's too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2076;This is dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2077;It bit me! Get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2080;This nonsense has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2081;A great initiative!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2083;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] was just joking. I hope you understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_2071;Imply that I know secrets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2077;It bit my sister! Get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2081;This nonsense has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2083;Surely, for the correct sum this can be arranged?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2075;Start to plan defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
