EVTDESC_HL_8006;On your way towards the mountains your party runs into a small storm with heavy rain. The rain makes the earth soft and the air cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8008;On your way to the mountains, you encounter a lonely hermit. He doesn't own much besides a worn down tent, an old and sick horse, along with a few sheep. But the old man invites you to drink some salted tea with him. As you talk, you realize that you are enjoying his company!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8010;After reaching the mountains, you carefully place the body in what you deem a good location. You can already hear the vultures soaring above as you perform the necessary rituals. When you start to make your way back down, it doesn't take long until the vultures begin to tear at the flesh with both beak and claw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8011;Ever since you left the mountains, you have had the odd feeling that someone is following you. But when you turn to look, there is nothing there. But as you reach the top of a small hill, you quickly turn your head and see that one of the vultures has been following you! And not just any vulture. It's a bearded vulture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8020;You have selected a remote and secluded location for the tomb. The men are ready and waiting for your command to start digging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8022;The tomb stand completed. It sparkles with all the gold and steel within. You make sure to properly seal and cover the tomb, taking extra caution to make sure that no markings reveals its location. You kill all the workers so that no one but you, and your personal guard, know where to find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8030;The days have been agonizingly warm. Your water has almost run out. The body has already started to decompose and can be smelled from quite the distance. Yet, you haven't reached the place where the death worm is rumored to exist. The others of your party beg you to go back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8032;Finally reaching the area where the olgoi-khorkhoi are supposedly found, you feel satisfied with your achievement. You see no sign of the worm, but you are sure that it lurkers just beneath the sands! You place the body on the ground, or what's left of it, to be sacrificed to the mighty creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_8035;It was a difficult journey, but you made it home safely. Most of your party perished in the desert, and it seems that you alone were able to complete the journey without severely straining your health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Your men have already started putting on a show for the crowd. They beckon you to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_9001;With matches lasting upwards of two hours, Bökh wrestling is an excellent way to prove your endurance. You and your opponent are expected to dance as you enter and leave the contest field, and it's also expected of the winner to help the opponent up off the ground as the match is over. You know that this will require you to exert yourself to your very limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_9003;The crowd cheers as you and your opponent dance into the contest field. After circling for a while you charge in, locking yourself with the opposing wrestler. After several minutes of furious grappling you spot a weakness in your opponent's defense. You quickly let go of his upper body and grab his legs, tipping him over. He falls over and his elbows touch the ground – you are the victor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
