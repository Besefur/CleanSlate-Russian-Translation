EVTDESC_HFP_42000;My men storm the walls of [From.GetBaseName], and finally take the last proper bastion of [duchy_region.GetBaseName]. If I settled my men around the area they could probably support the ongoing Crusade and help us claim victory, but the Pope will not be pleased if I unrightfully take these lands for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42001;The [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Crusaders have taken [duchy_region.GetBaseName] and settled their soldiers around the area. Though the Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName] is still ongoing, the area around [duchy_region.GetBaseName] is indisputably in the hands of [current_crusade_beneficiary.GetTitledName].\n\nEmboldened and supported by the new [current_crusade_beneficiary.GetLordLady] of [duchy_region.GetBaseName], the Crusaders fight harder than ever to conquer [crusade_title.GetName]. It is only a matter of time before the rest of the [crusade_target_ruler.Religion.GetGroupName] realms will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42002;The old title of [old_crusade_title.GetName] has often been considered somewhat illegitimate in the eyes of everyone else. Now that I have acquired a new title it might be time to leave the old title behind, to take on the mantle of a more appropriate legitimate title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42003;The [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Crusaders have taken [duchy_region.GetBaseName] and settled their soldiers around the area. Though the Crusade is still ongoing, the area around [duchy_region.GetBaseName] is indisputably in the hands of [From.GetTitledName].\n\nDespite the continued support of [From.GetTitledName], [From.GetSheHe] has become somewhat unpopular among the other Crusaders, as [From.GetSheHe] is more interested in taking lands for [From.GetHerselfHimself] than fighting for the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42101;The [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Crusaders have taken [duchy_region.GetBaseName] and settled their soldiers around the area. Though the Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName] is still ongoing, the area around [duchy_region.GetBaseName] is indisputably in the hands of [From.GetTitledName].\n\nThe Crusaders are emboldened and supported by the selfless [From.GetDynName], who abdicated all [From.GetHerHis] old titles to settle down in [duchy_region.GetBaseName] and take the fight to the heathens. It is only a matter of time before the rest of the [crusade_target_ruler.Religion.GetGroupName] realms will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42201;As I pass through [current_location.GetName], I come across [other_crusader.GetTitledName]. [other_crusader.GetSheHeCap] invites me to spend some time in [other_crusader.GetHerHis] camp to get to know one another better, as we are allies in the Crusade for [crusade_title.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42202;The last few days here in [current_location.GetName] has been an interesting experience. The [current_location.Culture.GetName] culture has reminded me of how different these lands are to my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42203;It looks like an abandoned battlefield, the dead strewn across the landscape. The crusaders certainly met quite the resistance, here in [current_location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42204;A local merchant caravan approaches me on its way back home to [current_location.GetName]. One of the peddlers flashes me a huge grin, and ask if I want to take a look at his wares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42205;When I joined the Crusade for [new_crusade_title.GetBaseName], I never expected the loneliness and longing for home. My men look up to me, so I have to continue the facade that everything is all right, as we move ever closer to our goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42206;As we settle down for the night in [current_location.GetName], a comet passes overhead. The soldiers start talking excitedly what it might mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42207;A group of Crusaders have beheaded several of the locals in [current_location.GetName], for no other reason than them being [current_location.Religion.GetName]. Was this really why we came to [new_crusade_title.GetBaseName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42208;As we pass through [current_location.GetName], we come across a small group of [faithful_religion.GetCrusadeReligiousMinorityGroup]. They happily receive us as long lost brothers and sisters, and give us a place to sleep and rest for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42209;As I walk through the streets of [current_location.GetName], I suddenly feel someone bump into me, as a boy runs down the street. With a pouch that looks surprisingly like mine in his hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42210;After hearing about a wise man in the local area, I decide to go visit him and see what he has to offer. He starts talking about ephemeral concepts that sound like blasphemy, but I tell my men to go outside so I can hear what he has to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42211;As we travel through [current_location.GetName], we come across a festival to ancient gods still celebrated by the local populace. It reminds me of some of the harvest festivals at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42212;I wake up to the voice of what I am sure to be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] after a late night with my men. It only lasted for a second, but I am sure I was told to use all my resources to continue our righteous Crusade and help my allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42213;As we camp for the night, riders bearing the cross suddenly approach. Led by the pious [holy_order_meeting.GetTitledName], they settle down with us for the night. Just before I am going to sleep, [holy_order_meeting.GetFirstName] asks if I want to stay up and converse with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42214_A;My men and I find ourselves at a bar in [current_location.GetName], as evening turns to night. An attractive serving girl seems to pay me a lot of interest, and when I am about to go to bed for the night, she is clearly interested in joining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42214_B;My men and I find ourselves at a bar in [current_location.GetName], as evening turns to night. An attractive serving boy seems to pay me a lot of interest, and when I am about to go to bed for the night, he is clearly interested in joining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42215;I have noticed that my men seem somewhat restless these last days. Our stay in [current_location.GetName] has taken its toll on them, and they seem a bit demotivated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42220;I find myself walking through the ancient streets of Rome. Once a part of the Roman Empire, then a part of the Papal States. It used to be the very center of the world, and the core lands of the faith. Now it is not even [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42221;Once a bastion of the faith, Antioch has fallen from greatness. I look around the city and see the potential to become a center of the faith once more, it if is led by a true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42222;Once Saint Paul walked across the shores of Cyprus to spread the faith of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], but now it has been lost to the infidels. If only we could restore it as a place of faith and virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42223;Jerusalem, the beating heart of the faith, has been filled with infidels. Everywhere I look, I see men and women who are clearly not of the faith. The shame stings me to the very depths of my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42305;The bitter losses in the previous Crusade are still lingering across the Christian lands. The messengers of the Pope have traveled across all the faithful realms of the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s to spread the Crusader spirit among the people, but the nobility has tired from the previous war.\n\nWith the Pope at the forefront, small revolts have occurred as the people want to reconquer the holy places of the faith, with the lords and ladies somewhat skeptical. It is most likely only a matter of time before a larger conflict between the masses and the nobility will take place. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42307;With a bellowing shout, [shepherds_leader.GetFirstName] launches the Crusade of poor souls from [shepherds_province.GetName]. Men and women from all across the [shepherds_province.Culture.GetName] lands have gathered to witness this momentous event, with not a single lord or lady to lead them, nor to be seen among the populace.\n\nSupposedly guided by the hand of [shepherds_leader.Religion.GetHighGodName], [shepherds_leader.GetSheHe] commands the shepherds, fletchers and blacksmiths apprentices to march towards [kingdom_target.GetBaseName]. It is a long and perilous path, with many challenges waiting for them. Without supply lines nor help from the locals, they are unlikely to ever reach their destination.\n\nCan the miracles of [shepherds_leader.Religion.GetHighGodName] truly save them from the fate everyone expects them to have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42308;[From.GetFirstName] finally had [From.GetHerHis] people stand down as the losses against [FromFrom.GetTitledName] proved to be too costly. Most of the army were executed right there and then, and [From.GetFirstName] brought back to [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] to show everyone what happens to peasants who try to attack their betters.\n\nAfter all, nobody ever believed the peasants would win against the battle hardened armies of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42309;With pitchforks and hammers in hand, the shepherds rush the final bastions of defense in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]. The skeptics were many, but nobody could make the miraculous group of brave men and women stop their quest for the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nThe rest of the world looks to the new [From.GetKingQueen] with awe and confusion, as [From.GetDynName] takes the throne for [From.GetHerselfHimself]. Peasant no more, nobody can deny [From.GetHerHis] right to the throne. For who else than [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] could have guided [From.GetTitledFirstName] to victory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42310;Without the guidance of [From.GetFirstName], the men and women of the aptly named Shepherds' Crusade have started to fall apart. [From.GetHerHisCap] death broke the morale of the peasant army, and they have fled to all the corners of the world.\n\nAfter all, who ever truly believed the peasants could conquer anything on their own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42321;The massive army of peasants have gathered outside of my doorstep at [current_location.GetName]. Their commander, [shepherds_leader.GetFirstName], is asking me for aid in their Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42322;The troublemakers of the peasant Crusade have demanded that I expel all the Jews from the realm. According to their leader, [shepherds_leader.GetFirstName], they are not true believers in [shepherds_leader.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42323;As expected, the rebellious peasants of the Shepherds' Crusade have started causing chaos among the local populace of [current_location.GetName]. My people look to me, to stop these foreign elements intruding upon our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42324;As the Shepherds' Crusade passes by [current_location.GetName], I see an influx of peasants settle down in the area. It seems some of them reconsider their choices, as the Crusade still has a way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42325;After publicly declaring the Shepherds' Crusade a heretical group of pillagers, [local_bishop.GetTitledName] was executed at the hands of [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_42330;The cursed [From.Religion.GetName] peasants have entered [current_location.GetName] and have started causing issues among the people. If this keeps going, it is only a matter of time before chaos will ensue. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_42000;[duchy_region.GetBaseName] sounds like an appropriate part of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42000_TT_1;§Y[Root.GetTitledName]§! usurps all the titles in the §YDuchy of [duchy_region.GetBaseName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42000_TT_2;§YAll Pledged Crusaders§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetTitledName]§! changes by §R-20§! for §Y10§! years. §Y(Self-serving Crusader)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42001;Fight on, brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42002;I will legitimize it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42002_TT;Legitimize [old_crusade_title.GetName] as the new rightful Duchy of the region. This will delegitimize the old Duchy of [duchy_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42003;Disappointing that anyone can be so self-serving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42201;Thank you, I will accept your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42202;I should try to learn as much as I can about these lands while I still can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42203;I will bury the Crusaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42204;That thing, that looks nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42205;I have to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42206;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] guides our hand in this just war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42207;Leave some for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42208;Let me help you spread your faith, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42209;No matter, there was not a lot of money left in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42210;I will learn what he has to offer, blasphemy or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42211;Let us take part in the festivities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42212;It must be so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42213;A great opportunity for friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42214;I am not here to pick up foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42215;I will drill the men back into a fighting force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42220;A depressing twist of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42221;One day, it will live up to the name Theopolis once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42222;Sadly, the island has been lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42223;How could this be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42305;This is not going to end well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42307;Peasants? In a Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42308;As expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42309;The peasants won?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42310;As expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42321;They are free to pass through, but do it quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42322;I decide in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42323;It is probably safer to just let them pass through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42323_TT;The §RProsperity§! of §Y[current_location.GetName]§! will decrease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42324;We could always use a helping hand or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42325;[local_bishop.GetSheHeCap] brought this on [local_bishop.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_42330;It is probably just better to wait for them to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_42000;I will find a suitable ruler for this new land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42000_TT;§Y[current_crusade_beneficiary.GetTitledName]§! will become an independent §Y[current_crusade_beneficiary.GetDukeDuchessCap] of [duchy_region.GetBaseName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42001;Cursed [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42002;The title has served us well. Rest, old friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42201;I am here to fight the infidels, not to make friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42202;I will try to befriend one of the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42203;I will bury everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42204;Die, infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42205;Maybe I just need to try to relax, and stop overworking myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42206;All right, now get back to work men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42207;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] would never approve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42208;Would you like to join my court back in [Root.Capital.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42209;Let us find that kid and make him pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42210;Blasphemers must die, but libraries contain knowledge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42211;It is not befitting of a true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42212;Maybe I should not have had that much to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42213;My apologies, but it is too late for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42214;Nobody will know about just one night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42215;They just need some inspiration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42220;Rome belongs to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42220_TT;You and your men capture the city from the infidels, in an attempt to restore it to the true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42221;We will restore the city of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42221_TT;You and your men capture the city from the infidels, in an attempt to restore it to the true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_42222_TT;You and your men capture the city from the infidels, in an attempt to restore it to the true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42223;We will take Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42223_TT;You and your men capture the city from the infidels, in an attempt to restore it to the true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42307;Peasants? Pathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42321;A Crusade you say? Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42321_TT;You will ally with the Shepherds' Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42322;Maybe [shepherds_leader.GetSheHe] is right after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42323;Threading upon my lands is punishable by death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42323_TT;You will treat §Y[From.GetTitledName]§! and [From.GetHerHis] forces as a hostile entity in your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42324;Deserters have no place in [current_location.GetName], get back to the Crusade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42325;It is time to put an end to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_42330;I will fight them off myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_42000;I have no interest in these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42001;I wonder what life would have been like in [duchy_region.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42002;Legitimate or not, I will keep the title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42003;It was my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42100;I will leave [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] behind to settle down in [duchy_region.GetBaseName] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42101;I miss [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42202;Perish these blasphemous thoughts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42203;Maybe I could salvage some valuables?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42204;Thank you, but I have to be on my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42205;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] will guide me through these hardships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42206;I am blessed by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42207;Sadly, examples must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42208;Thank you for your hospitality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42209;Maybe he could be of use to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42210;Maybe [current_location.Religion.GetName] has more to offer than [Root.Religion.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42210_TT;§Y[Root.GetTitledName]§! starts secretly practicing the §Y[current_location.Religion.GetName]§! faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_42215;I make them unstoppable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42220;Maybe the [current_location.Religion.GetName] faith has more to offer us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42321;I will send you some of my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42321_TT;You send some of your soldiers to join §Y[shepherds_leader.GetFirstName]§! in [shepherds_leader.GetHerHis] Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_42325;I never really liked [local_bishop.GetFirstName] anyways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HFP_42202;I feel more [current_location.Culture.GetName] than [Root.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_42204;Hand over your valuables, peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_42206;Let us take a moment to thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for this miracle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_42220;I have to say the [current_location.Religion.GetGroupName]s have taken well care of [current_location.GetName] though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
