EVTDESC6900;There are many nobles that are good soldiers, but there are some I get along quite nicely with. This campaign has given me a true friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6901;This campaign has been proof that [From.GetTitledName] is a good person to spend time with. I value [From.GetHerHis] opinion highly, and trust [From.GetHerHim] on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6910;As I fought today, I noticed one enemy that had knocked down one of our nobles and was about to receive a killing blow. I threw myself forward and let my shield cover my comrade's body and struck a hard blow against my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6911;I thought I was going to die today, but [From.GetTitledName] saved my life. I will forever be grateful of [From.GetHerHis] actions on this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6920;It is clear that there are unkempt buffoons in the army of our liege. I simply can't stand some of them, and one individual in particular is frustrating me to no end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6921;This campaign has been proof that [From.GetTitledName] is clearly not of proper blood. I wish I would never have to meet [From.GetHerHim] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
