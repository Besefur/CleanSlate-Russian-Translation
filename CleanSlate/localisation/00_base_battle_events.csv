evt_261_desc_a;A noble has distinguished himself in this battle. Perhaps I can make use of him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC242;Alas! [Root.GetBestName] has died bravely on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC253;My commander [From.GetTitledFirstName] was cornered and slain by the enemy on the battlefield. [From.GetSheHeCap] fought bravely right until the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC255;There are less cruel people who would say that my use of unnecessary violence is appalling. Then I would remind them that this is war and war means that there are no such thing as 'unnecessary violence'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC256;I interrupted Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] while [From.GetSheHe] was interrogating an prisoner to find out where our enemy would attack next.

EVTDESC262;During the battle, you fearlessly charged ahead on horseback directly into the enemy ranks. Members of your personal guard riding beside you tumbled off their horses as enemy arrows found their marks, but your charge plowed straight into the enemy skirmishers and your sword ran red with their blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC263;While riding ahead with your personal guard, you suddenly found yourselves isolated on the battlefield and surrounded by enemy soldiers. A violent melee ensued but you gave a good account of yourself and managed to return to the main body of your army in time to lead it to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC264;You were in the thick of it during the battle, and your tally of slain enemy soldiers has impressed even the most grizzled sergeants in your army. As you clean the blood splatter off your sword and armor, the men cheer you for the bravery you displayed in securing this victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC265;Using your foot as leverage, you pull your sword out of the dead corpse of the last foeman to fall by your hand in the battle. All around you, the men are cheering as the routing enemy soldiers flee in wild panic. Victory has been achieved, in large part thanks to your heroic efforts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC266;Your commanding presence on the battlefield was felt during the recent victory, by friends and foes alike. You bolstered the spirits of the men when it was needed most, and you personally led the final charge that broke the back of the enemy army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC267;As the enemy scurries away from the battlefield like frightened rabbits, you wipe the sweat off your brow and watch in silence. It was a hard-fought melee, and you were in the thick of it, personally leading your men to victory. Not only have you won this battle, but also a great deal of respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC270;This battle has shown my true mettle. I am Brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
