EVTDESC_WOL_3002;I would do anything for the family, but it is hard work cultivating loyalty and devotion not just towards me, but between all the disparate members of our great House. When I'm gone, the harmony and stability I leave behind will be my greatest legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3003;House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] stands firm on the rock of its proud [Root.GetPatriarchMatriarch] - [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3010;I have been spending more time with my [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [target_spouse.GetFirstName] lately, and though of course we did not marry for love, I can tell it is growing between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3022;I have been making an effort to spend more time with my [target_sibling.GetRootRelation] [target_sibling.GetFirstName] lately. We have not always seen eye to eye, but as [target_sibling.GetPossPronoun] liege, it is especially important to foster loyalty and respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3022_ABROAD;I have been corresponding regularly with my [target_sibling.GetRootRelation] [target_sibling.GetFirstName], and always make sure to see [target_sibling.GetObjectPronoun] whenever I get the chance. It's a harsh world and family must stick together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3022_CHILD;My little [target_sibling.GetRootRelation] [target_sibling.GetFirstName] adores me, and I love playing with [target_sibling.GetObjectPronoun]. It is important to lay the groundwork for our future relations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3032;My [target_parent.GetRootRelation] [target_parent.GetFirstName], the [target_parent.GetAdultComplimentAdjective] [target_parent.GetManWoman], can always rely on me for aid. I try to help out whenever and however I can, out of respect, if not love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3042;It is hard to find the time, but whenever I can, I try to spend some time with my [target_child.GetRootRelation] [target_child.GetFirstName]. [target_child.GetSubjectPronounCap] must be made to see how important family is, and to honor and love [target_child.GetPossPronoun] parents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3042_ABROAD;I have been corresponding regularly with my [target_child.GetRootRelation] [target_child.GetFirstName], and always make sure to see [target_child.GetObjectPronoun] whenever I get the chance to give sage advice and remind [target_child.GetObjectPronoun] of [target_child.GetPossPronoun] duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3042_CHILD;As a reigning [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], I rarely have any spare time, but for my little [target_child.GetRootRelation] [target_child.GetFirstName] I would move heaven and earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3050;I have noticed that [target_first.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_second.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] are not on the best of terms - a situation I hope to remedy! I have invited them both for some quality family time in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3051;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has asked me to spend some quality family time in [From.Capital.Capital.GetName]. I am sure the idea is for me to become better friends with [target_second.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3052;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has asked me to spend some quality family time in [FromFrom.Capital.Capital.GetName]. I am sure the idea is for me to become better friends with [From.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3053;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused my suggestion. There will be no reconciliation with [target_second.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3054;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused my suggestion. There will be no reconciliation with [target_first.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3055;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused [target_initiator.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s invitation for us all to spend some time together in [target_initiator.Capital.Capital.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3056;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [target_initiator.GetFirstName] and I had a great time together! I feel we have really strengthened our family bonds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3057;[From.GetFirstName], [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and I had the greatest time together! I am sure they like each other better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_3060;Constant fights and vicious pranks - my two children [target_second.GetFirstName] and [target_first.GetFirstName] just could never seem to get along, but my efforts to instill mutual love and respect have finally born fruit. This friendship will serve them well when I'm gone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_3002;Hear me roar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3003;I shall be genial and well liked;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3010;Ah, marital bliss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3022;Family first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3051;That sounds nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3053;How foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3055;How silly of [From.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3056;We should do it again some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_3060;Who can you trust, if not your siblings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WOL_3003;I shall master the game of life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WOL_3051;What idiocy! I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_WOL_3003;No, I seek another lifestyle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
