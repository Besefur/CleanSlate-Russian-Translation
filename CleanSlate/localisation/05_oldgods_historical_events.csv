EVTNAME_TOG_4003;The Jomsvikings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_4001;I trust you are in good health, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. My name is Palnatoke, and I have taken it upon myself to create a brotherhood of warriors devoted to Thor and Odin. While sailing along the coast of [jomsvikings_province.GetName], I discovered the perfect site to build our stronghold and I would ask your permission to settle this land.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_4002;The Vikings under Palnatoke have finished their stronghold in [Root.Location.GetName] and the warrior brotherhood have established it as their headquarters. Henceforth the new castle shall be known as Jomsborg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_4003;A band of fierce Vikings have established a warrior brotherhood in [jomsvikings_province.GetName] along the Baltic coast. Based in a castle known as Jomsborg, these Jomsvikings are devoted to Thor, Odin and the other Norse gods. They brook no quarter on the battlefield and will permit only the strongest and ablest warriors amongst their number.\n\nThough there are those who would dismiss them as simple brigands, the Jomsvikings have vowed to defend all Norse lands being encroached by Christendom or other foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_4001;By all means, build your castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_4002;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_4003;Their place in Valhalla is assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_4003;Let us hope those zealots steer clear of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_TOG_4001;No, I want no troublemakers in my land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_400;New land has been sighted across the sea to the west of Iceland! While sailing to Reykjavik from Norway, Gunnbjørn Ulfsson and his crew were blown off course and came upon several skerries lying off the coast of a much larger island – possibly a new continent.\n\nWhile Gunnbjørn did not go ashore, the land seems to be unclaimed and unsettled. Sailors in Iceland have vowed to investigate this discovery further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_401;The new land discovered to the west of Iceland does indeed seem to be a new island. Under the leadership of Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for murder, settlers have claimed land on the island's southwestern shores. To attract more colonists, Erik has cleverly decided on the promising name of Greenland for this untamed, virgin land.\n\nThe new colony has already started exporting walrus ivory, seal blubber and furs to Iceland and beyond. Apart from the brave Norse settlers, Greenland so far seems to be devoid of human life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_402;After hearing stories of new land even further west of Greenland, Leif Eriksson, the son of Erik the Red, has mounted an expedition with a single longship and a crew of thirty-five. Days were spent at sea, but Leif and his crew finally sighted land and traveled south along the coast until they decided to winter at a place he named Vinland. When they returned to Greenland, the brave explorers brought with them a cargo of grapes and some much needed timber.\n\nUpon Leif's return, his brother Thorvald departed on a similar expedition to further map the coastline of this new land, but his shore party came to blows with Skrælings, the local natives, and Thorvald himself fell in battle. Despite this, future expeditions are already being planned to this rich and fertile land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_403;Grave news from beyond the western sea! The explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni sailed towards Vinland with three full longships, intending to establish a permanent settlement in the new world. Sadly, while sailing further south along the coast of Vinland, they came upon a large party of heavily armed Skræling warriors.\n\nThe Skrælings butchered the Norsemen and captured two of the three longships. Thorfinn himself was apparently sacrificed to their vengeful gods, but a few of his men were released so that they could bring warning back to Greenland. According to the survivors, the Skrælings then sailed the captured ships south, towards the cities of their great realm, where our ship-building techniques will be studied by their learned men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_404;Iceland, despite its ominous name, has proven to be quite fertile. Up until this point only a few hermits inhabited the island, though this is no longer the case. Many [settler_of_iceland_target.Culture.GetName] settlers are now flocking to its coasts, sponsored with ships and building materials by [settler_of_iceland_target.GetFullName], in search of a new life. [left_iceland_target.GetFullName] and [left_iceland_target.GetHerHis] followers have left the island in disgust, returning south to their ancestral homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
