EVTDESC_MNM_1750;Many years of my life have been spent dedicated to [This.Society.GetName] â€“ performing missions and tasks in the interests of the Order and its [Root.GetSocietyRank]. Today all that effort has been rewarded, as I have become the new [Root.GetSocietyRank]. My fellows now look to me for leadership and guidance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6992;Your mission "[Root.GetQuestName]" involving [From.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer valid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10000;Honored [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby grant you permission to advance to the next rank within [Root.Society.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[my_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [my_grandmaster.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10019;You no longer fulfill the requirements for joining [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10020_A;They are all staring at me, whispering behind my back! As I turn my head towards them, they look away, but I am sure of it. They know. Perhaps not the specifics, but they know. They will come for me, any day now. Being one of [Root.Society.GetName] always felt worth the risk, but I am not so sure anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10020_B;Some days, I think I am going insane. It is probably all in my head, but sometimes I notice people staring at me. When my courtiers whisper it is impossible to shake the suspicion that it might be about me. Being one of [Root.Society.GetName] always felt worth the risk, but I am not so sure anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10023_ASSASSINS;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you no longer adhere to the true faith. As defending the Shia Religion and its followers is the reason why exist, our foremost duty, this is an act of the highest degree of treachery. If you want to keep your life, never cross our path again. \n\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10023_fallback;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you do not live up to the standards expected of our members. While we wish you no ill, we can no longer allow you to proclaim yourself one of [Root.Society.GetName].\n\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_MNM_10023_HERMETICS;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you do not live up to the standards expected of our members. While we encourage you to continue your search for knowledge and truth wherever you go, we can no longer include you in our community.\n\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10023_MO;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you no longer adhere to the true faith. While we hope you will realize your grave error and return to [expeller.Religion.GetHighGodName], we cannot be lenient. You are banned from [expeller.Society.GetName].\n\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10023_SR_A;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you have publicly embraced the [expeller.TrueReligion.GetName] faith. While your devotion is admirable, it has put you in a perilous position and we can no longer remain in contact with you.\n\n[expeller.GetSRFarewell],\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10023_SR_B;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to our attention that you no longer adhere to the true faith. While we hope you will realize the grave errors of your ways and return to [expeller.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], we cannot be lenient. We must protect our own. If you betray our secrets, we will drag you down with us.\n\nSigned, [expeller.GetSocietyRank] [expeller.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10024;[From.GetName] has fallen out of favor and no longer has any members. I have therefore decided to become the new founder and leader of this Society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10042;While carrying out my duties for [Root.Society.GetName], I have met [potential_rival.GetSocietyRank] [potential_rival.GetFirstName] on several occasions. These encounters have never ended well. One would be hard-pressed to find a more unsympathetic character! I suspect [potential_rival.GetSheHe] is spreading lies behind my back to damage my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10045;I have encountered [potential_friend.GetSocietyRank] [potential_friend.GetFirstName] many times while carrying out my duties for [Root.Society.GetName], and it is always a pleasant occasion. We can talk for hours, if the time allows, because [potential_friend.GetSheHe] never bores me. While our discussions are often lengthy, we always seem to agree on the matters which are most important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_1750;And leadership and guidance I shall provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10000;It is my privilege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10020;How long before I crack under the pressure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10023;Seems like I made some enemies today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10023_less_hostile;I had a feeling it would come to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10024;It will be glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10042;I will confront [potential_rival.GetFirstName] and reveal [potential_rival.GetHerHis] dishonest ways to the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_10045;I think this is friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_10024;No, this is not what I had in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_10042;I must be patient, it will surely pay off in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_10045;I am probably reading too much into this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNM_10045;Or it might be more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MNM.6662.a;But I enjoy them so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.6662.d;It could be that I am using the powers of [Root.Society.GetName] too freely, people are becoming suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.6664.d;I have not called upon the powers of [Root.GetDWDevil] for some time, people have become less suspicious of my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.6668.d;You have not exactly been discreet as of late - frequent and often times blatant use of [Root.Society.GetName]'s powers without any concern for secrecy has caused the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s to openly accuse you of apostasy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
