EVTDESC_JD_7000;Your messengers tell of a traveler who recently arrived in [tavern_location.GetName]. The traveler, a [traveling_teacher.Culture.GetName] Scholar by the name of [traveling_teacher.GetFullName], is apparently requesting an audience. [traveling_teacher.GetSheHeCap] claims to be a renowned teacher, willing to impart [traveling_teacher.GetHerHis] knowledge to one of your children!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_7001;The traveling teacher bows before you and says: 'I humbly greet the [Root.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [Root.GetFirstName] of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]! My name is [traveling_teacher.GetFullName], and I come with an offer. For a modest sum I would be willing to impart one of my many skills to your [child_to_be_taught.GetDaughterSon] [child_to_be_taught.GetFirstName], for I am a scholar of both Confucian classics and surgery!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_7010;A well-dressed merchant has requested an audience. The [radhanite_merchant.GetManWoman] presents [radhanite_merchant.GetHerselfHimself] as [radhanite_merchant.GetMasterMistress] [radhanite_merchant.GetFullName], a representative of the Jewish Radhanite merchants, and implores: 'We are seeking to set up an office in [radhanite_location.GetName], but lack the funds. If you would sponsor us, we would be eternally grateful!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10011;My [adventurous_spirit.GetRootRelation] [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName] has offered to travel to the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName], on a mission to bring glory to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. 'Please, my [Root.GetLordLady]', [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] says. 'Let a humble servant strengthen your relations with the [the_protector_general.Offmap.Ruler.GetShortChineseEmperorName]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10013;One morning I wake up before my guards have attempted to rouse me. I hear excited chatter coming from the main hall, and as I open the [Root.GetChamberOpening] there is a bustle of servants filling the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. '[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the court of the [the_protector_general.GetTitle]!' they gossip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10014;'The [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] is a fascinating place, my [Root.GetLordLady]' [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] says, as I turn the foreign coins over in my hand. [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHeCap] arrived this morning, and besides the obvious souvenirs, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] comes carrying many a tale from [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels – everyone in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] wants to know everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10015;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] returned to [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] late last night, seemingly exhausted from the journey. Today, during the briefing, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] simply appears relieved to be home again. Just as I begin to worry about the impression [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] must have made throughout [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] offers me a sealed letter of greeting from the [the_protector_general.GetTitle] [the_protector_general.GetHerselfHimself]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10016;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName] has returned from [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels. When my council inquire about [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] impressions of the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] lets out an exasperated sigh. Then [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] unleashes a tirade about [adventurous_spirit.GetNegativeChineseConvoTopic].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10017;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName] has finally returned from the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName]! However, when asked about [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] adventures, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] just mutters, mostly about [adventurous_spirit.GetNegativeChineseConvoTopic].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10018;On the eve of [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] return from the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName], [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName] and I discuss at length [adventurous_spirit.GetChineseConvoTopic].\n'I'd also like to introduce you to someone', [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] says, smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10019;There is something different about [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] – as we discuss [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels to the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] speaks passionately about [adventurous_spirit.GetChineseConvoTopic]. 'Oh, my [Root.GetLordLady]. You must let me go back', [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] pleads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10020;When I first did not hear anything from [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName], I simply assumed that [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] journey back home had been delayed. Sadly, I have now formally received word from [the_protector_general.GetTitledName] of [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] passing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10023_death;During [From.GetHerHis] visit, [From.GetTitledName], the [From.GetJobTitle] sent from [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName], has died. While it is a tragedy, it also puts me in the awkward position of having to inform the [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitle] about how the [From.GetJobTitle]'s diplomatic visit is canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10023_missing;During [From.GetHerHis] visit, [From.GetTitledName], the [From.GetJobTitle] sent from [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName], has gone missing! I am not sure how to phrase the letter to the Protector General, but this obviously means that [From.GetHerHis] visit is canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10023_prison;During [From.GetHerHis] visit, [From.GetTitledName], on a diplomatic mission from [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName], has been imprisoned! I am not sure how to phrase the letter to the Protector General, but this obviously means that [From.GetHerHis] visit is canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10032_A;A nervous foreigner has shown up at court. Flinching at anyone who comes near [chinese_refugee.GetHerHim], the [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] refuses to be on [chinese_refugee.GetHerHis] way, instead arguing that [chinese_refugee.GetSheHe] could serve me, as the trained [chinese_refugee.GetChineseProfession] [chinese_refugee.GetSheHe] is. "Just don't send me back out there. I cannot go back", [chinese_refugee.GetSheHe] says, jaw clenched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10032_B;My guards have dragged a Chinese thief before me. "[chinese_refugee.GetSheHeCap] claims to have an audience scheduled with you, my [Root.GetLordLady]", they report. "Please, forgive the ruse", the [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] urges in a heavy accent, voice thick with emotion. "I'm a [chinese_refugee.GetChineseProfession] – any Chinese court would be ecstatic to have me! Take pity on my soul, [Root.GetMasterMistress].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10032_C;A suspected spy has tried to enter [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] tonight, stopped only by guards who spotted the glint of armor under [chinese_refugee.GetHerHis] cloak. When confronted, the foreigner claims to be a [chinese_refugee.GetChineseProfession], fleeing the [offmap_china.GetFullName]. Upon inspection, I notice [chinese_refugee.GetHerHis] worn expression, and an armor not only covered in dust, but dark stains of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_10032_D;A Chinese healer has taken shelter in a small village outside of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName], supposedly treating people in exchange for food, and successfully so. My courier first thought the [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] a beggar, but rumor has it [chinese_refugee.GetSheHe] comes fleeing the current situation in the [offmap_china.GetFullName]. "It would explain [chinese_refugee.GetHerHis] ragtag appearance, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20002_A;[Root.GetCouncillorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nTo strengthen the relationship between our nations, my [chinese_guest.Liege.GetMasterMistress] has sent me on a mission to your demesne. It would honor me to visit your court and [chinese_guest.GetCGMission].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20002_B;[Root.GetCouncillorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nTo further solidify the bonds between our nations and ensure peaceful cooperation, my [chinese_guest.Liege.GetMasterMistress] has sent me on a mission to your demesne. I shall visit your court and [chinese_guest.GetCGMission].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20004;After a tour of [Root.Capital.GetName] and a fortnight at my court, [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName]'s visit has reached its end. Thanks to the meticulous preparations made by my [corresponding_councilor.GetJobTitle], [corresponding_councilor.GetTitledFirstName], everything went smoothly. The [From.GetJobTitle] has returned home with [From.GetCGMissionOutcome] for [From.GetHerHis] [From.Liege.GetMasterMistress].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20005;As the welcoming feast ends, [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName] and I retreat to finish our conversation in private, observing the moon from the [Root.Capital.Capital.GetHolding] walls. Suddenly, bright lights streak across the sky, and the [From.GetJobTitle]'s visage turns ashen. 'Bad omen,' mutters the translator and the two [From.GetMenWomen] make a hasty departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20005_B;As the welcoming feast ends, [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName] and I retreat to finish our conversation in private, observing the moon from the [Root.Capital.Capital.GetHolding] walls. Suddenly, bright lights streak across the sky, and the [From.GetJobTitle]'s visage turns ashen. 'Bad omen,' [From.GetSheHe] mutters, before making a hasty departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20006;The preparations for [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName]'s arrival tomorrow are well under way, but I find myself pondering what more I could do to make [From.GetHerHim] feel welcome. Even though a proficient translator has been summoned, would it not be a nice gesture for me to greet [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] native tongue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20007;I asked the translator to not only instruct me in the proper pronunciation, but also teach me the grammar and meaning behind the words. It took many hours, but the pleased look on [FromFrom.GetJobTitle] [FromFrom.GetDynName]'s [FromFrom.GetFaceDescription] face as I greet [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in flawless Chinese proves that it was worth the effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20008;'My [Root.GetLordLady], please wake up!' I sit up with a start. Where am I? My eyes dart around the room. The library! 'The guests are waiting! Forgive me, my [Root.GetLordLady], we didn't know where you were. We've been searching the [Root.Capital.Capital.GetHolding] for hours!' I bury my face in my hands. I have not yet received my guests, and the visit is already a disaster...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20009;I spent an hour reading the greeting which the translator had prepared for me before going to bed, and as I dressed this morning, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was there to help me with the pronunciation. I have no idea what the elaborate phrases mean, but at least they come out somewhat smoothly as I greet [FromFrom.GetJobTitle] [FromFrom.GetDynName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20010;I spent an hour reading the greeting which the translator had prepared for me before going to bed. However, as I stood before [FromFrom.GetJobTitle] [FromFrom.GetDynName] this morning, it was as if someone had wiped the words from my mind! I forgot every other word and stuttered something awful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20011;I had my servant buy an exquisite garb of Chinese silk with the proper accessories in preparation for [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName]'s arrival. However, as I welcomed [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] entourage, the sight of my new robe seemed to displease [From.GetHerHim]! Later, the translator told me I wore several attributes exclusive to the [From.Liege.Offmap.Ruler.GetTitle]'s family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20012;As I am walking in the gardens with my guest [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName] I comment on the sunny skies. The translator repeats my words and after a moment of thought, [From.GetDynName] replies with ardent enthusiasm. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] thinks my pleasantries are a metaphor for the enlightened nature of the heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_20012_B;As I am walking in the gardens with my guest [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName] I comment on the sunny skies. After a moment of thought, [From.GetDynName] replies with ardent enthusiasm. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] thinks my pleasantries are a metaphor for the enlightened nature of the heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_30002;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nIt has come to the attention of the heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetShortChineseEmperorName] that merchants from your lands have been acting with deceit and dishonesty while conducting trade with our merchants. We are certain that you will make sure that this behavior will cease immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_30003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has reprimanded merchants in our region, citing misconduct in other realms. However, there are those arguing that the rights of merchants from [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] does not fall under the jurisdiction of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While it might anger the [From.GetTitle], I am considering a public show of resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_30004;Your vassal, [From.GetTitledFirstName], was less than impressed by your intrusion on merchant rights in the cities of [From.GetHerHis] lands. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now made a public statement on how this action was an unjustified use of power in an area of [From.GetHerHis] responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_30011;Last night, [chinese_courtier.GetBestName] and I ended up having discussions until dawn, about [chinese_courtier.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. I must have made a good impression, as [chinese_courtier.GetSheHe] told me that [chinese_courtier.GetSheHe] will be sending a letter, praising the hospitality [chinese_courtier.GetSheHe] has received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_30012;I have noticed that [chinese_courtier.GetBestName] has grown increasingly aggravated during the last couple of weeks, and today something extra unthoughtful slipped my tongue which caused [chinese_courtier.GetHerHim] to storm off exclaiming that the Emperor would hear about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40001_A;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has decreed that it is in the [offmap_china.GetName]'s interests that a new, vibrant city be established on the trade routes to the West. This would be a feat worthy of favourable trade agreements, as well as [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] personal notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40001_C;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has decreed that it is in the [offmap_china.GetName]'s interests to bestow favourable trade agreements on the [Root.GetTitle] most worthy of such association. They may well also find themselves blessed with [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] personal appreciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40005_A;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice your efforts in the creation of the city of [trade_competition_new_city.GetName]. To show [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] appreciation [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHeCap] has decided to grant you preferential treatment in trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40005_B;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice [trade_competition_city_winner.GetName]'s efforts in the creation of the city of [trade_competition_new_city.GetName]. Your own failure to encourage trade with the West, however, have not gone unnoticed either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40007;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most displeased to find no efforts have been made to erect a new center of trade upon the trade routes with the West. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] disappointment with his chosen [Root.GetTitle]s is great, and this failure will not soon be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40009_A;Pleasant rumors from the [offmap_china.GetName] have reached my court that I am being considered the most worthy among those competing for the Emperor's favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40009_B;Rumors from the [offmap_china.GetName] have reached my court that [trade_competition_halftime_winner.GetTitledName] is being considered the most worthy among those competing for the Emperor's favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40011_A;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice the esteem you command among your peers. To show [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] appreciation [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHeCap] has decided to grant you preferential treatment in trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40011_B;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice the esteem [trade_competition_city_winner.GetName] commands among [trade_competition_city_winner.GetHerHis] peers. Your own lacking prestige, however, has not gone unnoticed either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40011_C;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice the esteem you command among your peers. To show [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHisCap] appreciation [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHeCap] has decided to grant you a rare [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_JD_40011_D;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] has been most pleased to notice the esteem you command among your peers. Know that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName] thinks very highly of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60011;The [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitle] of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] addresses a letter to the traitorous [Root.GetTitle] of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nThe heavenly [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], wishes for you to understand that [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] can not tolerate such a lack of honor or loyalty from [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] Tributaries.\nYour actions will be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60016;With the death of [From.GetBestName] you are free from your status as a tributary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70002;A noble by the name of [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName] came to court today seeking asylum. [escaped_chinese_noble.GetSheHeCap] claims to have escaped from China after the rest of [escaped_chinese_noble.GetHerHis] family was executed on orders of the Emperor. "Oh great [Root.GetTitle], your merciful nature is known across the land. I implore you to grant me refuge. It would be an untold kindness!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70003;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\n It has come to the attention of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] that you are harboring an enemy of the [offmap_china.GetName]. If [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName] is not returned at once [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetFullName] will be most displeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70004;Despite [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName]'s fears, no emissaries of the Chinese Emperor came looking for [escaped_chinese_noble.GetHerHim]. "The time has come for me to leave. I will never forget your kindness, please take this as a token of my gratitude.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70005;Soon after writing to the Chinese Emperor, a very grateful emissary arrived with several guards to escort [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName] back to the Chinese Empire. "You can't understand what they'll do to me!" screamed [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFirstName] as [escaped_chinese_noble.GetSheHe] was dragged out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70008;Soon after writing to the Chinese Emperor, an emissary arrived with several guards however [escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName] had escaped the night before! Someone must have warned [escaped_chinese_noble.GetHerHim]. All the emissary said before he left was: "The Emperor will be... displeased";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_70009;[escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName] was found dead in [escaped_chinese_noble.GetHerHis] room this morning, strangled to death with a length of the finest Chinese Silk. The killer was nowhere to be found but I'm sure I know who is responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_7000;Intriguing, bring [traveling_teacher.GetHerHim] to court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_7000_TT;You invite the traveling teacher to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_7001;Hm, can you teach [child_to_be_taught.GetHerHim] how to read faster?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_7010;More trade is a good thing, I shall sponsor you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_7010_TT;The Radhanite merchants set up a rudimentary trade office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10011;What a brilliant idea! Go, with my blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10011_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! lights up like the sun, before rushing off to pack [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] belongings.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10013;And [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] comes bearing gifts? Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10013_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is proud to bring souvenirs from the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10014;Bear with us, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName], as my scribes collect all your stories...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10014_TT;The journey of §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] was a success!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10015;Not a complete failure then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10016;This is not what I had hoped for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10016_TT;You lose a bit of grace.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10017;I should have sent someone else in [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]'s stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10017_TT;You lose some grace.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10018;Oh, how lovely! Welcome to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10018_TT;A [new_found_lover.GetManWoman] named §Y[new_found_lover.GetTitledName]§! joins your court.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019;If this is what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019_imbecile;I'm not sure I follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019_lunatic;What, you want to live there?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_10019_TT_solo;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! will leave your court forever.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10020;At least the Protector General offers [the_protector_general.GetHerHis] condolences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10020_TT;Perhaps [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] at least enjoyed [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] last days abroad.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10023;I shall have my scribes compose a letter to the [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10032;You may stay. The [offmap_china.GetFullName] is no place for anyone right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10032_TT;The Chinese [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] joins your court.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20002;The servants of the [chinese_guest.Liege.GetTitle] are always welcome in my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20002_TT;The [chinese_guest.GetJobTitle] of §Y[chinese_guest.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]§!, §Y[chinese_guest.GetTitle]§!, will pay a visit to your demesne.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_20006_FAILURE_TT;you falling asleep while studying, causing you to be late to the audience tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20006_SUCCESS_TT;a successful night of study. Your greeting tomorrow will be impeccable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20007;Language holds more power than most [Root.GetMenWomen] understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20007_TT;You have impressed your guest, and [chinese_guest.GetTitledName] returns home, most pleased. §Y[FromFrom.Liege.GetTitle] [FromFrom.Liege.GetDynName]§! will hear about your hospitality.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_20009_TT;§Y[FromFrom.GetJobTitle] [FromFrom.GetDynName]§! appreciates your efforts, and soon returns home to §Y[FromFrom.Liege.GetTitle] [FromFrom.Liege.GetDynName]§! with a positive report.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20010;I have never been so mortified!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20010_TT;You made a fool of yourself in front of your guest, and §Y[FromFrom.GetJobTitle] [FromFrom.GetDynName]§! returns home, offended.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20011;Guards! Find me the merchant responsible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20011_tt;§Y[From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName]§! returns home offended. [From.GetHerHisCap] [From.Liege.GetMasterMistress], §Y[From.Liege.GetTitle] [From.Liege.GetDynName]§!, will surely hear of this.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20012;I never knew talking about the weather could be so fruitful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_20012_tt;§Y[From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetDynName]§! returns home, having interpreted your polite comment about the weather as an elegant compliment to the §Y[offmap_china.Ruler.GetMediumChineseEmperorName]§!. Words of your wisdom and eloquence are sure to reach [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] ears!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30002;We need to restrict the privileges of the major trade guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30003;I'll make a public statement about [From.GetHerHis] blatant misuse of power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30004;[From.GetHerHisCap] merchants had to be kept in line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30011;A pleasant evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_30012;This might upset our relations with [offmap_china.Governor.Offmap.GetShortName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA_JD_40001;I doubt that failure is an option...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA_JD_40005;Ah, to be recognized by the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA_JD_40007;Alas! Woe be unto us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA_JD_40009;Of course I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_60011;They do not scare us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70002;Of course you are welcome to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70002_TT;You allow §Y[escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName]§! to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70003;I suppose we better return [escaped_chinese_noble.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70003_TT;§Y[offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName]§! receives a letter with your reply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70004;I will treasure it always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70004_TT;§Y[escaped_chinese_noble.GetFirstName]§! leaves your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70005;I'm sure it can't be that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70008;What a fool I look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_70009;I should have known you cannot escape the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_JD_7000;I do not have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_7000_TT;You are not interested and turn the traveling teacher away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_7001;I want you to teach [child_to_be_taught.GetHerHim] the Confucian classics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_7010;We should discuss my patronage over... dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10011;I think [back_up_target_1.GetTitledFirstName] is better suited for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10011_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! looks disappointed, as §Y[back_up_target_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! is ordered to go in [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] stead.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10018;You invited a stranger to our [Root.GetCapitalHolding]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10018_TT;You gain some grace. §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is not pleased.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10019;Out of the question, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]! You belong here in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10019_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is not pleased.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10023;The [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitle] will find out eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_10032;This is not a criminal, you buffoons. [chinese_refugee.GetSheHeCap]'s a refugee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_20002;I have no time to entertain guests at present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_20002_TT;Your refusal is a great insult to §Y[chinese_guest.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]§! and [chinese_guest.Liege.GetHerHis] [chinese_guest.GetJobTitle] §Y[chinese_guest.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_20006;An hour or two to prepare a simple greeting should suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_20006_FAILURE_TT;you making a flawed attempt at the greeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_20006_SUCCESS_TT;you making a good attempt at the greeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_30002;I'll have [target_marshal.GetFirstName] seek out and deal with the worst troublemakers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_30003;I should make sure that I'm in good standing with [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_30011;I need to make sure that everyone knows about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_30012;Guards arrest that [chinese_courtier.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB_JD_40005;I must try harder next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB_JD_40009;I must work harder to be deserving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_70002;I dare not anger the dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_70002_TT;You send §Y[escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName]§! away to avoid angering the Chinese Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_70003;I'm not scared of the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_70003_TT;§Y[offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName]§! receives a letter with your reply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_JD_7000;Bring [traveling_teacher.GetHerHim] over for a secluded dinner...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_7000_TT;You invite the teacher over for a private, secluded dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_7001;The basics of surgery and poetry sound useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_7010;A shoddy office will not do, you shall govern [radhanite_location_barony.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_7010_TT;Offer the Radhanites the city of [radhanite_location_barony.GetName], this will displease the vassal who currently resides there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10011;I'm sorry, but [back_up_target_2.GetTitledFirstName] would give a better impression of us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10011_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! looks disappointed, as §Y[back_up_target_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! is ordered to go in [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] stead.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10019;Oh, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]. Surely, you don't mean that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10019_TT;You gain some grace. §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! will get over it.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10032;I can make use of a veteran like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_20006;How fortunate that I already know the basics of the language!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_20006_TT;As you are multilingual, you greet the visitor flawlessly.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_30002;How our merchants conduct their trade is no business for the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_70002;Was there some kind of reward on your head?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JD_70002_TT;You allow §Y[escaped_chinese_noble.GetFullName]§! to stay and secretly send a letter letting the Emperor know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_JD_7001;My [child_to_be_taught.GetDaughterSon] is dull and apathetic, could you inspire [child_to_be_taught.GetHerHis] curiosity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_7010;I am sorry, but I have no gold to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_7010_TT;You are not interested and turn the Radhanite merchant away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10011;Absolutely not! You are needed here, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10011_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! looks disappointed.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10019;But... How can you ask me to send you away again, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10019_TT;This option is available due to the high opinion §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName]§! has of you.\n\nYour [adventurous_spirit.GetRootRelation] bows [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] head in shame, assuring you that [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] will remain at court.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10032;Why wasn't I told sooner? We need a physician here in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_20006;It would be unwise. I cannot hope to rival the translator's skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JD_20006_TT;You do not risk embarrassing yourself and let the translator do their job. §Y[chinese_guest.GetTitledName]§! returns home.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_JD_7001;What you are asking is outrageous, begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_1;Surely this [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] can find shelter elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_1_TT;You send the [chinese_refugee.GetManWoman] away.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_2;This is a waste of my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_3;I'm sorry, but we can hardly afford to feed our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_4;I'm sure [chinese_refugee.GetSheHe] wants to be left alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JD_10032_4_TT;You let the refugee be.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
