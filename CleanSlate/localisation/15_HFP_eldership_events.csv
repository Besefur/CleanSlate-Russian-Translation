EVTDESCHFP24001;I may not be as strong and sprightly as I once was, but I have a duty to keep sharing my wisdom and advice to the brash, young members of [Root.Capital.GetName], thus ensuring the prosperity of my tribe. Somebody must tell these kids all the things that they are doing wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to appear unannounced at my court this morning, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is pleased by my leadership and that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to follow my progress as [Root.GetTitle] more closely, while providing me with [From.GetHerHis] priceless advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24005;After a long period of constant fights, [From.GetTitledFirstName] finally decided to leave me and my court in peace. Unfortunately, [From.GetSheHe] is now wandering through the realm, warning all the other esteemed Elders of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] about my allegedly poor treatment of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24006;[scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] might be a good and wise ruler, but [scoped_ruler.GetSheHe] often has a hard time when it comes to spotting talent amongst [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] people. Luckily for [scoped_ruler.GetHerHim], I am here to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24010;It is quite clear that [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] is too inexperienced and foolish to handle all [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] responsibilities as [scoped_ruler.GetTitle]. Luckily for [scoped_ruler.GetHerHim], I am here to help [scoped_ruler.GetHerHim] find someone skilled enough to share [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24017;It has been a few weeks now since [From.GetTitledFirstName] started to claim I would make a wonderful [Root.GetTitle] for [scoped_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. It seems the old [From.GetManWoman] is fed up with [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]'s lack of respect and would be ready to legitimize me as [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] successor, should I decide to depose [scoped_ruler.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24018;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been going around [Root.Capital.GetName] praising [From.GetFirstName], claiming that [From.GetSheHe] would make a much better [Root.GetTitle] than I do. Perhaps I should have not treated the Elder so poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24021;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been going around [Root.Capital.GetName] for a few days now, praising me as one of the wisest rulers [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has seen in decades. Knowing that one of the oldest, most esteemed people in the realm supports me so openly has undoubtedly increased my standing amongst all vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP24023;Having long since recognized me as a ruler worthy of praise and respect, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to dedicate some of [From.GetHerHis] dwindling time to share a spec of [From.GetHerHis] ancient wisdom with me, so that I may pass it down to my own descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP24007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been pestering me from some time now about how [scoped_potential_count.GetFirstName] would be a model vassal if only I gave [scoped_potential_count.GetHerHim] a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24008;It took me some time to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of [scoped_potential_count.GetFirstName]'s clear potential, but I was able to get my way in the end. I am certain my [GetFromRelation] will not have reason to regret [From.GetHerHis] decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24009;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to ignore my words. I cannot believe that [From.GetSheHe] would so easily dismiss the council of one of the elders of [From.GetHerHis] realm. Such a shortsightedness should never be tolerated in leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24011;As if having to regularly deal with [From.GetHerHis] inane prattling was not enough, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been tormenting me from some time now about the necessity of sharing my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] with one of [From.GetHerHis] spineless sycophants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24012;For once, it appears I have been able to instill some wisdom in [From.GetFirstName]'s thick skull. After a long and lively discussion, the [From.GetTitle] has finally decided to give into my demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24013;It was too much of me to expect that [From.GetFirstName] would listen to reason now after ignoring my council for so long. The stubborn [From.GetTitle] has rebuked my suggestion again and again, too shortsighted and proud to admit the merit of my argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP24015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been complaining for some time now about how nobody listens to [From.GetHerHim] anymore and that we all should show more respect and bear more attention to an esteemed elder of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. In truth, I believe [From.GetSheHe] just feels lonely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHFP24007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been pestering me from some time now about how I should share some of my responsibilities with [From.GetHerHim] if I wish to see our people prosper, yet I cannot shake the feeling that [From.GetSheHe] just wishes to own more land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP24008;It took me some time to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I am still perfectly capable of administering more land and that granting me a new title would be merely in the interest of a prosperous [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but I was able to get my way in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP24011;As if having to regularly deal with [From.GetHerHis] inane prattling was not enough, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been tormenting me from some time now about the necessity of sharing my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] with [From.GetHerHim] by granting the old [From.GetManWoman] direct control over one of my provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP24001;I am not going anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24003;Of course you are welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24005;I assure you, [From.GetSheHe] has always been impossible to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24006;You need only to look at [scoped_recipient_first.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24007;Fine! Whatever you say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24008;The words of a wise [Root.GetManWoman] are hard to dismiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24009;What a foolish and impertinent child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24010;One cannot deny [scoped_recipient_first.GetFirstName] has a... sparkle, of sorts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24011;Whatever will make you shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24012;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is not so bad a [From.GetTitle] after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24013;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24015;I will make sure you are not neglected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24017;That is something to think about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24018;Curse that resentful, old fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24021;I have always been fond of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP24023;Tell me of the customs of our ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP24003;Who do you think you are, old [From.GetManWoman]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24005;At least we will have some quiet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24006;[scoped_recipient_second.GetFirstName]'s reputation is impeccable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24007;I am the [Root.GetTitle], not you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24010;[scoped_recipient_second.GetFirstName] is truly a likable fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24011;It will never happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24015;I know exactly what you need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP24023;You must have watched over many rulers in your time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP24006;[scoped_recipient_third.GetFirstName] is the most competent [scoped_recipient_third.GetManWoman] I can think of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP24010;[scoped_recipient_third.GetFirstName]'s potential is sure to blossom... eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP24015;There must be something I can do to help you feel better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP24023;I would like to know more about our people's legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP24006;Then again, maybe there is a lack of talent around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP24010;Then again, maybe [scoped_ruler.GetSheHe] is better off alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP24015;Wait... [From.GetFirstName] is still alive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHFP24006;There is but one person fit for this job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHFP24010;Clearly, I need to take charge personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
