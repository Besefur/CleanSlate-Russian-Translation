EVTDESC_HF_10004;We have an eager new recruit! I should let the [new_recruit.GetManWoman] know that [new_recruit.GetSheHe] needs prove [new_recruit.GetHerselfHimself] to [new_recruit.GetHerHis] new peers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10005;[hero_character.GetTitledName] of [hero_character.Society.GetName] greets me with a brief nod. "Another recruit, huh? To join our ranks, you need to prove yourself, [Root.GetBoyGirl]", the [hero_character.GetManWoman] says gruffly, folding [hero_character.GetHerHis] arms across [hero_character.GetHerHis] chest. "You'd be fighting one of our own. Still interested, my [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10005_bloodline;[hero_character.GetTitledName] of [hero_character.Society.GetName] eyes me up and down, first skeptically, but then [hero_character.GetHerHis] posture relaxes. "Say, my [Root.GetLordLady]... Are you related to [founder_target.GetTitledFirstName]?". I nod, smiling. "That [founder_target.GetManWoman] is a legend!" [hero_character.GetSheHe] laughs. "I look forward to seeing you in action", [hero_character.GetSheHe] adds, squeezing my shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10006_no;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] listened while I explained our tradition of one-on-one duels, but then rolled [new_recruit.GetHerHis] eyes and walked off. "I would rather not get involved with barbarians.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10006_yes;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] offered no protests when I explained our traditions, eyes all aglitter at the thought of an initiation duel. After some inquiry, [duel_target.GetTitledName] has kindly volunteered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_fled;Just as [combatant_2.GetTitledName] was about to show [From.GetTitledName] what sparring match should look like, the [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman] dropped [From.GetHerHis] weapon and ran..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_succeeded_greatly;Although I did not expect much, we were all stunned by the performance of [From.GetBestName] during [From.GetHerHis] initiation fight. It will be interesting to see what [From.GetSheHe] makes of [From.GetHerselfHimself], as a member of our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_were_mildly_injured;In spite of some bruises and mild injury, I was not alone in being satisfied with the skill displayed by [From.GetBestName]. While I am intrigued, only time will tell whether joining our ranks is the right path for the [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman], or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10008_they_were_seriously_injured;[From.GetBestName] was rather seriously injured by [From.GetHerHis] opponent, [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName]. I expected my [combatant_2.GetRootRelation] to get in a blow or two, but I am mildly surprised that [From.GetTitledFirstName] still wants to join our ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10009_succeeded_greatly;To the valiant [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am told you did not receive a single scratch during your initiation! That is the kind of impressive [Root.GetWarriorRole] we would be honored to have sitting at our table. You are hereby humbly invited to join our ranks.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10009_was_mildly_injured;To the honorable [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nDuring your initiation, your display of bravery and good attitude impressed us all. We would gladly invite you into our ranks.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10009_was_seriously_injured;To the brave [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI understand you were seriously injured during your initiation, but that you remained standing. To reward this display of strength in the duel, I hereby officially invite you into our ranks.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10010;To the COWARD [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nNeedless to say, we are unimpressed by your behavior, and hope you do not seek us anytime soon, lest this offense escalates.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10012_A;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] smiles broadly at my encouragement. "I thought you would never ask! I'll contact [hero_character.GetTitledFirstName] right away, [Root.GetFatherMother].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10012_A_hero_is_parent;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] smiles broadly at my encouragement. "I thought you would never ask! So... how do we do this, [Root.GetFatherMother]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10012_B;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] rolls [new_recruit.GetHerHis] eyes at my attempted encouragement. "I will carve my own path, [Root.GetFatherMother]. Please, let me." When I do not respond, [new_recruit.GetSheHe] continues: "[hero_character.GetSocietyRank] [hero_character.GetTitledFirstName] is a bore, [Root.GetFatherMother].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10012_B_hero_is_parent;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] rolls [new_recruit.GetHerHis] eyes at my attempted encouragement. "I will carve my own path, [Root.GetFatherMother]. Please, let me." When I do not respond, [new_recruit.GetSheHe] continues: "War and combat is dreadfully boring, [Root.GetFatherMother].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10013_A;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, and not stopped talking about [new_recruit.GetHerHis] initiation duel. "It was exhilarating, [Root.GetFatherMother]! And now I am one of [new_recruit.Society.GetName]!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10014_A;My [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, but not said a single word for what feels like an eternity. When I try to coax some conversation out of the [new_recruit.GetBoyGirl], [new_recruit.GetSheHe] mumbles: "I am not like you, [Root.GetFatherMother]", face red with shame. "I failed my initiation rite.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10014_B;My [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, but not said a single word for what feels like an eternity. When I try to coax some conversation out of the [new_recruit.GetBoyGirl], [new_recruit.GetSheHe] mumbles: "Don't be mad. I changed my mind about joining [Root.Society.GetName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10016;My [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] is making some less than subtle remarks over dinner tonight, commenting on my swordsmanship and asking how interested I am in strategy of war. "Honestly, [Root.GetFirstName]... When are you going to become a member of [recruiting_parent.Society.GetName]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10017_A;My [From.GetFatherMother] tells me that it does not matter which path I walk. "Whether you choose the way of the sword, or the way of the quill, you are my [Root.GetSonDaughter]." We spent the rest of the evening talking about other hopes and dreams of mine, and I can only smile fondly when I think of [From.GetHerHis] support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10017_B;My [From.GetFatherMother] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] expected more from my duel, before eating the remainder of [From.GetHerHis] dinner in silence.\nI feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10020_duelist;Having learned what I can about one-on-one combat, swinging my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] being as easy as breathing, I have decided that it is time I focused on other pursuits common among [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10020_hunter;Having lost count of the [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] trophies which decorate the many walls of [Root.Capital.GetName], maybe I should spend some time on other pursuits befitting a member of [Root.Society.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10020_strategist;Having studied many a tome on the topic, as well as the practical application of it, I am already well-versed in strategic warfare... Perhaps it is time I focused on something else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10021;My fellow members of [Root.Society.GetName] have long been wondering when I will choose a focus for my fighting talents. There are those who live for the art of dueling, while others prefer the more theoretic side of combat... Yet hunting is also a worthwhile pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10022;I have studied my soldiers practicing their swordsmanship, and I am certain that some of them are becoming unsettled by the constant watch of their [Root.GetTitle]... Perhaps it is time I admit that I could use some guidance, when it comes to my own dueling? If nothing else, I could join their training...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10023;My [From.GetRootRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me, asking for private lessons in the arts of one-on-one combat. "The [From.GetTitle] is likely to appreciate any guidance we offer, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the messenger says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10024_A;When we started practicing together, I had a hard time imagining displaying the kind of expert confidence that [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] exudes on the battlefield. However, bolstered by [mentor_target.GetHerHis] training, I think I have truly found my calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10024_B;"Be careful where you point that thing!" a courtier cried out today, as I was sauntering back from yet another session at the training grounds, idly playing with the sword in my hand. The woman hurriedly corrected herself: "Of course, a master duelist such as yourself would know best, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10024_mentor_died;The last time we spoke, [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] had only praise to offer me. It's an odd feeling that [mentor_target.GetSheHe] is not here to see me now. Letting out a sigh, I clear my mind, focusing on the feeling of my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] in my hand. It's so natural to me now, as if part of my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10025;The stack of books in front of me is intimidating. My scholars tell me these are classics, for anyone interested in an introduction to strategic warfare. But I am [Root.GetTitledFirstName]! Surely, I do not need the basics? Should I not be out on the field, surveying the troops, first-hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10026;My commanders have come to request my advice on some exercises they are performing outside the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] walls. "We could really use that strategic mind of yours, [Root.GetMasterMistress]", they say. Startled, I realize that my studying has paid off, and my chest swells with pride. I then collect myself, nodding: "Of course, I'd be happy to help.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10030;The experienced hunters I have spending time with seem quite pleased with my weapons skills, and are wondering what I would like to explore next. Poring over the maps of the area outside of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName], my advisors suggest I learn more about the theory behind the tracking of various prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10031;We have been tracking a wild [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] for hours, when a growl sounds in the bushes next to us. A thunk, followed by a soft groan, tells me that my arrow has found its target. Relaxing my posture, I realize that the hunt is over. "They should be calling you [Root.GetTitledFirstName] the Hunter!" one of my companions laughs. I smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10040_A;"[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] would be proud of you", [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] tells me, [GetWarriorLodgeTrainingDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10040_B;"The dedication you display is admirable, [Root.GetSisterBrother]", [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] tells me, [GetWarriorLodgeTrainingDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10052;Reports state that new recruits have been partaking in our initiation ritual, allowing [Root.Society.GetName] to be growing in numbers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10055_INFECTION;All my [Root.GetBrotherSister]s of [Root.Society.GetName] know that infections are best treated with a calming poultice, good sleep, and fresh air. I am not surprised to find that the foul smell is gone from my wound, leaving but a pale scar behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10055_MAIMED;The old wound has finally healed, leaving a pretty grotesque scar behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10055_MANGLED;My injuries were extensive, but not enough to break me. Waking up this morning, I straighten my back. "This pain is temporary" I declare to my servant, who is watching me incredulously. The demons will have to try harder before [Root.GetTitledFirstName] surrenders to self-pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10055_SEVERELY_INJURED;I am starting to think the physician who looked at my injury was mistaken. The wound from the maiming has healed completely! Maybe it was all a trick of the light?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10055_WOUNDED;The old wound has finally healed, leaving a pretty grotesque scar behind. Some fresh air and walks in the [Root.Location.GetTerrain] surrounding [Root.Location.GetName] was all I needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10056_casualty;"Give me your axe! NOW!" I roar at the recruit. The young [Root.GetBoyGirl] obeys and the crowd around me gasps as I start swinging it around me, some scrambling to get out of my way. "[Root.GetFirstName], what are you doing?!" my [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] [kinslayer_target.GetFirstName] yells in despair, clutching at [kinslayer_target.GetHerHis] bloodied tunic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10056_no_harm_1;"Someone get me an axe!" I roar. The crowd gasps as I start swinging it around me, some scrambling in panic to get out of my way. One brave soul, [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName], steps in front of me, accepting the challenge. When we are done, we are laughing heartily. "I like your rage, [Root.GetBrotherSister]!" [kinslayer_target.GetSheHe] says, wiping the sweat from [kinslayer_target.GetHerHis] brow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10056_no_harm_2;"Someone get me an axe! NOW!" I roar to the closest soldier I can find. In the corner of my eye, I see my [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName] watching me. As I start swinging the weapon around, the rush of combat fills me. I find myself smiling, then laughing, from the bottom of my belly. [kinslayer_target.GetFirstName] is laughing too, and the crowd cheers me on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10057;[From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently went on a wild rampage through [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetCapitalHolding], and my poor [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName] was caught in the crossfire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10058;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn vengeance upon me, for the loss of [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName]. I... don't suppose [From.GetSheHe] would accept it if I sent a courier to explain that it was an accident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10059;Warriors from the area surrounding [target_holding.Capital.GetName] flock to my banner, and the [target_holding.GetCapitalHolding] garrison is bursting with new recruits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10060;"Our table is already full, [Root.GetSocietyRank]. Are you saying you want to fight me for the spot?" [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName] rises from [combatant_2.GetHerHis] seat, idly cracking [combatant_2.GetHerHis] knuckles and taking a step towards me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10062_A;Hail, [From.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nYou have proven yourself worthy of [Root.Society.GetName]. I admit defeat and hereby step back from the title you may now acquire – use it well. \n\nSigned, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10062_B;Hail, [From.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nWhile we mourn the loss, know that by defeating [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName] you have more than proven yourself worthy of the title you wished to acquire – use it well.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10063_A;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nIt was a valiant effort, but given the result of our duel, we cannot with good conscience let you advance to the next rank within [Root.Society.GetName]. I suggest you see more battle or spend some time in the training grounds.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10070_A;I can't take it any longer. "Jailer!" I shout. For some reason the person who shows up on the other sides of the bars is a [crossfire_target.GetManWoman], saying "I heard we had a real brute down here. I got curious." I lash out at [crossfire_target.GetHerHis] smirk, punching the iron bar so hard my fingers crunch. My blood boils, but all I can do is crumple to the floor, the pain overwhelming my blood thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10070_B;I can't stand being confined here. In the corner of our cell, [crossfire_target.GetFirstName] stands, scratching something in the wall. "Doesn't it drive you mad?!" I growl at [crossfire_target.GetHerHim]. "YOU drive me mad!" [crossfire_target.GetSheHe] roars, flying for my throat. My boiling blood takes hold of me and soon the [crossfire_target.GetManWoman] is lying whimpering on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10070_C;I have lost track of day and night, and everything reeks. The other prisoners laugh when I start attacking the wall. "Acting out your frustration?", they mock. After a few days, and some ridicule from the jailer, I manage to break loose an iron bar... The feeling of an actual weapon in my hand makes my blood boil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10071_A;The [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently went on a wild rampage through the [host_target.GetCapitalHolding] of [host_target.GetTitledFirstName], and my poor [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName] was caught in the crossfire! The [From.GetManWoman] even made it out of the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10071_B;The [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetTitledFirstName] went on a wild rampage through my dungeons and escaped the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]! As the [From.GetMadwomanMadman] beat through anyone who came in [From.GetHerHis] path, my poor [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] [kinslayer_target.GetTitledFirstName] was caught in the crossfire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_10004;I'll put on my most intimidating face. Ahem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10004_TT;You'll approach the [new_recruit.GetManWoman] to explain the initiation duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10005;I'll gladly fight to prove myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10005_bloodline;Legendary or not, I'm itching for a duel, my [hero_character.GetLordLady].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10005_TT;You agree to duel whoever it is that §Y[hero_character.Society.GetNameCap]§! has chosen for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10006_no;Why, that little-... The coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10006_TT_1;A sparring duel will take place between §Y[new_recruit.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[duel_target.GetTitledName]§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10006_yes;Show [new_recruit.GetHerHim] the ropes, [duel_target.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10008_accepting;Another member? Interesting, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10008_impressed;Now, that's what we want to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10008_surprised;Another member, eh? What do you know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10008_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! will be invited to join §Y[Root.Society.GetName]§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10008_unimpressed;What a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10009;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10010;I am as disappointed as you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10010_TT;You will be unable to join §Y[warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName]§! for years to come.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10012_1;I was just waiting for you to be ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10012_2;We'll play this fair. You're a recruit, like anybody else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10012_TT;§Y[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! will report back to you once [new_recruit.GetHerHis] trial is over.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10013;I knew you had it in you, [new_recruit.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10013_TT;§Y[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! has joined §Y[new_recruit.Society.GetName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10014;Oh, dear... I am still proud to call you family, [new_recruit.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10014_TT;§Y[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! will recover from [new_recruit.GetHerHis] failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10016;I have just been waiting for you to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10016_TT;§Y[hero_character.GetTitledFirstName]§! of [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] will be contacted.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10017_1;Family is what is most important, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10017_2;I am lucky to have [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10020;I should focus on personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10021;I should focus on personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10021_tt;This will lead to the §YDuelist§! trait.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10022;I shall get [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] to teach me everything [mentor_target.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10023;I'll of course personally set up [From.GetHerHis] training regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10024_A;I'll always be grateful for your lessons, [mentor_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10024_B;Oh, a master, am I? Why, yes, I suppose I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10024_C;It took time, but I suppose all that hard work has paid off...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10025;There is value in the historical records.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10026;Typically, what you'll want to consider in a set-up like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10026_tt;Soon, you are talking and gesturing excitedly, receiving "Oohs" and "Aaahs" in an even distribution.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10030;Oh, are these sketches of animal footprints? Tell me more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10031;I can't believe I wasn't always like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10040;Thank you, [fellow_member.GetFirstName]. That means a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10040_piety_loss_tt;In your heart, you feel that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] might frown upon your dedication to these people.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10055;I feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10056_1;Aaah, I shall be the scourge of our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10056_2;Aaah, by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]! You are a small sacrifice for my new-gained strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10057;I will not let this insult stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10058;I am sure we will settle this, in time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10060;A duel? Yes, that is what I am saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10062;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10063;I would be angry, if I wasn't so humiliated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10070_1;Aaargh! Just leave me alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10070_2;You want to go again?! I can do this all day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10070_3;Get out of my way! I am getting OUT of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_10005;Actually, I would rather not bloody my knuckles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10005_TT;You will not be attempting to join §Y[hero_character.Society.GetNameCap]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10008_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! will be §Rbanned§! from joining §Y[Root.Society.GetName]§!, for 10 years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10012;Why, you ungrateful little...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10012_TT;§Y[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is clearly not ready for this commitment.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10013;You almost make me wish I hadn't left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10013_TT;You suddenly feel a little nostalgic.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10014;I expected more, honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10014_TT;§Y[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! blinks away a tear.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10016;[recruiting_parent.GetFatherMotherCap], I will carve my own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10016_TT;Your [recruiting_parent.GetFatherMother] is disappointed.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10017_1;I am an embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10017_2;This is not the end of my story! Nay, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't KNOW me...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10017_TT;You'll show [From.GetHerHim]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10019_TT;You will be §Rbanned§! from joining §Y[Root.Society.GetName]§!, for 10 years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10020;I want to delve deeper into strategic thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10021;I want to delve deeper into strategic thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10021_tt;This will lead to the §YStrategist§! trait.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10022;I will discreetly hire someone to instruct me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10023;I will loan [From.GetHerHim] some of my best veterans to practice with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10025;I think I am more of a visual learner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10030;What about the actual capturing...? Let's talk more about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10055;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10056;W-who... Whose blood is this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10057;My [kinslayer_target.GetRootRelation] should have known to stay out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
