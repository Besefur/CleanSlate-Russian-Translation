EVTTITLE23911;The Offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF23802;It would not be appropriate to continue celebrations after the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The festival has been therefore canceled to allow the [From.GetTitle]'s close ones to properly mourn [From.GetHerHis] loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23804;With a war brewing on the horizon, we must set aside all frivolous activities and prepare for battle. I must therefore regretfully cancel the festival of [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23805;With a war brewing on the horizon, we must set aside all frivolous activities and prepare for battle. In light of this troubling new event, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had to regretfully cancel the festival of [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23806;A great festival is exactly what the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] need to strengthen the bonds with their fellow tribesmen. It will also be a great opportunity for the Chieftains to bring offerings to our ancestors, bringing prosperity to our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23808;I will be glad to join you for the §YGreat Festival§!, my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23812;The celebrations have finally begun. [Root.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to me and my ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23813;The celebrations have finally begun. [From.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23807;Greetings,\n[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nA great festival is being held at [From.Capital.GetName]. You are hereby invited to join us alongside your family to celebrate our fortune and bring our offerings to our great ancestors.\nSigned,\n\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23810;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nI have heard news of the great celebration you are preparing for your fellow tribesmen. I wager you'd enjoy the company of a fellow warrior to exchange stories with.\n\nSigned, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23811;The period of festivities is about to start. All sorts of peddlers, bards and fortunetellers are gathering in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], bringing their tales and offerings. I should make sure to prepare myself before traveling to meet my tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23814;A hoarse voice calls for my name from the crowd of peddlers, catching my attention. An old Seer is waiting for me sitting near an old runic stone. He claims that he will read my future for a small price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23815;The fortuneteller surprises me by predicting that extraordinary opportunities are about to present themselves to me in my near future, and I need only to pay close attention to find my good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23816;The fortuneteller assures me that a period of good luck is just around the corner, and that I need only look for the right opportunities in order to change my life for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23817;After giving a thorough look to the signs, the fortuneteller warns me that my future looks grim and I should be very careful about my next choices to avoid any calamity befalling upon me and my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23818;As I walk around the crowded streets of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], a strange aroma catches my attention, leading me to the obscure stand of an old alchemist. Seeing my curiosity, the man shows me some of his wares and their prodigious effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23819;As I walk around the crowded streets of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], a strange aroma catches my attention, leading me to the obscure stand of an old alchemist. Seeing my curiosity, the man shows me some of his wares and their prodigious effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23820;An old merchant has set up a large stand in the middle of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] this year, selling all sorts of amulets and trinkets to use at the end of the festival as offerings to the gods of our ancestors. I wonder if I should buy something to burn myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23821;I stumbled on [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetTitledFirstName] in the main hall with a group of other distinguished guests. I have heard quite a few good things about [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim] in the past, and I wonder if this festival is the right occasion to earn [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23822;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent the evening telling old tales of our clans to each other, having a very good time alongside the other guests of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast. I never noticed how likable [From.GetFirstName] was before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23823;For some reason, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] has entirely rejected my offer of friendship. I think [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] paranoid nature might have gotten the best of [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23824;[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] spent a great evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. When finally leaving, right before dawn, we swore an oath of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23825;[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] and I spent a very pleasant evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. We left the hall at dawn, both glad to have had this opportunity to strengthen our relation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23826;I was busy exchanging tales with some of the other tribesmen, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] approaches me with a smile, offering me a drink, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to make a toast to new friendships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23828;Seeing [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] having such a good time with the other tribesmen, laughing and drinking in the long-house, is an unbearable sight. I wish I could do something to bring [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] insufferable merriment to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23830;It looks like [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetFirstName] is smarter than [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHe] looks. [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHeCap] was able to see through my deception and reject my false offer of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23831;Just as I hoped, I was able to get [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] completely drunk and isolate [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim] from [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] friends. Now is the time to reveal my true intentions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23832;[From.GetTitledFirstName] fooled me! After getting me drunk, [From.GetSheHe] abandoned me in the wilderness, in the dead of night. I am too tired and confused to find my way back to the tribe, and I think I hear something growling nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23833;I do not understand. One moment [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I are having fun, drinking and exchanging tales, and the moment after [From.GetSheHe] is insulting me, shaming me for being nothing but a drunken fool in front of everybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23834;We were all happily celebrating our good fortune in [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s long-house, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to ruin the mood of the feast by yelling my name and showering me with insults, clearly trying to upset me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23835;I have received several complaints from my guests in the last days regarding [warrior_lodge_guest.GetTitledFirstName]. Apparently, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetSheHe] has been going around town, picking fights, bragging about [warrior_lodge_guest.GetHerHis] great feats and shaming my own tribesmen for lacking in strength and courage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23836;The priests are preparing a large feast to offer to our ancestors tonight. I have been spying at the servants bringing in the offerings in the great hall for some time. Some of my friends have dared me to see if I can sneak in and out under the priests' noses without being spotted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23837;I am only a few step into the main hall when I hear somebody call for me. One of the priests has spotted me! With my face growing red, I manage to run away just in time to avoid being caught. My playmates welcome me with a shower of chuckles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23838;With just a bit of care, I manage to sneak past the servants and get into the main hall. The weird statues of the ancestors are all assembled near the long table, decorated with trinkets and surrounded by food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23839;I was surprised to hear that the statues in the temple of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] have moved to a nefarious position. The priests wander around town informing everyone of the prodigious event for several hour before news comes out that the misplacement was just the result of [From.GetFirstName] sneaking into the temple and rearranging them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23840;[From.GetFirstName] and some of [From.GetHerHis] playmates have stolen the offerings for tonight's feast of the ancestors. The priests were furious to find the little piglets sleeping in the woods near [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], surrounded by the remains of their loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23841;A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival, and one of my playmates has challenged me to steal one of his trinkets while he is distracted haggling, to make up for all the times that he mistreated us children in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23842;Just as I stretch my arm to pick the item from the stand, the merchant grabs me by the wrist and pushes me aside, warning me to keep away from his wares. Trying again now that he has been put on alert would just be a waste of time, so I am forced to return to my playmates empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23843;It takes just a few moments of distraction for me to snatch one of the merchant's amulets and run away in the crowd before he can even realize that he has been robbed. I return triumphant to my playmates, and we spend the rest of the afternoon looking from a safe distance the old merchant scrambling through his wares, trying to find the missing trinket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23844;Today's festivities were disrupted by the complaints of a foreign merchant. The old man spent most of the afternoon claiming that one of the town's kids had stolen a precious amulet from his stand and would not leave until he received compensation for his losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23845;The festival has attracted many people from all over the realm to [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Unfortunately, many of the new grownups are stuck-up bores with no good manners. I have half a mind to gather a few of my playmates and teach them a lesson...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23846;We have barely started having fun when a some of the tribes' warriors decide to take matters in their own hands and take on us. All my friends immediately desert me, leaving me alone to face the angry tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23847;With just the help of a few other kids and a well-placed tree, we are able to successfully throw the entire party into disarray. People scream and run for cover, yelling our names and throwing back swears at us. When the adults finally organize to get us, we have already dispersed to laugh off the successful mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23848;I was just chatting with some of the other tribesmen in the main square of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], when something hit me on the back! Shouts and complaints swiftly follow, turning the entire square into a complete chaos. A few of the kids have climbed on a nearby tree and they have started throwing mud at the rest of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23849;All the grownups are busy, and I am bored. As I try to think of something to do, I spot [scoped_running_child_1.GetFirstName] and suddenly remember about that time [scoped_running_child_1.GetSheHe] bragged about being the fastest kid of the whole tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23850;[From.GetFirstName] challenged me to a race around town to determine who is the fastest kid of the tribe. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems very confident that [From.GetSheHe] will win and has already started to tease me that I am too much of a coward to even accept [From.GetHerHis] challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23851;Turns out that [From.GetFirstName] was too much of a coward to pick up my challenge. [From.GetSheHeCap] has run away with [From.GetHerHis] tail between [From.GetHerHis] legs, throwing some poor excuse to avoid the race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23852;After we gather a few playmates to act as witnesses, [From.GetFirstName] and I are off running around town, dodging servants, scaring off farm animals, zigzagging through the fields for the quickest path. Several minutes later, I jump head-first over the final line, surrounded by the cheers of the other kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23854;There is an old tree at the edge of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Kids say it is more than one hundred years old, and that sometimes the ancestors use it as a ladder to get into our world, and nobody aside from the shamans ever gets close to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23855;It was not easy. Every few steps I had to stop and hold my breath, listening to the ominous creaking coming from the gray branches of the old tree. And yet, with just a bit of patience and stubbornness, I was able to get all the way to the top. There are no gods around as far as I can see, but I have a full view of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23856;I was almost halfway through the climbing, when an ominous creaking announced the breaking of one of the branches I was balancing a foot on. Grabbing at the air and letting out a choked squeal, I fall from the old tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23860;After a few unintended fights and several challenges thrown amongst guests, it has been decided that the best way to appease the crowd is to organize a tournament of our best warriors. Not only there are many in the tribe excited to test their mettle in a friendly competition, the shamans have also assured me that this will be a good way to obtain the favor of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA23862;After a recent scuffle between some of our fighters during a feast, many of my guests are pushing for a great drinking contest to determine who amongst us is the most resilient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23863;Many of the guests in [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s long-house have taken the habits of organizing drinking games during the great feasts we are holding almost every night to celebrate the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23864;With so many lavish feasts being prepared for the festival, many of my guests have started to talk about out-competing each other to see who amongst them can eat fastest and the most, to the point that every other night we have an eating contest or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23865;With so many lavish feasts being prepared for the festival, many of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s guests have started to talk about out-competing each other to see who amongst them can eat fastest and the most, to the point that every other night we have an eating contest or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23866;The trading brought by the great festival has refilled our stables with a large number of fine steeds. Some of them less tame than others. A few of my fighters were thinking about competing to tame the wildest horses in our stocks, which I think will be the perfect way to entertain my guests as well as to discipline the most turbulent stallions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23867;The trading brought by the great festival has refilled [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s stables with a large number of fine steeds. Some of them less tame than others. To entertain [great_tribal_festival_host.GetHerHis] guests as well as to discipline the most turbulent of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetHerHis] stallions, our host has decided to issue a horse-taming competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23868;Some of my advisors and shamans suggested me that it would be a good idea to entertain my guests by issuing a friendly competition during this period of festivity, aimed at finding who is the fairest in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23869;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] advisors have come up with the idea of organizing a beauty contest during this year's celebration, allowing entries from all of the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23870;With so many travelers and bards coming to [Root.Capital.GetName] to exchange stories and enjoy the period of festivities, I have come to the conclusion that we should simply organize a poetry contest, to see which of our guests has the sharpest tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23871;With so many travelers and bards coming to [From.Capital.GetName] to exchange stories and enjoy the period of festivities, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to organize a great poetry contest, to see which of [From.GetHerHis] guests has the sharpest tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23872;With so many travelers and bards coming to [Root.Capital.GetName] to exchange stories and enjoy the period of festivities, I have come to the conclusion that we should simply organize a singing contest, to see which of our guests has the sweetest voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23873;With so many travelers and bards coming to [From.Capital.GetName] to exchange stories and enjoy the period of festivities, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to organize a great singing contest, to see which of [From.GetHerHis] guests has the sweetest voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23874;Many gifted artisans have been drawn to [Root.Capital.GetName] to offer their skills to create some of the offerings for the ancestors. To make the best use of their abilities, I have decided to organize a weaving contest, allowing our best craftsmen to compete against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To make the best use of their abilities, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to organize a weaving contest, allowing [From.GetHerHis] best craftsmen to compete against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23876_A;The crowd quickly assembles in the town square as the first contenders find their place in the fighting ring. I am one of the first to be picked, and soon find myself in the thick of a brawl, dodging and striking against my first opponent while our tribesmen cheer around us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23876_B;The crowd quickly assembles in the town square as the first contenders find their place in the fighting ring. The first brawl starts with encouraging cheers from everyone. Soon, a series of bruised warriors finds its place in the losers' corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23880;I hold down the last opponent for a few moments still, making sure to ensure my victory before standing up to the cheers of all the tribesmen. As the last [Root.GetManWoman] standing, I am the undisputed winner of the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23881;With a final strike, [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] pushes me on the ground, painfully holding me down until I am forced to admit defeat. I have managed to win several fights during the course of the tournament, only to have the final victory stolen from me by this [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23882;The fights go on for the entire day. When the sun sets, only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] remains standing: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The crowd acclaims [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] as the uncontested winner of the tournament, showering [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] with cheers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23883;I need one of the servants to help me stand after the final drink. My vision is blurry and I can barely form a coherent thought, but, hearing my name being cheered on by the other guests makes me fairly confident that I have managed to win the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23884;I hold off as much as I can, but, in the end, I find myself on the ground, covered in mead and spit. I feel as if somebody is striking my skull with a hammer and barely manage to understand anything that is happening around me, but I clearly hear the name of [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] being repeated over and over by the other tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23885;One by one, the contenders tap out, either falling asleep on the ground or stumbling away from the long-house with disgruntled mumblings. There is only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] who is left standing at the end: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The tribesmen raise [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] up and parade [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] across the hall, chanting [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23886;I throw away the last bone and let out a long sigh, looking at the pile of plates beside me. There is a moment of silence as my only remaining opponents falls down, followed by the cheering of the crowd. Some of the tribesmen try to raise me up, but, after a few failed attempts, they decide to just pat me on the back instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23887;I manage to keep eating long after most other contenders have tapped out, but, unfortunately, as much as I try to, I am unable to keep up with [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] and, in the end, I have to concede [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] victory, and slide back on the hall's bench, sore and reeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23888;One by one, the contenders tap out, either rushing outside, or falling on the ground reeling. There is only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] who is left standing at the end: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The tribesmen raise [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] up and parade [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] across the hall, chanting [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23889;The stallion falters and stops resisting, and I lead him on a slow trot near the line of tribesmen witnessing me in silence. When I dismount, I am welcomed by some cheering, but only after about an hour of discussion the group decides that I had proven myself to be the fastest and most resolute amongst the tamers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23890;Despite avoiding any embarrassing fall, by the end of the day most of the tribesmen who witnessed the contest come to the conclusion that I was not firm and fast enough to deserve to win the tournament. The honor is instead bestowed to [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23891;During the course of the day, the crowd is presented with several embarrassing falls from the various contenders. Only after getting rid of the least skilled tamers the real competition can begin. By the end of the day, after a bit of squabbling, most of the tribesmen come to the conclusion that [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] has proven to be the most competent horse-tamer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23892;My looks and pose are absolutely impeccable throughout the day. It comes as no surprise when the judges selected for the contest proclaim me to be the fairest [Root.GetManWoman] in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. I walk past the other contenders, ignoring their deathly glares and politely thank the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23893;I was so close to winning. I really thought the judges had taken a liking on me. Unfortunately, at the end of the day it is [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] the one to be celebrated as fairest [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23894;The contenders parade one by one through the main hall, for all to see and comment upon, and, little by little, the tribesmen chosen to pass judgment on them start picking the best. As the sun starts to wane on the horizon, only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] is left: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], who is cheered as fairest of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23895;My poem captivates everyone in the long-house. It is thrilling and passionate, featuring epic battles and tragic romances, and leaving everyone holding their breath. Once I conclude my performance, there is little doubt that the prize for best bard of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] will go to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23896;My poem leaves quite a few mouths hanging, and seems to receive a very good reaction from the guests. Unfortunately, when [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] starts telling [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] story, it becomes clear to me that I will not be the winner of this contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23897;The contest gives us the opportunity to hear many new amazing stories. Tales of love and war to captivate all the people of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. In the end, though, the uncontested winner turns out to be [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], whose epic storytelling skills manage to enthrall the entire town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23898;My voice immediately captivates everyone in the long-house. Not one whisper interrupts my performance, the entire room listens in complete silence. Once I stop singing, I am showered with praise, and immediately proclaimed the winner of the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23899;My song leaves quite a few mouths hanging, and seems to receive a very good reaction from the guests. Unfortunately, when [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] starts singing [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis], it becomes clear to me that I will not be the winner of this contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23900;The contest provides everyone with a very pleasant evening centered around music. Exciting, upbeat pieces alternate with heart-wrenching poems, but nobody amongst the many contenders manages to move the crowd as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], whose voice rightfully earns [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] the title of best singer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23901;It was an exhausting task. At the end of the day I can barely see straight and I have only little feeling left in my fingers, but the result was far worth all the pain it caused me. My tapestry was acclaimed as the undisputed best piece of artwork anyone in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23902;I work as fast as I could, but, by the end of the day, I am forced to leave my tapestry unfinished. Despite several of my tribesmen praising my work, its imperfection doomed it to lose the competition to [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]'s masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23903;Of the many tapestries created today none is as marvelous as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]'s. [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHisCap] work is acclaimed by most guests as the most original and skillfully made, ensuring [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] victory in the competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23904;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to give me a large sum of money for my performance during the festival, praising me in front of all the tribesmen gathered in [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23910;With the period of festivities nearing its end, it is finally time to burn our offerings to the ancestors and pray that they will protect us in the years to come. A long moment of silence shrouds [Root.Capital.GetName] as the smoke rises to the nightly sky, then the shamans lead us in a somber hymn, concluding the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA23911;With the period of festivities nearing its end, it is finally time to burn our offerings to the ancestors and pray that they will protect us in the years to come. A long moment of silence shrouds [From.Capital.GetName] as the smoke rises to the nightly sky, then the shamans lead us in a somber hymn, concluding the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23811;The period of festivities is about to start. All sorts of peddlers, bards and fortunetellers are gathering in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], bringing their tales and offerings. This is surely going to be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn new games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23814;An old woman suddenly jumps in my line of sight, giving me a toothless smile and shaking a cup filled with dice. She claims that she can determine what the stars have in store for me, for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23839;[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak into the temple and rearrange the positions of the ancestors' statues! Even better, the old priests thought that the statues had moved by themselves and went screaming around town that a terrible calamity was about to strike all of us before they learned the truth and became the laughing stock of town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23840;[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak inside the temple and steal some of the offerings for the ancestors. [From.GetSheHeCap] them brought them outside of town and shared them with the rest of us. We spent the rest of the evening laughing at the grown-ups wandering around the tribe, trying to understand what happened to the missing food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23844;A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival. Whenever he comes to town, he is always mean to me and my playmates, so, this year, we decided to get even with him. [From.GetFirstName] snuck behind his stand while he was distracted and stole one of his most precious trinkets, leaving the old merchant to spend the rest of the day looking for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23848;Some of the town's kids, led by [From.GetTitledFirstName], have decided to pester their parents and neighbors by throwing mud at them in the middle of the morning fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23852;After we gather a few playmates to act as witnesses, [From.GetFirstName] and I are off running around town, dodging servants, scaring off farm animals, zigzagging through the fields for the quickest path. Unfortunately, just a few steps before the finishing line, I trip over a rock and fall to the ground, allowing [From.GetFirstName] to surpass me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23876_A;A long line of tribesmen sit one next to each other, slamming their tankards on the table and loudly inciting the few contenders to keep drinking, one cup after the other. I clear my throat and blink a few times, waiting for someone to refill my horn, glancing at the closest of my opponents, eager for my next turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23876_B;A long line of tribesmen sit one next to each other, slamming their tankards on the table and loudly inciting the few contenders to keep drinking, one cup after the other. Little by little, some of the contenders tap off, their heads falling heavily on the table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23882;I try my best, but, after only a few encounters I am forced to surrender and join the other less fortunate contenders, waiting for the tournament to end. When the sun sets, only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] remains standing: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The crowd acclaims [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] as the uncontested winner of the tournament, showering [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] with cheers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23885;One by one, the contenders tap out, either falling asleep on the ground or stumbling away from the long-house with disgruntled mumblings. After some time, I am reluctantly forced to join them as well. In the end, there is only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] who is left standing: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The tribesmen raise [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] up and parade [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] across the hall, chanting [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23888;One by one, the contenders tap out, either rushing outside, or falling on the ground reeling. After some time, I am reluctantly forced to join them as well. In the end, there is only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] who is left standing: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]. The tribesmen raise [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] up and parade [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] across the hall, chanting [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23891;Unfortunately, I have barely started to take control over my steed when I am thrown off the saddle and land on my back. With my poor display of skill, I am amongst the first contenders to be eliminated. By the end of the day, after a bit of squabbling, most of the tribesmen come to the conclusion that [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName] has proven to be the most competent horse-tamer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23894;One by one, we parade through the main hall for all our tribesmen to see and comment upon, and, little by little, the judges start picking the best of us. Unfortunately, I am not one of the lucky ones. As the sun starts to wane on the horizon, only one [tribal_festival_winner.GetManWoman] is left: [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], who is cheered as fairest of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23897;The contest gives us the opportunity to hear many new amazing stories. Tales of love and war to captivate all the people of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Unfortunately, the public does not seem to receive well my own poetry, and the uncontested winner turns out to be [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], whose epic storytelling skills manage to enthrall the entire town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23900;The contest provides everyone with a very pleasant evening centered around music. Exciting, upbeat pieces alternate with heart-wrenching poems, but no one amongst us manages to move the crowd as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName], whose voice rightfully earns [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHim] the title of best singer of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23903;Unfortunately for me, of the many tapestries created today none is as marvelous as [tribal_festival_winner.GetFirstName]'s. [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHisCap] work is acclaimed by most guests as the most original and skillfully made, ensuring [tribal_festival_winner.GetHerHis] victory in the competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB23910;With the period of festivities coming to an end, the priests lead a procession of faithful carrying our village's most sacred icon, on a litter filled with all the offerings accumulated into the past days. A long moment of silence shrouds [Root.Capital.GetName] as the holy symbol blesses the streets of the village with its presence before being brought back to the safety of the local chapel, concluding the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFC23814;As I am appraising some of the merchandise of the travelers drawn to the festival, I meet the unsettling gaze of a weird boy in tatters. The kid approaches me slowly, ignoring the crowd bustling with activity around him, and whispers that he can read me my future for just a small price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC23848;[From.GetFirstName] decided to take me and some of the other kids and get back at some of the stuck-up adults in our town by laying a trap on them during the morning fair, to cover them in mud and slush. And it was an absolute triumph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC23876_A;A long line of tribesmen sit one next to each other, slamming their fists on the table and loudly inciting the few contenders to eat faster, as the servants move back and forward to bring more food and take away empty plates. I phase out for a moment, gagging, and then go back to my meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFC23910;With the period of festivities nearing its end, it is finally time to burn our offerings to the old gods and pray that they will protect us in the years to come. A long moment of silence shrouds [Root.Capital.GetName] as the smoke rises to the nightly sky, then the shamans lead us in a somber hymn, concluding the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF23822;But what does [From.GetSheHe] *really* wants from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
