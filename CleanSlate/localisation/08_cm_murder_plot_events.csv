EVTDESC_CM_6000;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have received news that [From.GetTitledName] has chosen to go into hiding in order to try to foil a plot against [From.GetHerHis] life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6001;My [Root.GetLordLady], it seems that [From.GetTitledName] has finally decided to come out of hiding, no longer as fearful for [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6002;My [Root.GetLordLady], news has reached us that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has sent [FromFrom.GetHerHis] [From.GetHusbandWife] [From.GetFirstName] into hiding in order to protect [From.GetHerHim] from a suspected murder plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6003;My [Root.GetLordLady], it seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has brought [FromFrom.GetHerHis] [From.GetHusbandWife] [From.GetFirstName] out of hiding, no longer as fearful of murder plots against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6004;My [Root.GetLordLady], news has reached us that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has sent [FromFrom.GetHerHis] [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] into hiding in order to protect [From.GetHerHim] from a suspected murder plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6005;My [Root.GetLordLady], it seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has brought [FromFrom.GetHerHis] [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] out of hiding, no longer as fearful of murder plots against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6100;This terrible isolation in hiding... it has long been fraying at your fragile soul... it's almost unbearable. Yet you must learn to live with it... you must... adapt your mind. Yes, adapt... become something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6101;It seems that your [GetFromRelation]'s spirit has been suffering greatly from hiding away for so long, enough to drive [From.GetHerHim] insane...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6102;You sit in hiding, thinking of your enemies, how they could get to you and how you might prevent it. You go over all your plans again and again - did you really take the proper precautions? Are there any persons close to you that might plot against you? Can you really trust the guards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6104;Hiding from your enemies, you gain little opportunity for spending time with others. Also, there is little opportunity for 'spending time' with others. You find, however, that you are getting used to it. Indeed, the absence of carnal thoughts makes you feel strangely pure and more at ease with yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6105;[From.GetFirstName] has been hiding from [From.GetHerHis] enemies for some time now, living in relative isolation. The experience seems to have changed [From.GetHerHim]. You find that [From.GetSheHe] no longer shows a physical interest in you the same way that [From.GetSheHe] used to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6106;Living your life in hiding, you have much time to reflect on your situation. Sometimes there is fear, sometimes there is doubt. As the long hours pass at night, you find yourself increasingly taking comfort in religious musings. With time, the hope that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will protect you strengthens and becomes certainty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6108;It is hard to stay in hiding for so many hours of the day, being physically inactive and unable to walk in the light of the sun whenever you wish. Though you are more secure like this, you wish you were not forced to sit here like some rat. Yes... you do feel like a wretched rat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6110;You have been spending too much time hiding in dusty, cold cellars and not getting enough fresh air. It is said that the stale air of closed rooms is unhealthy if too much time is spent there. Indeed, you aren't feeling all that well right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6112;It's very boring to sit in hiding. The hours are long, and not many pleasures are available. Luckily, there's always the joy of a good strong meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6114;Hiding from your enemies, you spend a lot of time just sitting around. As time passes, you feel yourself getting used to it. You find you don't have the energy for doing much work, but there's also no urgency, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6116;Life in hiding is not like normal life. You see very few people, everyone else is busy and it seems they have no time to come and see you. As time passes, you find that you start to get annoyed at the few visitors you do get. You just don't know what to say to people anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6118;Life in hiding suits you, you feel much safer now than you have felt in years. It's always better to be safe than to be sorry. Or dead, surely. You're glad that you're getting this opportunity to reflect upon all the mistakes you've made in your life. You've been taking too many risks, but you will not be so foolish again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6120;When people are out to kill you, and you sacrifice daily pleasures and companionship in order to hide from them, you do come to appreciate the little things in life and how much joy they can really bring you. Reflecting on this is making you see a new perspective, and suddenly the bigger issues seem less... big.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6122;Life in hiding is very limiting. You miss things like being outside, seeing people, enjoying good food and drink, games, merriment and companionship. When this trying time is over, you vow to compensate by living life to the fullest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6124;Spending your time hidden away from your enemies, you don't get much outdoors time, nor do you see many people. You have taken to making the time pass by reading. You did not expect, however, that such a wonderful new world would open up to you through these books...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6126;Trying to occupy your mind while hiding from enemy plotters, you have been reading some interesting new books that a friend acquired for you from a foreign bookmerchant. You study the books late into the night, fascinated with the strange mysteries that they describe. You start to think that maybe you could expand on these ideas yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6128;Spending time in hiding, you find it hard to sleep at night. Your mind wanders, you feel restless. Someone once said that the restless soul needs to express itself, or it shall wilt and die. Perhaps you should pick up quill and parchment and write something?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6130;Your daily religious observations will keep you safe. You say the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] ten times on the strike of each hour - first forwards, then backwards. Each time you do it, you feel closer to the unearthly and the divine. You can feel it stronger and stronger. Something is coming, something is changing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6132;It's frustrating and boring to hide away from the world like this. You need a little something to put a warm glow on your days. Perhaps a drink would help... ah, that's good, this is working. Perhaps another one, just one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6180;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have received news that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has gone into hiding! This will severely compromise our efforts to assassinate [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_6200;The world is a dangerous place, and devious plots are everywhere. Rumors have reached you that people are conspiring to kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_CM_6303;Late one evening, as you are sitting in your hiding place, contemplating your situation, there is a sound just outside. You look up, and to your astonishment see one of the guards falling through the door, stabbed in the neck. A man clad in black enters and walks silently but swiftly towards you. As you rise to challenge him, he makes a swift movement and you feel a sharp pain in your chest. You look down and see a dagger lodged between your ribs. Your legs start to buckle underneath you, and your vision starts to blur...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You look up, and to your astonishment see one of the guards falling through the door, stabbed in the neck. A man clad in black enters and walks silently but swiftly towards you. As you rise to challenge him, he suddenly stops with a surprised face. He slowly falls into your arms, blood pouring from his mouth. Behind him you see one of your guards, wounded but with sword in hand. You thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for your narrow escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_CM_6313;You are sitting dining by yourself in your hiding place. The cheese is excellent, the grapes are delightful. You take a sip of your drink, closing your eyes and savoring the sensation, imagining that you are at a great banquet. Time to try the soup.. aah it's good, very good. But that hint of a bitter taste, what is it? Oh... suddenly a pain grips your limbs. This is not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
