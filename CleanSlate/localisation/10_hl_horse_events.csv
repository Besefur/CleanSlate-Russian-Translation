EVTDESC_HL_6000;You go out into the herd to choose a strong and powerful warhorse. You look around with expert eyes and eventually spot a steed that stands out from the rest. It is strong and has a powerful bearing.\n\nAs you mount your new steed, you feel certain that you have made the right choice. All that remains now is to give it a suitable name - what shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_6010;Your ward, [ward_cant_ride.GetFirstName], is almost eight years old now and still cannot ride a horse properly. It is truly a disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_6020;Traveling from one of your camps to the next, you come upon a river. Rains have made it swell and the rapids are strong and violent. The way around is too long, however, so you must cross. You watch with concern as the party gingerly begins to descend into the churning waters. [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName], your [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetHusbandWife], crosses riding your favorite horse.\n\nYou are watching from the bank as it suddenly happens... [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] loses control in the strong rapids and falls off the horse as it loses its footing, and both of them are grabbed by the strong current. You realize that you only have a moment to react before they are swept away, you cannot save them both...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_6021;You managed to pull [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] out of the river. You lost your favorite horse, but your [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetHusbandWife] is safe. [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHeCap] is terrified but overjoyed at the narrow escape and your brave rescue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_6022;You managed to pull [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] out of the river. Once safe, [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHe] stands up, dripping wet and shivering, and curses you: 'You imbecile! I would have been fine! How could you let that fine horse drown?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_6030;One of your loyal retinue warriors has approached you with a petition for aid. He says his family lost several of their mares to illness and now they are struggling to feed their children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HL_6000;Dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_6010;This will not do! I shall teach [ward_cant_ride.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_6020;I must save [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_6021;I am glad [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHe]'s safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_6022;I, too, now question my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_6030;You shall have six mares from my personal herd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HL_6000;Sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HL_6010;What a useless child. Let [ward_cant_ride.GetHerHim] flounder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HL_6020;I must save Dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Dragon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HL_6030;Unfortunate, but I cannot help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HL_6000;Arrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HL_6020;I must save Sky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Sky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HL_6000;Lightning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HL_6020;I must save Arrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Arrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_HL_6020;I must save Lightning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Lightning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
