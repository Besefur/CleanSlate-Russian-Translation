EVTOPTFUS_FROM_TRUTH_BOMB_TT;ยงY[From.GetFirstName]ยง! might be pleased with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZE_12210;Languishing in the dungeon, you have recently made a new friend. It's a small, scruffy rat that keeps coming up to you and cuddling up in your lap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12220;Languishing in my dungeon, one night I suddenly wake up with a cold feeling of apprehension. As I stare into the darkness, a hissing, evil voice speaks to me: 'I am the Dread King of Darkness. This dungeon is my realm, and I demand that you serve me.'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12221;Late one night, the Dread King of Darkness appears to me again: 'Servant! You must find me the three dark stones of sorcery. They have been stolen from me and hidden in this dungeon. Know that I do not abide failure!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12222;Eventually, I managed to recover the three dark stones of sorcery for the Dread King of Darkness. They only look like three ordinary little stones, but surely the King will be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12223;I never managed to recover the three dark stones of sorcery. I now fear that the Dread King of Darkness will come and punish me for my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12225;My war with the Dread King of Darkness has begun. Every night he sends his legions of ghosts and shadows to assault me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12226;In my valiant nightly battles against the Dread King of Darkness, I have finally reached the tipping point and forced my enemy to his knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12227;I am exhausted from my nightly battles with the Dread King of Darkness, yet he is steadily advancing against me. It seems that the time for surrender has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12230;Languishing in the dungeon, I have realized that there is someone in the cell next to me. I can hear [event_ze_12230_prisoner.GetHerHim] sighing, coughing and complaining sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12234;It turns out that my fellow prisoner's name is [From.GetTitledName]. We have had many whispered conversations in the darkness, quickly becoming friends under these dismal circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_12236;My attemps to make contact with the other prisoner were met only with silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_12000;I've come across [haughty_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick] kissing one of the servant folk in a hallway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12002;As I'm spending a pleasant moment alone with the attractive cook, the wretched child [From.GetFirstName] comes upon us and promptly starts chiding me about morals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't take kindly to my chiding. [From.GetSheHeCap] caught me and gave me a good beating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12006;[From.GetFirstName], the [GetRootFromInsult], went around and told everyone lies about me, as childish revenge for the deserved beating I gave [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12010;I have seen [affectionate_events_char_1.GetFirstName] looking at my new wooden toy animals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12012;[From.GetFirstName] has much nicer toys than me, and [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I want to play with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12014;[From.GetFirstName] and me played all day with my toys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12016;[From.GetFirstName] let me play with [From.GetHerHis] toys all day and it was so much fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12020;I saw [timid_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstName] being chided publicly for stealing food from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle], but I know [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] was elsewhere at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12022;I was wrongfully accused of stealing fine foods from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]. I also know that young [From.GetFirstName] can confirm I was elsewhere when it happened, but [From.GetSheHe] has refused to step forward and confirm my innocence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12024;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is very angry with me for not speaking up in [From.GetHerHis] defence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12026;Since [From.GetFirstName] refused to defend me, many people think I'm a thief and I have lost prestige at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12030;[rowdy_events_char_1.GetFirstName] is always so annoying. I think [rowdy_events_char_1.GetSheHe] tries to win against me in games just to spite me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12032;[From.GetFirstName] is angry with me because I am always winning against [From.GetHerHim] in games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12034;[From.GetFirstName] got angry and told me to get lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12036;[From.GetFirstName] went crazy and started a fist fight with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12040;[willful_events_char_1.GetFirstName] is frowning at me. 'Waste of time. It will never fit, you've grown out of it.' [willful_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says. But it's my favorite hat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12042;[From.GetFirstName] insists that I help [From.GetHerHim] get an old hat to fit. A very futile task as [From.GetSheHe]'s too big for it now as I've already told [From.GetHerHim] several times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12044;[From.GetFirstName] hit me over the head for not listening to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I'm mean for not helping. [From.GetSheHeCap] even stuck [From.GetHerHis] tongue out at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12050;[brooding_events_char_1.GetTitledName] promised to take me riding today, but when I came to see [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim] [brooding_events_char_1.GetSheHe] was drunk and half asleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12052;Sure, I forgot about my promise to take [From.GetFirstName] riding. But now... Now [From.GetSheHe] poured water on me when I was resting. I only had a little bit to drink, and and and I am the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] tried to say something, but I couldn't hear what it was. Then [From.GetSheHeCap] got up and raised [From.GetHerHis] fist at me before stumbling and falling. Now [From.GetSheHe] is snoring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12056;I have a bad headache, and my episode with [From.GetFirstName] is slowly coming back to me. There is no excuse for my behavior. What's worse is that I even got lectured by a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12060;[indolent_events_char_1.GetFirstName] has come to get my help, today we are going to cut down some trees. Very hard work [indolent_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12062;As soon as I came to pick up [From.GetFirstName] to help me out cutting down some trees [From.GetSheHe] starts complaining. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has a nasty stomach ache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] spanked me when I complained about my stomach ache. Then [From.GetSheHe] grabbed my arm and told me we were going outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12066;[From.GetFirstName] apparently has pains in [From.GetHerHis] arm now after I grabbed it and 'cannot use it to cut trees'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12070;It has been a long day outside and [playful_events_char_1.GetTitledName] says it is time to head back home. [playful_events_char_1.GetSheHeCap] is carrying some heavy bags, maybe this time I can beat [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12072;After I told [From.GetFirstName] it was time to head on home, [From.GetSheHe] looked at me with a grin on [From.GetHerHis] face and told me to race [From.GetHerHim] home, leaving me to carry everything on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] chased and caught me. Maybe next time I can run fast enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12076;[From.GetFirstName] never seems to be grumpy, always playing without a care in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12080;I saw that the private chambers of [conscientious_events_char_1.GetFullName] were very messy. Papers, books and things lying around everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12082;As I enter my chambers, all of the work I had done in my spare time seems to have been cleaned up and put back. Books are neatly set in alphabetical order and notes have been thrown away. [From.GetFullName] was apparently 'cleaning' earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12084;[From.GetTitledName] didn't like that I was cleaning [From.GetHerHis] chambers, [From.GetSheHe] could not find important books. Now [From.GetSheHe] messed mine up and said I wasn't allowed back in [From.GetHersHis] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12086;[From.GetFirstName] is quietly cleaning [From.GetHerHis] chambers after my episode in there. Seems like this is a very thorough child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12090;It's bedtime but I can't find my favorite toy. I have it when I go to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy is missing and [From.GetSheHe] won't go to bed without it. I may have thrown it out today when I was tidying up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] offered to get me a new toy. [From.GetSheHeCap] said we could go find something nice tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12096;My offer to purchase a new toy was rejected by [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is upset I would even suggest such a thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12100;Today [curious_events_char_1.GetFullName] said [curious_events_char_1.GetSheHe] had to attend to various important matters, and I would have to spend the day alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12102;I had told [From.GetFirstName] to stay at home, but just as I finish purchasing my gift to [From.GetHerHim] I turn around and see [From.GetHerHim] trying to hide from me. The surprise is ruined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12104;[From.GetTitledName] was buying things at the market and [From.GetSheHe] saw me there. Then [From.GetSheHe] pinched my ear and said I should do what I am told. [From.GetSheHeCap] was getting me a treats at the market but now I won't get any!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] didn't react well to my way of correcting [From.GetHerHis] behavior. I fear [From.GetSheHe] is even more suspicious towards me now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12110;[idolizer_events_char_1.GetTitledName] is so kind to me. And [idolizer_events_char_1.GetSheHe] seems to know so much about everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] has written a song in my honor. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] wants me to know that I'm the best person in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] was very happy for my gesture. [From.GetSheHeCap] agreed that [From.GetHerHis] exceptional personality and skill is worthy of songs and praise. Now the others could see [From.GetHerHim] for what [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] is no less impressed by me now. It seems I'm quite the idol for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12211;Recently, you notice that there is something wrong with Flipper. [Root.GetSheHeCap] doesn't scurry around and play like [Root.GetSheHe] used to, [Root.GetSheHe] just lies down and moans pitifully, peering at you with [Root.GetHerHis] little beady eyes. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is obviously sick and starving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12219;As the guards release you from the dungeon, you take one last look back. You see Flipper staring at you intently for a moment, [Root.GetHerHis] little eyes shining strangely in the half-darkness. Then [Root.GetSheHe] scurries away into a corner and out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12232;Languishing in the dungeon, I suddenly one day hear a small voice calling to me. It seems there is a young child in the cell next to mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_ZE_12000;Walking across the yard, I see [haughty_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstName] angrily beating a dog with a heavy stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12002;As I'm spending a pleasant moment alone with the attractive cook, young [From.GetFirstName] comes upon us. However, [From.GetSheHe] only winks in complicity and sneaks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12004;As I hit [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] turned [From.GetHerHis] anger on me but I managed to escape as the dog bit [From.GetHerHim] in the ankle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12006;As I turned, the dog bit me in the ankle and [From.GetFirstName] managed to get away, but has since been skulking around eyeing me with hatred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12010;My nannies are away and as I roam around the grounds I come upon [affectionate_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstName]. [affectionate_events_char_1.GetSheHeCap] looks up and seems interested in conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12012;[From.GetFirstName] has really nice toys but [From.GetSheHe] won't share them with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12014;I talked for a long while with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] had many funny things to tell me and we had a really good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12016;I spoke at length with [From.GetFirstName] about a great many things. We laughed a lot, and it seems I have made a new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12020;[timid_events_char_1.GetFirstName] seems very nice. Maybe I should ask if [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] wants to play?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12022;I was strangely and wrongfully accused of stealing fine foods from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]. However, young [From.GetFirstName] stepped forward to confirm that I was elsewhere at the time and so the suspicions against me were lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12024;[From.GetFirstName] came over and talked to me, asking if I wanted to be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12026;[From.GetFirstName] eventually stepped forward to defend my honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12030;There are so many fun things to do, so many forbidden things. I wonder if [rowdy_events_char_1.GetFirstName] would like to join me in some fun pranks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12032;[From.GetFirstName] seems content to let me win when we play games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12034;[From.GetFirstName] joined me and we did all kinds of pranks and tricks, everything except summoning [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB2_ZE_12034;[From.GetFirstName] didn't want to play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12036;Me and [From.GetFirstName] did all kinds of crazy and forbidden things. It was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12040;I'm out playing with [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] and we're close to the abandoned haunted house, we're not supposed to go there and [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is looking frightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12042;[From.GetFirstName] really wants to go inside the scary haunted house. It looks like it's dangerous and we have been told not to go near it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12044;[From.GetFirstName] says we have to go back now, and if we don't [From.GetSheHe] will tell on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] will get someone else to help [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12050;'Try it again,' [brooding_events_char_2.GetFirstName] says. But I can't do it! I can't whistle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12052;I woke up feeling a bit hung over, and it's already evening. I vaguely recall [From.GetFirstName] looking at me before I fell asleep. I think I had plans with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] is quietly mumbling some words and rubbing [From.GetHerHis] face. 'Sorry, I'm sorry' [From.GetSheHe] says..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12056;Waking up in my room, I seem to be missing some money. I vaguely remember [From.GetFirstName] being here. Wasn't [From.GetSheHe]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12060;I've been asked to go fetch some supplies at the market but it's a long walk. [indolent_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is already going to get other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12062;Today me and [From.GetFirstName] spent some time outside cutting down trees, no complaints from the young [From.GetBoyGirl] and work was finished early.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] seemed worried and brought me some tea. I have to drink it to get better. I also got some freshly baked bread for when I feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12066;[From.GetFirstName] was happy when I brought [From.GetHerHim] some tea and bread. [From.GetSheHe] should recover soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12070;It's late at night and I get out of bed to use the chamberpot. [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] starts calling my name and I see a man hiding under the dining table. He notices me and whispers 'psst, come over here'. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12072;After some hours running errands I was heading back home with [From.GetFirstName]. Just as I told [From.GetHerHim] we were going home [From.GetSheHe] took one of the bags to help carry it without me even asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] was not happy that I ran away from [From.GetHerHim] without helping. Now I have to stay indoors all day tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12076;[From.GetFirstName] was a little bit let down that I caught up with [From.GetHerHim] and even called me a cheater. Not always winning is a good thing for children to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12080;After supper, me and [conscientious_events_char_2.GetFirstName] were supposed to help do the dishes. But [conscientious_events_char_2.GetFirstName] hid the dirty dishes and wants to go play instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12082;After supper, me and [From.GetFirstName] were forced to do dishes. But I was clever and hid them, until [From.GetFirstName] told on me and now I have to do all of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12084;[From.GetFirstName] ran away when I told on him. The others said I don't have to do all the work alone. But I was a good [Root.GetBoyGirl] for telling them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12086;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset with me and told everyone what I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12090;Food is on my plate, but steam is coming out of it. I wonder if it's safe to eat? [fussy_events_char_2.GetTitledName] is looking at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] was a bit worried about not finding [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy, but seems to have settled down and is now sound asleep. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] finally found my toy after looking for it everywhere. It was in the trash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get a new toy the next day and finally settled down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12100;I woke up early and found a sealed letter addressed to [curious_events_char_2.GetTitledName]. I wonder what it could say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12102;I come back after a day out fetching some things at the market and see [From.GetFirstName] patiently waiting for me like I asked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12104;I followed [From.GetTitledName] to the market, but then [From.GetSheHe] caught me. [From.GetSheHeCap] laughed and said I was hopeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] Seems regretful that [From.GetSheHe] disobeyed me. Hopefully It won't happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12110;Spending time with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is great. We get along so well. Even when we do chores together time goes by so fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] told me that everyone is so kind here. [From.GetSheHeCap] would make sure everyone knew how grateful [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] was humbled by the song I had written. But [From.GetSheHeCap] wanted to make a point of being just an ordinary person, and that I shouldn't give [From.GetHerHim] more credit than [From.GetSheHe] deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] seems to have lost [From.GetHerHis] overwhelming affection for me. For better or worse, it's good to learn moderation. I might not be that special after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12211;Recently, you notice that there is something wrong with Cuddles. [Root.GetSheHeCap] doesn't scurry around and play like [Root.GetSheHe] used to, [Root.GetSheHe] just lies down and moans pitifully, peering at you with [Root.GetHerHis] little beady eyes. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is obviously sick and starving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12219;As the guards release you from the dungeon, you take one last look back. You see Cuddles staring at you intently for a moment, [Root.GetHerHis] little eyes shining strangely in the half-darkness. Then [Root.GetSheHe] scurries away into a corner and out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12232;Languishing in the dungeon, I suddenly one day hear a voice calling out. It seems there is another child in these dungeons, in the cell next to mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCC_ZE_12000;Walking outside, I come upon some commoners along the road. One of them calls out, saying I look lovely today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12002;As I'm beating a rabid dog in the yard, the little cur [From.GetFirstName] runs up and starts hitting me with a stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12004;My treatment of that uppity peasant had the unfortunate effect of making more of them angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12010;As I am out playing by myself and taking a break to eat some bread I brought from the kitchens, I suddenly notice a young peasant child staring at me. [Root.GetSheHeCap] looks hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12012;Young [From.GetTitledFirstName] just walked up to me today, striking up conversation. We ended up having a long talk, about a great many things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12014;You shared your bread with the peasant child, and then you played together for several hours before parting ways. [Root.GetSheHeCap] waved happily as [Root.GetSheHe] ran home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12020;There's a big dinner feast tonight with many prominent people invited, and it has been decided that I shall perform a song in praise of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12022;[From.GetFirstName] seems to be checking me out, but doesn't come over and talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12024;A roar of laughter rolled through the hall when the guests were told that I had hid in a chest in order to avoid having to sing for them. Several of them then called me over and offered me food and candies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12030;We are playing outside today, and several of the other children are daring me to climb the tallest watchtower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12032;[From.GetFirstName] excitedly asks me if I wanted to come along and do forbidden things, pranks and the like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12034;I rapidly climbed up to the top of the tower. But when climbing down again, I slipped. The fall was very painful, but luckily I wasn't very high up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12040;I've been out fishing for hours. I still haven't caught a fish as big as that servant's child got yesterday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12044;After a few more hours, I finally feel something bite. It's a huge fish, probably the biggest fish in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] still wants to go, and will lie and say it was my idea unless I go with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12050;Everyone was busy at home, so I snuck out to the commoners market. When I got there some children were being mean to a smaller child in ragged clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12052;[From.GetFirstName] wanted to learn to whistle. After trying for a while [From.GetSheHe] asked me 'How come you can do it?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] told me that whistling is easy. That I can do it if I try. But I've tried many times already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12056;The last thing I remember before falling asleep is apologizing to [From.GetFirstName]. It seems my apology was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12060;I'm reading a poetry book in my room but the weather is so nice outside. There are some children playing in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to get some things for [From.GetHerHim] at the market as I am already going there. [From.GetSheHeCap] is even paying me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get everything if I gave [From.GetHerHim] some extra coin. I should stay in my room so no one knows I'm still home. I've got some time to spend while I'm in here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12066;Some motivation can give good results, apparently the pain is all gone now after some convincing and [From.GetFirstName] will come join me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12070;Today I had to help out digging in the garden, but gardening is boring. The gardener is boring too, but maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12072;[playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] stops calling for me after a while. The man says 'I bet you this gold coin you can't hold your breath until I'm outside'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12074;Before I knew it, the man was running out through the door. He didn't even look back once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12076;I heard noises in the middle of the night and when I got up to check on [From.GetFirstName] I had to call out several times. Then [From.GetSheHe] finally answered and I found [From.GetHerHim] under the dining table with a burglar. The guards made quick work of the burglar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12080;It's getting late but I lost my new vest when I was playing somewhere. If I come back without it everyone will think I'm sloppy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12082;After supper, me and [From.GetFirstName] had to clean up. But we hid all the dishes where no one could see and now we have been playing all evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12084;[From.GetFirstName] was angry with me, but we did finish all the work together. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] doesn't like me any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12090;I was invited to the servants' quarters to eat cake with them tonight. But just as I was going there, it started raining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12092;At the table today, [From.GetFirstName] complained about the food being too hot without even touching it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] reached over the table and touched my food with [From.GetHerHis] whole hand. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was not too hot to eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12096;I found the toy [From.GetFirstName] was crying about after going through the trash. But now [From.GetSheHe] is not satisfied because it smells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12100;Suddenly I hear something moving around in the bushes next to me. I ask who's there but there's no response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12102;I could hear someone sneaking around inside and believed it to be a burglar. When I went downstairs I discovered [From.GetFirstName] opening one of my letters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12104;[From.GetTitledName] saw me opening the letter and grabbed me by the hand. Then he cut my finger with the paper and said I should keep my nose out of others business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] seems even more interested in the letter now that [From.GetSheHe] knows it's forbidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12110;I have been praying with the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] for a while and some of the other people in the temple are getting ready to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] really loves spending time with me. I make [From.GetHerHis] days so much better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12211;Recently, you notice that there is something wrong with Smelly. [Root.GetSheHeCap] doesn't scurry around and play like [Root.GetSheHe] used to, [Root.GetSheHe] just lies down and moans pitifully, peering at you with [Root.GetHerHis] little beady eyes. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is obviously sick and starving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12219;As the guards release you from the dungeon, you take one last look back. You see Smelly staring at you intently for a moment, [Root.GetHerHis] little eyes shining strangely in the half-darkness. Then [Root.GetSheHe] scurries away into a corner and out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCD_ZE_12002;As I'm beating a rabid dog in the yard, little [From.GetFirstName] runs up and joins in the beating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12004;My treatment of that uppity peasant really put him and the others in their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12012;Young [From.GetTitledFirstName] just walked up to me today, and as I was about to greet [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] just stuck [From.GetHerHis] tongue out and ran away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12014;You shared your bread with the child and then you played together for a while, until your nannies came and angrily interrupted you. As your friend ran away, the nannies said they'd tell [Educator.GetTitledFirstName] that you had been bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12022;[From.GetFirstName] came over to me and said [From.GetSheHe] wanted us to be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12024;The guests were all very offended at my refusal to sing for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12032;[From.GetFirstName] asks me if I wanted to play dice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12034;Agile as a squirrel, I rapidly climbed up the tower and then down again. Everyone was very impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12044;I'm just about to give up, but then it happened. I caught a fish, but it's not very big.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] said I was right and we went back home, away from the scary house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12052;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to teach [From.GetHerHim] how to whistle. I must have inspired [From.GetHerHim], now [From.GetSheHe] has been at it for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] said that not everyone learns to whistle. Some can never do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12056;I wake up, and [From.GetFirstName] is still by my side. [From.GetSheHeCap] has brought me some water to drink, and covered me with a blanket. I don't deserve treatment like this. But if [From.GetSheHe] sees good in me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] came with me to the market today, we both had to go get some groceries and had time to talk a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] didn't want to help me out. [From.GetSheHeCap] is already heading out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12072;[From.GetFirstName] was not in [From.GetHerHis] his room and I was starting to get worried. When [From.GetSheHe] finally answered I found [From.GetHerHim] staring at a burglar who was trying to hide from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] seemed shocked when [From.GetSheHe] found me. The guards came and took the man hiding under the table. They said he was a bad man and I should stay away from strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12084;I was out too long in the evening, and it hurts when I breathe. The adults say I have to rest a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] was very happy at dinner today, eating with great appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] seemed angry with me and told me to wait until I felt the food's temperature was just right. Now its cool enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] finally fell asleep after I found [From.GetHerHis] toy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12102;I had expected some letters today but couldn't find any. I was suspicious at first but when I asked [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] pointed to a table where they were already sorted for me, untouched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12104;[From.GetTitledName] came downstairs just as I was opening the letter but [From.GetSheHe] wasn't angry with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me it is considered rude to go through other people's belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12106;After talking to [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] seems to understand the concept of privacy better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] and I always get along well and now [From.GetSheHe] told me that we should stay friends forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCE_ZE_12054;The bullies all scatter when I tell them to stop. The small child looks at me and asks for food without mentioning the others and what they did. Is this how commoners live?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12056;[From.GetFirstName] seems a bit frustrated by [From.GetHerHis] failed attempts. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't seem to respond well to my encouraging words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12064;The other children are chasing each other, lots of running and jumping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12074;We had some time to play before we finished all of the work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12084;Yes! I found my vest and no one will even know it was missing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12094;I ran very fast and I made it in time. We had lots of fun and the servants seem to like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12096;No matter what I do or avoid doing, there seems to be no good way to make [From.GetFirstName] relax. [From.GetSheHeCap] won't eat at all now and I have no more energy to deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12104;It was a big disgusting rat. It hissed and bit me in the hand and now it hurts, a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12114;After a whole night of religious ritual, I started getting hungry and my mind wandered. Maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is happy with the time I spent here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCF_ZE_12056;[From.GetFirstName] went back to [From.GetHerHis] room to do other things now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12074;She was not ticklish, and now she is telling everybody what a hassle I am to have around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12094;I made it to the servants' quarters, but I got very wet. Then we had a good time and they felt sorry for me having to go out in the cold..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] finally decided to eat [From.GetHerHis] food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12104;I found an injured bird, it seems to have fallen from its nest. Maybe I can keep it as a pet while it recovers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_12000;It's inappropriate, and I will tell [haughty_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12002;I'll catch the brat and give [From.GetHerHim] a good hiding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12004;The [GetRootFromInsult]! I will tell everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12010;I could let [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim] play with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12012;Yes, that would be nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12014;It's so nice to share with others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12016;Let's play again sometime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12020;No one would listen to me anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12022;The little wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12024;What? It's not my problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12026;I shall remember this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12030;I'll tell [rowdy_events_char_1.GetHerHim] to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12030_TOOLTIP1;The matter escalates...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12032;I'll tell [From.GetHerHim] to get lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12034;Fist fiiiiight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12036;Come on then, you [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12040;It will fit if you help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12042;No child tells me what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12044;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s a meanie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12046;Well [From.GetSheHe]'s stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12050;Pour some water on [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12052;I'll show [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12054;My life will never be like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12056;I have seen better days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12060;Ouch, my stomach hurts suddenly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12062;Indolent brat, I'll show [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12064;Now I can't use my arm to cut trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12066;Hopeless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12070;Race me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12072;Race [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12074;[From.GetSheHeCap] is so fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12076;It will change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12080;I will sort it out for [conscientious_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12082;I'll mess up [From.GetHerHis] chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12084;Now I have to clean again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12086;Maybe I shouldn't have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12090;I can't sleep without it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12092;I'll offer to buy a new one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12094;It's not the same, I want my toy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12096;There is no pleasing this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12100;I will follow [curious_events_char_1.GetHerHim] to see what [curious_events_char_1.GetSheHe] is up to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12102;I'll grab [From.GetHerHim] by the ear and have a serious talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12104;[From.GetSheHeCap] is hiding something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12106;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12110;I'll write [idolizer_events_char_1.GetHerHim] a song!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12112;I can tell stories to impress [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12114;I wish [From.GetSheHe] was my [From.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12116;I hope I'm a good influence on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12210;I name you Flipper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12211;I'll share my food with [Root.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12219;I'll never forget you, Flipper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12220;Yes, I will serve you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12221;I will use force to find them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12222;I am a hero, his most valuable servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12223;If I hide in the corner maybe he won't find me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12225;I must strike back with all my power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12226;I rule in this dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12227;I should never have challenged him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12230;I'll try and talk to [event_ze_12230_prisoner.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12232;Finally someone to talk to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12234;I feel less lonely now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12236;Everybody hates me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_12000;It's our secret, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12002;It doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12004;I'll hide so [From.GetSheHe] doesn't find me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12010;Yes, I have nicer toys than [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12012;No, those toys are silly anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12014;Let's play again soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12016;What a nice child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12020;I must speak up for [timid_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12022;Alas, I cannot blame the child for being timid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12024;I should step forward now, it's not too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12026;I can tell it took courage to speak up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12030;It doesn't matter, [rowdy_events_char_1.GetSheHe] can win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12032;I'll just avoid [From.GetHerHim] from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12034;I'll walk away, it's not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12036;Let's do it again sometime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12040;Give the hat to someone younger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12042;Give in to demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12044;Someone else can make it fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12046;At least [From.GetSheHe] knows what [From.GetSheHe] wants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12050;Leave [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim] alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12052;I'm sorry [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12054;Take some money while [From.GetSheHe] is sleeping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12056;That brat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12060;I'll cut down the biggest one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12062;Maybe there's something wrong with [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12064;I'm coming, I'm coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12066;Poor child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12070;Help [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim] with the bags.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12072;Lecture [From.GetHerHim] about responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] is a cheater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12076;[From.GetSheHeCap] will thank me later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12080;So much to do outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12082;Cleaning is not my virtue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12084;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a meanie and I will tell everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12086;That little monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12090;I'm a big [Root.GetBoyGirl] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12092;Guess I have to go find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12094;Ok then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12096;What a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12100;I can play all day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12102;I can't blame [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12104;I should apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12106;There is hope for the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12110;I should tell the courtiers that I like it here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12112;I'm just a responsible adult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12114;What a dufus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12116;The older they get...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12210;I name you Cuddles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12211;There's not enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12219;I'll never forget you, Cuddles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12220;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12221;I shall use my cunning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12225;I must evade, dodge and use my cunning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12230;What's the point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12232;I have no need for friends here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_12000;I'll pick up a stick and beat [haughty_events_char_1.GetHerHim] instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12002;I should bring [From.GetHerHim] some candy later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12004;[From.GetSheHeCap] will find I am a fierce enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12010;I'll talk to [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12012;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12014;I want more friends like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12020;I'll wait a little, [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] could come to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12022;All is good then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12024;Umm... no, I have to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12030;I'll ask [rowdy_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12032;That's all fine then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12034;We should do this every day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12040;Go inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12042;I don't want to go in there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12044;Come, or I'll say it was your idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12046;I'm so angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12050;How come you can do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12052;I feel sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] is not a grown up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12056;I'm in a sad state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12060;Pay [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim] to get your groceries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12060_TOOLTIP;May not take the offer.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12062;Job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12064;Oh tea and fresh bread!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12066;Suddenly better, that's great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12070;Hide with the man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12072;Bless the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12074;Everyone here is so boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12076;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I found [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12080;I have to tell on [conscientious_events_char_2.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12082;Unfair! I'll run away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12084;I will do it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12090;It's too hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12092;One more step towards growing up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12094;It stinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12096;It stinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12100;Place it on the table and ask about it later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12102;I should give [From.GetHerHim] some treats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12104;[From.GetSheHeCap] is so much fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12106;Maybe I should have dealt with it differently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12110;Everything is better when [idolizer_events_char_2.GetSheHe] is around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12112;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a joy to have around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12114;What a hero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12116;What a sweetie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12210;I name you Smelly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12219;I'll never forget you, Smelly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_ZE_12000;I think I'll join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12002;I'll show the [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12004;Now, where are my toys...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12010;I'll stick my tongue out at [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim] and run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12012;How nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12014;I'll come see you again tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12020;Yes, we should play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12022;I'll go and talk to [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12024;Yes, let's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12030;Or maybe we should just play dice instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12032;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12034;That was fun, now let's play dice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12040;Turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12042;I can do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12044;You're right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12046;Don't mess with [Root.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12050;Keep trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12052;It's easy, you can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12054;Comfort [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12056;I can change. I will change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12060;Join up with [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12062;Very easy money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12064;Maybe I should help [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12070;Answer [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12072;Easy money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12074;I win, easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12080;No one will find out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12082;Stupid dishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12084;I can spend time reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12090;I should trust [fussy_events_char_2.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12092;Touch the food to make sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12094;Oh I thought I had lost it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12096;Oh I thought I had lost it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12100;I should find out. It could be important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12102;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] to be less nosy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12104;That was a secret letter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12106;A step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12110;I will stay friends with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetHerHim] forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12112;I'll kiss [From.GetFirstName] on the cheek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12114;Grownups can do anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12116;I don't like [From.GetHerHim] anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12210;Hello, food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_ZE_12000;I'll see him punished for addressing me like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12000_TOOLTIP1;Peasants get angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12000_TOOLTIP2;Peasants are subdued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12002;How weak, how adorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12004;We'll deal with them as they deserve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12010;I'll share my bread with [Root.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12010_TOOLTIP1;You do a good deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12010_TOOLTIP2;You do a good deed, but someone sees you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12012;Begone, [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12014;This was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020;No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020_TOOLTIP1;Guests are amused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020_TOOLTIP2;Guests are offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12022;What's [From.GetSheHe] staring at? It's annoying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12024;Oh yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12030;I'm not afraid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12030_TOOLTIP1;Slipped while climbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12030_TOOLTIP2;Up and down like a squirrel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12032;No, I'm a good [Root.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12034;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040;If I wait long enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP1;Catch something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP2;Waste time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12044;They will tell stories of today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12050;Stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12052;Not everyone can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12054;Everyone can do it but me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12056;Many things seem to trouble this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12060;Go see what they are doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12062;I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12064;I could use a nap right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070;I can tickle her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP1;Gardener is tickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP2;Gardener doesn't appreciate tickling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12072;Call for [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12074;I wonder who that was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080;I have to go look for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080_TOOLTIP1;Becoming ill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080_TOOLTIP2;Successful find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12082;We had so much fun together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12084;The grownups are happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090;I can make it if I run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP1;Make it with no effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP2;Out in the cold too long;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12092;Let [From.GetHerHim] wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12094;But now [From.GetSheHe] touched it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12096;Hopeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12100;I should investigate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12100_TOOLTIP1;Find something nasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12100_TOOLTIP2;Find a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12102;[From.GetSheHeCap] could use some practice reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12104;It wasn't mine to read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12110;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will notice my dedication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12112;[From.GetSheHeCap] is kind. But I don't feel that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12114;[From.GetSheHeCap] is the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF_ZE_12000;I'll nod and accept the compliment graciously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12002;There's room for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12004;I know how to handle these things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12010;I'll leave before [Root.GetSheHe] tries to steal from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12012;What a strange child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12014;But [Root.GetSheHe] is my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12020;Yes, I will sing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12022;How nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12024;I don't care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12030;No... it's too high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12032;Sounds like fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12034;Owww!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12040;Go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12044;At least I tried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12050;Noone can know I'm here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12052;[From.GetSheHeCap]'ll get it right soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12054;I am good at other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12056;I'm glad [From.GetSheHe] doesn't dwell too much on these things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12060;Keep on reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] is so kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12064;Read a book about money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12070;Hard work is good for discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12072;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12074;Nothing has to be boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12080;I can explain when I get back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12084;I feel terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12090;I don't want to get wet, I'll wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12092;That's nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12094;I guess it's fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12096;Peace at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12100;I should tell someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12102;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a joy to have around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12104;It's probably a boring letter anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12110;I can collect alms to keep for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12112;I can always count on [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12114;This is not what I meant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG_ZE_12034;Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12054;Donate some money for food and clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12064;I guess I'll have to go then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12074;She is stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12084;Next time I will take my things with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12094;But now some of it is too cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12104;I'm glad I found out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12114;I shouldn't have said anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12054;Tell child to ask their mom and dad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12064;Maybe I'll just watch them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12094;Alright, I'll eat the cold food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12104;I was meant to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12114;I am being tested, I must stay here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTI_ZE_12064;I'll join in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12094;Yum yum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12104;What a great day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12114;I can't miss fencing practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTJ_ZE_12094;I don't feel so good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZE_2100;I've gotten an increased amount of questions from [From.GetFirstName] lately about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and the rituals of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2101;Over the past weeks I've grown more and more curious about the beliefs and rituals of my [GetFromRelation]. Today [From.GetSheHe] finally began to answer my repeated questions about [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2102;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName] has, through the teachings of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], been studying the principles of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2120;During the past few months, [From.GetFirstName] has shown dogged determination in [From.GetHerHis] studies of our language and has now also expressed a desire to study the history of my people's ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2121;Pleased with the progress I'm making with learning the local language, [From.GetFirstName] has brought me a book about the ancestry of the [From.Culture.GetName] people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2122;Rumor has it that your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been influenced by [From.GetHerHis] guardian's splendor. It is said that [From.GetFirstName] is now considered properly [From.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2130;To the [GetFromFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick],\n\nI write to ask for your permission to give my ward, [From.GetFirstName], a proper [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.Culture.GetName] upbringing.\n\nSigned [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2131;Dear [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick],\n\nYour initiative to teach [FromFrom.GetFirstName] about Heritage is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2140;To the [GetFromFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick],\n\nI write to ask for your permission to give my ward, [From.GetFirstName], a proper [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] upbringing and learn the ways of [FromFrom.Religion.GetScriptureName].\n\nSigned [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2141;Dear [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick],\n\nYour initiative to teach [FromFrom.GetFirstName] about your religion is most welcome and I accept your proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_2132;Dear, [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWhile I admire your enthusiasm for the upbringing of [FromFrom.GetFirstName] I do believe that it's best to continue with the current plan of education for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_ZE_2132;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nClearly you can understand what an outlandish suggestion you are making. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is supposed to grow up to be a fine and cultured [FromFrom.GetManWoman], something which will obviously not be possible with your strange rituals and repulsive manners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_2142;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI am certain you can understand what a blasphemous suggestion you are making! [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is supposed to grow up to be a fine and dutiful [FromFrom.GetManWoman], something which will obviously not be possible with your strange rituals and profane manners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_2100;Time to teach [From.GetHerHim] about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2101;Glory to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2120;I should encourage it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2120_TT;ยงY[From.GetTitledName]ยง! becomes ยงY[Root.Culture.GetName]ยง!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2121;How fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2122;I hope it's a beneficial influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2130;That seems appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2131;[FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] will be taught well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2132;Not the response I had hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_2100;It will be better for [From.GetHerHim] not to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2101;What repugnant ideas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2120;Make sure [From.GetSheHe] learns about [From.GetHerHis] own customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2121;I'd rather study my own family's heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2130;I will never allow [From.GetHerHim] to turn into a savage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2132;What a rude response!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
