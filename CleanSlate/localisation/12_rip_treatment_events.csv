EVTDESC_RIP_11030;The many blisters on your... body have faded, almost all of them gone now. So much for Syphilis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11035;Your Court Physician [court_physician.GetBestName] has come to see you and offers treatment for your illness. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] explains that there are several different types of treatment [court_physician.GetSheHe] can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040;[court_physician.GetBestName] looked me deep in the eyes before he forced me to drink the dirty water he had brought from his office. It was apparently filled with tiny creatures which should drive out the disease demons within me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_1;The pot which [court_physician.GetBestName] brought with [court_physician.GetHerHim] to your chambers emitted a strange buzzing sound. Before you could stop [court_physician.GetHerHim] [court_physician.GetSheHe] threw it on the floor, where it exploded in a cloud of pottery shards and swarm of furious bees. As your physician fled the room, you remained their only target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_2;You could not believe your eyes when [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] pulled a severed hand from [court_physician.GetHerHis] satchel. The black spots on its finger sent chills down your spine and you demanded to know where [court_physician.GetSheHe] got it from. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] only hushed you and proceeded to rub the severed hand against your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_3;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] presented you with a potion of the most peculiar sorts. It had neither odor nor taste and possessed the appearance of liquid silver. The metallic potion was easy enough to ingest and you could not understand why this was the risky treatment option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_5;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] insisted that the only cure for your condition was a naked midnight run. During the next full moon [court_physician.GetSheHe] forced you to undress and sprint through the wilderness. "Do not stop until your legs give out under you!" [court_physician.GetSheHe] yelled after you. "Expel the evil through your sweat!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_6;The powder was yellow and had a delicious scent. You were distraught to see [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] mix it with brimstone and sprinkle it over the still tepid gall-bladder of a beaver. The animal had been found rabid, frothing from the mouth, exhibiting clear signs of the illness. "We fight evil with evil, [Root.GetMasterMistress].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_8;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] approached you with a small knife. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] held your arm steady and made a precise incision, barely breaking your skin. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] then proceeded to press something against the wound. It looked like diseased tissue and you shuddered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_9;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] handed you a plate with a gray powdery substance on it. Apparently it consisted of ground-up scabs from a person in a worse state than you. [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] showed no indication of joking as [court_physician.GetSheHe] told you to lean in and inhale as much as you could though your nose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_10;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] made you drink a draught of poppy before strapping you down on [court_physician.GetHerHis] operating table. You almost dozed off while [court_physician.GetSheHe] prepared [court_physician.GetHerHis] instruments, but when [court_physician.GetSheHe] raised a scalpel towards your eye, you felt wide awake. "I am sorry, my [Root.GetLordLady], but we must remove the root of the problem.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_11;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] gave you a draught which tasted most peculiar. It made you feel numb and your eyelids started drooping. "I apologize, my [Root.GetLordLady], but you do not want to be awake for this next part" [court_physician.GetSheHe] said. Panic hit you and you tried to get up from the operating table, but your limbs would not obey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_12;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName]'s assistant assured [court_physician.GetHerHim] you were asleep. However, [court_physician.GetFirstName]'s potion had failed to fully take effect– even though you could neither speak nor move, you were still aware of everything they did to you. You tried to scream and thrash, but you were a prisoner in your own body. The procedure seemed to last forever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_13;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] informed you that [court_physician.GetSheHe] had identified the tainted tissue which was the root of your disease, and that removing it would most likely cure you. You were most pleased and agreed to the surgery. However, in hindsight, you wish that [court_physician.GetFirstName] told you that "the tissue" was your face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_14;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] buckled the last strap, securing you on the operating table. "I will not lie to you, my [Root.GetLordLady]. This will be excruciatingly painful, but it must be done." You tried to protest when [court_physician.GetFirstName] brought out the saw, but due to the calming potion [court_physician.GetSheHe] had made you drink, you slurred the words beyond comprehension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11040_15;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] buckled the last strap, securing you on the operating table. "I will not lie to you, my [Root.GetLordLady]. This will be excruciatingly painful, but it must be done." You tried to protest when [court_physician.GetFirstName] brought out the saw, but due to the calming potion [court_physician.GetSheHe] had made you drink, you slurred the words beyond comprehension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041;[court_physician.GetBestName] gave me a mix of herbal tea to drink daily and I was told to relax and avoid food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_1;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] insisted that your humors were out of balance and that the best way to restore them would be through bloodletting. After consulting the astronomical charts, [court_physician.GetSheHe] decided that you should be bled from your armpits and temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_2;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] told you to undress and then kneel with your buttocks raised. That was awkward enough, but when you saw the instrument in [court_physician.GetHerHis] hands you almost bolted. [court_physician.GetFirstName] must have noticed, because [court_physician.GetSheHe] patted you calmingly on the shoulder and told you to stop clenching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_3;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] entered your chambers with an earthenware jar cradled in [court_physician.GetHerHis] arms and came to sit by your bed. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] pulled a leech from the jar and gave it a most tender look before carefully placing it on your face. "Remain still, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Better not disturb their feeding.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_4;When [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] entered your chambers [court_physician.GetSheHe] was followed by an air most foul. The stench seemed to originate from the jar in [court_physician.GetHerHis] hands– "a mixture of cow's dung and herbs for your poultice, [Root.GetMasterMistress]". When [court_physician.GetFirstName] proceeded to smear it on your chest you almost retched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_5;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] presented you with the charred carcass of a cat and prompted you to dig in. As you ate, [court_physician.GetSheHe] told you how [court_physician.GetSheHe] had chased the plump feline around your holdings for hours. You felt as if [court_physician.GetSheHe] wanted praise for [court_physician.GetHerHis] hard work, but the vile taste of the meal kept you silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_6;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] brought a croaking bucket to your chambers and told you to expose your upper body. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] grabbed a toad, gutted it with a deft hand and proceeded to place the still twitching carcass on your chest. [court_physician.GetFirstName] continued until the bucket was empty and your torso was covered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_7;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] came to your chambers and offered you a draught which was yellow in color. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] told you to pinch your nose as you drank it. When the tepid liquid passed your lips you almost immediately spat it out again. You demanded to know the content and [court_physician.GetSheHe] revealed that it was fresh urine from a pregnant sow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_8;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] lowered [court_physician.GetHerHis] hand into the bucket [court_physician.GetSheHe] brought to to your chambers. When [court_physician.GetSheHe] pulled it out again a little fish was wriggling between [court_physician.GetHerHis] fingers. "Open wide" [court_physician.GetSheHe] prompted you and dropped it in your mouth. You struggled not to retch as it tickled the back of your throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_10;The red powder was tantalizing in color. A servant had made the mistake of tasting it in its pure form - his tongue had swollen up badly and [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] had chastized him firmly for it. [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] poured the spice into a chalice of water and stirred it meticulously, before feeding you a spoonful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_11;Your eyes widened when [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] led a goat into your chambers. The foul smell of its flatulence made you both cover your noses, but the physician pulled your hand away. "Apologies, my [Root.GetLordLady], this is the treatment." [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] recommended deep breaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11041_13;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] brought you a concoction made from buckthorn and senna. At first you thought the potion ineffectual, but later the same day you felt a churning in your bowels which sent you running for the privy. As you howled in anguish, [court_physician.GetFirstName] assured you that the foulness was expelled with your feces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042;[court_physician.GetBestName] sang for me a bit while [court_physician.GetSheHe] tucked me in. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] said that rest is enough to cure any ailment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_1;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] was convinced that the best course of treatment would be some rest. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] surrounded you in soft pillows and gently tucked you in under many layers of blankets. Before [court_physician.GetFirstName] left your chambers, [court_physician.GetSheHe] pulled your curtains shut. It was noon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_2;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] contributed your ailments to an unsound diet. To revitalize your body [court_physician.GetSheHe] insisted you consume only raw vegetables and herbal teas for a fortnight. So as not to tempt you, [court_physician.GetSheHe] confiscated your stash of treats. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] never returned them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_3;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] told you to lie down on your bed and then to offer [court_physician.GetHerHim] your hands. Firmly [court_physician.GetSheHe] rubbed and slapped your palms until they were red, and then repeated the treatment on your soles. As a finishing touch [court_physician.GetSheHe] pinched you gently up and down your limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_4;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] offered you a clear potion in a gilded vial. As you had tasted some previous remedied of [court_physician.GetFirstName]'s you were worried at first, but as you drank it you could detect neither odor nor taste. You inquired about the ingredients, but [court_physician.GetSheHe] told you that it was a secret recipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_5;Relax your breathing, [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] instructed you. The feather in [court_physician.GetHerHis] hand looked almost ethereal as [court_physician.GetSheHe] began to gently brush you under your nose. "Evil, begone!" [court_physician.GetSheHe] urged, as the sneezing began.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_6;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] arranged a small ceremony in your name. Once your family and closest entourage were all gathered in the main hall, the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] gave a sermon highlighting your virtue and benevolence. Their united prayers will surely speed your recovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_7;You spent many evenings with [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName], as [court_physician.GetSheHe] recited you stories from [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], until you were fast asleep. The routine has been comforting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_8;[court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] called on the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] to bring forth the finest singer in the court, which turned out to be a young child with a bright tenor voice. For several days in a row, the child sang you to sleep. How soothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_9;The water was steaming hot when [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] let the honey drip into it. It dissolved almost instantly, but [court_physician.GetSheHe] stirred it for a long time. "That's it?", you finally asked. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] nodded, and you drank the tea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11042_10;The steam rose from the cup as [court_physician.GetTitledFirstName] stirred the green powder in it. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] explained the healing properties of the herb at length, before motioning for you to drink it. "The root is in there, too", [court_physician.GetSheHe] boastfully revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11045_cancer;[court_physician.GetTitledName] thinks your symptoms may point to Cancer. [court_physician.GetSheHeCap] insists that you follow [court_physician.GetHerHis] instructions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
