HF_100_DESC;A wandering warrior has requested an audience. It appears as if the entire court is abuzz with stories of [invited_character.GetHerHis] exploits, this [invited_character.GetFirstNameWithNick] is seemingly of great renown. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] wishes to swear fealty to me, having heard of my relation to the legendary [target_bloodline_founder.GetFullName]! I truly am blessed by my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_110_DESC;The blood of [target_bloodline_founder.GetFullName] flows through my veins.

HF_120_DESC;There are many legends about the great [target_bloodline_founder.GetManWoman] whose blood I share. A particular story has been circulating at court lately. It focuses on an epic feat where [target_bloodline_founder.GetFirstName] proves [target_bloodline_founder.GetHerHis] strength of character. The more I hear, the more I wish to emulate [target_bloodline_founder.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF24000;Since [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s gruesome execution, the most baffling rumor has been spreading throughout my realm. People around [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have come to believe that the traits I share with the old tyrant of Akragas are no mere coincidence, but rather the proof that I must be a descendant of the infamous Phalaris.\n\nIf I allow such rumors to keep spreading, my entire dynasty's reputation might be stained forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24001;I was shocked to hear what fate [From.GetTitledFirstName] has in store for me. This deranged lunatic plans to lock me inside a brazen bull and cook me alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24003;I was shocked to hear what fate [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has in store for me. This deranged lunatic plans to lock me inside a brazen bull and cook me alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is pushed screaming and kicking inside the brazen bull in the middle of the throne room, under the silent watch of all my courtiers. The [From.GetManWoman]'s desperate shrieking as [From.GetSheHe] is roasted alive inside the contraption soon turns into harmonious bellowing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24005;The guards drag me out of the dungeon and to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. My hopes for freedom vanish quickly as I see the imposing figure of the brass bull staring at me from the middle of the hall, surrounded by fearful courtiers. The guards drag me towards the statue while the executioner starts stoking the fires beneath it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24006;Foul rumors are spreading from Sicily. The once prosperous Mediterranean isle has been fallen into the hands of a cruel [From.GetManWoman], who claims to be a descendant of the [pagan_group.GetName] Tyrants of old. \n\nConsumed by paranoid delusions and sadistic fantasies, [From.GetSheHe] has killed hundreds of [From.GetHerHis] own subjects for the most trivial of slights. \nMost of [From.GetHerHis] victims have met their end in the fiery belly of [From.GetHerHis] brazen bull, symbol of [From.GetHerHis] degenerate dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24028;Far from being the least bit ashamed of [Root.GetHerHis] murderous inclinations, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has started to openly display [Root.GetHerHis] victims as a warning towards [Root.GetHerHis] enemies. \n[Root.GetSheHeCap] has dedicated an entire wing of [Root.GetHerHis] palace to host the embalmed corpses of [Root.GetHerHis] kills, propped by [Root.GetHerHis] servants around a large table, wearing fancy outfits, immortalized in an ever-expanding feast of death.\nMany travelers have left [Root.Capital.GetName] horrified after a visit through this horrifying room, spreading its infamous tale across the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24029;As unassuming and welcoming as [Root.Capital.GetName]'s palace might look on the outside, few visitors enter it without a heavy feeling of dread clouding their minds.\nThe manor of the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has become quite infamous for swallowing its guests without much warning. Nobody has ever found proof of the [Root.GetTitle]'s misdeed, or ever heard [Root.GetHerHim] order an execution, yet all [Root.GetHerHis] enemies have the alarming tendency to disappear in mysterious circumstances and never be heard from ever again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24030;It is hard to reconcile [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s charming reputation as a guest with [Root.GetHerHis] equally notorious thirst for blood.\nTold to be a nightmarish creature of darkness, the [Root.GetLordLady] of [Root.Capital.GetName] stalks [Root.GetHerHis] preys with skill and finesse, gaining their trust and toying with them until [Root.GetHerHis] boredom forces [Root.GetHerHim] to end the suffering of one victim and move to the next.\nProtected by [Root.GetHerHis] rank and power, this repulsive murderer has been able to terrorize [From.GetHerHis] lands for years, becoming infamous throughout the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24032;Few can boast to have accomplished as much as [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has at such a young age as [Root.GetSheHe] did.\nHaving ascended to power while still a child, this prodigious ruler has been able to lead [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] through a series of astounding victories against its neighboring realms. \nClearly, this child was born for war and conquest, and there is no telling what [Root.GetSheHe] will be able to accomplish during the rest of [Root.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24034;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has risen as a shining example of knightly virtue that will not soon be forgotten.\nA paragon of gallantry and valor on the battlefield as well as at court, [Root.GetSheHe] is living proof that ruthlessness and deceit are no requirement to excel on the field of battle. With a pure heart filled with the glory of Our Lord and an unwavering discipline, tempered by countless battles and tournaments, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has triumphed over [Root.GetHerHis] enemies time and again, inspiring many young [Root.GetMenWomen] to follow in [Root.GetHerHis] footsteps and sing of [From.GetHerHis] legendary feats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24035;Scarcely any ruler bordering [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] sleeps well at night, tormented by the dreams of conquest of their terrible neighbor. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has carved a blood-soaked path through the lands of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], earning the fame of a ruthless and fearsome warrior.\n None is safe from [Root.GetHerHis] reach, and it is hard to say if [Root.GetHerHis] thirst for conquest will ever be satisfied. A cunning and relentless commander, [Root.GetSheHe] has overseen countless victories on the battlefield and acquired immortal glory for [Root.GetHerselfHimself] as well as all [Root.GetHerHis] descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24036;By emulating some of the greatest and wisest Kings of old, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has achieved a perfect balance between wisdom and grit, becoming both a scholar and a warrior, and applying the vast depths of [Root.GetHerHis] knowledge to lead [Root.GetHerHis] armies to countless victories and earn eternal glory for [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty.\nFew people can claim to have accomplished as much as [Root.GetSheHe] has within their lifetime, excelling both in spiritual and political disciplines to such an extent. \n[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s name will surely be remembered in many legends by future generations as that of a respected and fearsome warrior-philosopher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24038;With the child having ascended to the throne at such an early age, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s inheritance was initially perceived by many as the beginning of a period of instability and fear for the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Instead, the child [Root.GetTitle] ushered a new era of peace and prosperity throughout [Root.GetHerHis] realm, ruling firmly and kindly, and showing a wisdom far beyond [Root.GetHerHis] years.\nMost of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects now praise [Root.GetHerHim] for [Root.GetHerHis] enlightened rule, claiming that [Root.GetSheHe] must have been blessed by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24040;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has risen as a symbol of peace and prosperity for all the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThrough diplomacy and intimidation, [Root.GetSheHe] has managed to maintain [Root.GetHerHis] realm at peace for as long as most people can remember.\n[Root.GetHerHisCap] tireless devotion to the protection of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects has earned [Root.GetHerHim] the respect of many and ensured that [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty will forever be associated with safety and tranquility, and [Root.GetHerHim] as the benevolent [Root.GetFatherMother] of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24041;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has risen as a symbol of peace and prosperity for all the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThrough diplomacy and intimidation, [Root.GetSheHe] has managed to maintain [Root.GetHerHis] realm at peace for as long as most people can remember, enriching both [Root.GetHerselfHimself] as well as [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.\nRather than waste lives and wealth after elusive victories on the field of battle, [Root.GetSheHe] has decided to share [Root.GetHerHis] riches with [Root.GetHerHis] subjects, in an endless cavalcade of feasts and fairs that have earned [Root.GetHerHim] the love and reverence of many people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24042;Rather than wasting lives and wealth after dreams of new conquest, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has dedicated [Root.GetHerHis] life to the improvement of [Root.GetHerHis] own realm, founding several new cities during the course of [Root.GetHerHis] reign, strengthening the infrastructure of [Root.GetHerHis] roads and holdings, and improving the living conditions of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects beyond measure.\nThanks to [Root.GetHerHis] efforts, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has grown to be a much more prosperous and populous realm than it would have otherwise been.\nThousands of new settlers will forever remember [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s vital contribution to the creation of their new homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24043;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts in the construction of new fortifications aimed at the defense of [Root.GetHerHis] realm have immortalized [Root.GetHerHis] name as an ingenious and considerate planner.\n[Root.GetSheHeCap] has populated many of the hills of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with impregnable embodiments of [Root.GetHerHis] wondrous technological ingenuity, projecting a sense of safety to all [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.\nFor some time now, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has acquired a reputation as a realm of towers and stone walls, secure from even the wildest horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24044;In an unparalleled show of devotion, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has dedicated [Root.GetHerHis] life to the construction of sacred monuments honoring the glory of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\nScarcely any town within [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is beyond walking distance from a sanctuary of some sort, and every major city in the realm has come to host the majestic sight of a great cathedral.\nSeveral members of the clergy have celebrated [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s virtuous projects on multiple occasions, and the [Root.GetTitle] has become a symbol of craftsmanship dedicated to heavenly pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24045;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s name has become synonymous with war and mayhem.\nDriven by an insatiable thirst for blood and conquest, this [Root.GetManWoman] is said to possess both the ferocity of a lion and the cunning of a fox, pursuing [Root.GetHerHis] mad ambitions with no concern for mercy and honor.\n[Root.GetHerHisCap] infamous exploits and the vile tactics with which [Root.GetSheHe] has achieved many victories on the field have stained [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24046;Through [Root.GetHerHis] just and considerate rule, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to maintain [Root.GetHerHis] realm in a state of peace and prosperity for several years.\nDespite being a distant and cold ruler, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has had a reign surprisingly devoid of malignant rumors or dissident factions.\nMost people assume that this is but the natural consequence of a wise [Root.GetManWoman] being in charge, yet an unspoken sense of uneasiness appears to loom over the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24047;A patron of the crafts, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has brought unparalleled fame to [Root.GetHerHis] family with [Root.GetHerHis] unfettered patronage of countless enterprises, overseeing the construction of new temples, castles and entire cities all across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\nThanks to [Root.GetHerHis] wise investments, the realm's wealth has been increased beyond measure, and for this [Root.GetSheHe] is sure to be remembered for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24048;Sacrifices must be made when creating something great.\nNo one more than [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has exemplified this concept during the course of [Root.GetHerHis] bloodied realm.\nThe [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is celebrated as the founder of many marvels of modern architecture, yet [Root.GetSheHe] is also associated with several violent deaths and sinister plots.\nIt has become a common saying for the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] that any new building ordered by the [Root.GetTitle] is yet another tomb where [Root.GetSheHe] will hide the remains of [Root.GetHerHis] next victim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24052;While avoiding being forgotten entirely is my primary concern, it is also equally important for me to think about how I actually do wish posterity to think of me. How can I make sure that when I die, future generations will speak in awe and wonder about my accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle], and feel inspired to emulate me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24053;It is clear that only by cultivating an impeccable reputation I will be able to make the memory of my name stand the test of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24054;In order to immortalize my name I must leave an indelible mark on [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], improving my realm beyond what even my predecessors dared to accomplish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24055;Only through decisive action and by achieving complete control over my realm I will be able to immortalize my name for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24056;It has come to my attention that many of the realm's laws handling petty disputes are old and obsolete. Revising our legal system to provide fair and satisfying judgment will certainly improve the conditions of my subjects and increase the prestige of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24057;The great legal reform of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is finally reaching its conclusion, yet new issues seem to have stemmed by my undertaking. There is a growing concern amongst the nobility that these new laws are too lax and might encourage peasants to avoid their responsibilities and acquire seditious tendencies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24058;By revolutionizing the legal system of [Root.GetHerHis] realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has enshrined [Root.GetHerHis] name as that of a wise and benevolent ruler, ready to hear the plight of [Root.GetHerHis] subjects and administer justice with a firm but gentle hand.\n[Root.GetHerHisCap] dedication to equity and virtue have undoubtedly ensured [Root.GetHerHim] a place by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s side and earned [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty a spot in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24071;It has come to my attention that several old laws issued by less forward-thinking rulers than I are still plaguing the judicial system of our realm, imposing undue limitations to my authority as [Root.GetTitle]. How am I supposed to accomplish anything worthy of note when I am bound by the leftovers of a time long since forgotten?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24072;Ever since I started my legal reform, I have had an increasing series of people, petty noblemen and peasants alike, pestering me about the changes I am making to our laws. They claim that the reform is motivated by selfish motives, that I only wish to accumulate power and tyrannize over my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24105;Only a few hours after [From.GetHerHis] unfortunate demise, [From.GetFirstName] has joined [From.GetHerHis] traitorous peers in the main hall, fashionably dressed and propped on the long, dusty table, the vacuous gaze of [From.GetHerHis] corpse staring at the empty plates before [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24106;It appears that my jailer has a particularly terrible fate in store for me. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] will have my body embalmed after my death and prop it in [From.GetHerHis] own palace like a macabre puppet to scare off [FromFrom.GetHerHis] enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24107;A few well-placed words, mixed with a bit of bribery and coercion are surely all that is needed to obfuscate the validity of some of the vile rumors that my enemies are spreading about me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24108;Keeping together this intricate web of lies holding my good reputation is proving to be an increasingly difficult task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24109;Sometimes I wonder whether my courtiers really believe in the lies I tell them, if I really am as blameless to their eyes as I hope to be, or if instead I am surrounded by smiling enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24110;Keeping all these lies together is quite the challenging task. All this exercise has sharpened my tongue beyond what I thought to be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24111;People are so gullible! They are all but pawns under my control, for me to push and break as I see fit, incapable of seeing the wolf in sheep's clothing as [Root.GetSheHe] walks amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24112;I cannot do this anymore! No matter how many people I kill, nobody believes to my accusers. Is the world gone insane?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24113;I have grown bored with [plot_target.GetFirstName]. I think the time has come for me to conclude our delightful game and move onto my next victim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24114;A mysterious stranger has joined me after tonight's feast. Although [From.GetHerHis] voice sounds familiar, I cannot remember if we have met before in the haze of the dinner. We exchange pleasantries for a while, until a strange feeling makes me shiver, and I suddenly realize that we are alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24115;The guest chuckles and welcomes me in a forceful embrace. Something stings me. When I push my assailant away, a stream of blood squirts from my side. The murderer tilts [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] head, smiles, and slashes my throat open with a quick cut of [From.GetHerHis] knife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24116;I isolate [From.GetFirstName] after a dinner feast. I stalk behind my target as [From.GetSheHe] stumbles through the corridors of the palace in a drunken stupor, and catch [From.GetHerHim] in a cold embrace, plunging my blade through [From.GetHerHis] side. As [From.GetSheHe] turns to scream for help, I cut [From.GetHerHis] throat open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24118;The guest chuckles and welcomes me in a forceful embrace. Something stings me and I instinctively push [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHim] away, seeing a stream of blood wetting my clothes already. Looking at my assailant's smile, I finally recognize [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHim] as [assassin_plot_owner.GetTitledFirstName] and scream [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24119;I isolate [From.GetFirstName] after a dinner feast. I stalk behind my target as [From.GetSheHe] stumbles through the corridors of the palace in a drunken stupor, and catch [From.GetHerHim] in a cold embrace, plunging my blade through [From.GetHerHis] side. Unfortunately, the [From.GetManWoman] recognizes me and screams my name before I can finish [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24121;My sudden moment of panic passes as quickly as it arrived when one of my courtiers call me from the other side of the corridor. I turn back to invite the strange guest to join us in the hall once again, but [assassin_plot_owner.GetSheHe] has vanished without leaving a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24122;Just as I thought I had finally isolated [From.GetFirstName] to perform my art in peace, one of [From.GetHerHis] drunken friends stumbles upon us in the corridors of [Root.Capital.GetName], forcing me to change my plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24124;As the guest approaches me with a few comforting words, I notice the dagger [assassin_plot_owner.GetSheHe] is hiding behind [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] back and immediately push [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHim] away, screaming for my guards. Seeing [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] attempt at murder fail, my assailant flees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24125;Just as I am about to start my art on [From.GetFirstName], the drunken fool manages to spot my dagger and starts screaming for help. In [From.GetHerHis] desperate counterattack, [From.GetFirstName] manages to wound me, forcing me to abandon my pursuit and flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24127;As the guest approaches me with a few comforting words, I notice the dagger [assassin_plot_owner.GetSheHe] is hiding behind [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] back and immediately push [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHim] on the ground, twisting the blade against [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHim] and plunging it into [assassin_plot_owner.GetHerHis] chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24128;Just as I am about to plunge my dagger through [From.GetHerHis] flesh, [From.GetFirstName] realizes the danger [From.GetSheHe] has gotten [From.GetHerselfHimself] into and reacts with surprising quickness and strength. [From.GetSheHeCap] slams me on the floor and twists my own blade against me, piercing my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24130;A wandering knight has arrived to my court, drawn in by the tales of virtue and bravery surrounding my family name. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] claims to have traveled far and wide, searching for a liege worth following, and that [invited_character.GetSheHe] wishes to pledge [invited_character.GetHerselfHimself] to my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24131;A wandering bard has arrived at my court, drawn in by the great tales of valor and honor surrounding my family name. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] claims that [invited_character.GetSheHe] wishes to pledge [invited_character.GetHerHis] loyalty to me and sing about the great deeds of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24133;I have received a distraught message from a damsel in need. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is suffering under the yoke of an uncouth [From.Liege.GetManWoman] with no honor. Hearing tales of my family's reputation, [From.GetSheHe] pleads me to offer [From.GetHerHim] my protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24231;Tales of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s cruelty have spread far and wide across the lands of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], reaching greater and greater height at each new year.The monstrous tyrant of [Root.Capital.GetName] has burned scores of innocent people to satisfy [Root.GetHerHis] whims. \nBelieving [Root.GetHerselfHimself] to be more than a mere mortal, [Root.GetFirstName] proudly flaunts [Root.GetHerHis] disregard for human life, convinced to be far beyond the reach of [Root.GetHerHis] petty subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24234;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] has always known how to properly deal with those that stand in the way of our glorious destiny. [From.GetFirstName]'s charred corpse is nothing but the last example of our power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24235;"You have angered the dragon," proclaims the jailer, dragging me out of my cell with a mocking smirk. "And now you will taste [FromFrom.GetHerHis] flames.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24237;A famous bard named [invited_character.GetFirstName] has arrived to my court, lured by tales of my family's generosity towards all artists and craftsmen. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] hopes to join my court and offer [invited_character.GetHerHis] services to such an illustrious patron of the art as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF24238;A renowned scholar has arrived to my court to request an audience with me. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] says [invited_character.GetSheHe] has heard tales of how my dynasty has always offered safe haven and patronage to scholars and artists, and that [invited_character.GetSheHe] wishes to pledge [invited_character.GetHerHis] vast metaphysical knowledge to my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF24002;As I hear the delightful melody coming from my brazen bull as the screams of [From.GetTitledFirstName] are filtered through the contraption, I find myself reflecting upon how much I have come to rely on this wonderful instrument, and on how much I resemble the enlightened King of Sicily who employed it the first time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24011;My recent victory over the Roman armies of [defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has resonated across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Despite all odds, I was able to lead my people against all the legions and the formidable power of the Imperial fleet, laying waste upon the decadent rule of House [defeated_emperor.GetOnlyDynastyName]. \nSuch was my triumph that the people have started to compare me to Teuta, an ancient [pagan_group.GetName] Queen who once stood against the ambitions of Rome, going even as far as to whisper that my prowess in this war is proof that I share some of my blood with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24012;As if the humiliation for our recent defeat at the hands of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not a price steep enough to pay for the Empire, more barbarians are gathering around the banner of our enemy, emboldened by the recent success of their brethren. Their leader has started to spread ludicrous rumors about her ancestral ties to Queen Teuta, another rebellious Queen of Illyria of bygone times. \nWe must clean the stain of this failure from our reputation before it is too late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24027;Yet another victim has fallen to my murderous whims. As I look down at the corpse on the floor, I realize that I have managed to stack quite a considerable body count by now. Soon enough, one of my guards brings me back to the matters at hand, asking me what should be done with the remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24033;After my most recent victory, I have reunited my most trusted commanders to discuss our future military campaigns. Through my skill and dedication, I have earned the loyalty of my armies and immortalized my name as one of the great conquerors of our time, one who emerged triumphant from countless battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24039;Through my considered and cautious leadership, I have been able to maintain my realm at peace, both from external and internal threats, ensuring security and prosperity for all my subjects. Few rulers can claim the same dedication as I have shown, forsaking the lure of conquest to protect their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24059;My dynasty has a large and proud history, yet I am sure by looking through the realm's records I will be able to find even more prestigious ancestors to adorn my family tree and increase my prestige and legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24060;Researching prestigious ancestors has helped me considerably to polish the reputation of my family, yet it is not enough. For our name to be remembered, we must endeavor to maintain a higher standard of behavior and class even today, despite our large numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24061;Thanks to the restless efforts of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has risen to fame amongst their peers as paragons of nobility and class.\n[Root.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.GetHerselfHimself] has become a symbol of parental responsibility and familial duty. A sophisticated [Root.GetManWoman] who has devoted [Root.GetHerHis] entire life to uphold the honor and virtue of [Root.GetHerHis] family's good name, [Root.GetSheHe] has become an example for all esteemed aristocrats to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24062;In order to make [Root.Capital.GetName] a center of theological discussion, I must invest some resources to find notable scholars, acquire treaties of past theologians and build the infrastructure needed to host both. It will not be an easy or cheap endeavor, to be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24063;Since I have started recruiting scholars and expanding the religious significance of my court, there has been a growing concern from the more conservative elements of the realm's clergy about the possibility that my research might undermine pre-existing religious practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24064;A beacon of virtue and wisdom, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has acquired immortal fame by dedicating years of [Root.GetHerHis] rule to reach a deeper understanding of the word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and of the truths hidden within our holy texts.\nRiding through an initial tide of controversy, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was able to establish a court of scholars and theologian, filled with endless disquisitions over the highest matters which will surely prove instrumental to lead us to gain a better understanding of this world and the ones beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24065;In order to attract artists and philosophers to [Root.Capital.GetName] I need to offer patronage and protection, as well as make sure that my court is an open space for free thinkers, one where they are able to express themselves and research new concepts without risk of punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24066;Now that artists are finally starting to populate [Root.Capital.GetName] in great numbers, it is time for me to fund their activities and provide the books and materials they need to operate their craft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24067;Having spent years of [Root.GetHerHis] reign sponsoring artists and philosophers within [Root.GetHerHis] realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has become famous as an enlightened patron of the arts, celebrated in poems, paintings and ballads all throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.\nKnown as a learned and charming personality, the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has become the archetype of the philosopher [Root.GetKingQueen] of [Root.GetHerHis] age, a protector of all that is beautiful and metaphysical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24068;My path to eternal fame is clear. By cleansing my realm of all the impure, heretical influences that plague it and consecrate it to the glory of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24070;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has become notorious for [Root.GetHerHis] staunch approach towards religion all throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. At the head of an endless host of inquisitors and overseers, [Root.GetSheHe] has slowly replaced all the most peaceful members of the clergy within [Root.GetHerHis] realm with uncompromising fanatics. With their help, [Root.GetSheHe] has taken upon [Root.GetHerselfHimself] the holy task of cleansing all heretical inclinations from [Root.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24073;In [Root.GetHerHis] greedy lust for power, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has turned many of [Root.GetHerHis] past followers away while losing [Root.GetHerselfHimself] into spiral of selfishness and tyranny.\nHaving lost any care [Root.GetSheHe] might have had for [Root.GetHerHis] subjects, [Root.GetSheHe] has focused [Root.GetHerHis] entire attention in accumulating more powers under [Root.GetHerHis] title and celebrating [Root.GetHerHis] alleged accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24100;[Root.Educator.GetFirstName] is such a bore! [Root.Educator.GetHerHisCap] lessons are tedious and [Root.Educator.GetSheHe] never lets me play in peace. I think it is time for me to find a better guardian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24101;[From.GetFirstName] was really insistent about showing me a present [From.GetSheHe] prepared just for me, yet, now that we are alone in [From.GetHerHis] chambers, I do not think following [From.GetHerHim] was such a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24102;It seems I underestimated [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] did not fall for my trick and simply scolded me for trying to get [From.GetHerHim] hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24103;A bit of careful waiting, a few stings in the right places, and, just like that, the game is already over. Well, for [From.GetFirstName], that is. How unfortunate that [From.GetSheHe] will no longer be able to fulfill [From.GetHerHis] duties as my guardian anymore. Perhaps [From.GetHerHis] successor will be kinder to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24104;It has been some time since anybody at court saw [Root.Educator.GetTitledFirstName]. The [Root.Educator.GetManWoman] seems to have vanished without leaving a trace. [FromFrom.GetFirstName], [Root.Educator.GetFirstName]'s ward, has been pestering me for quite some time about assigning [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to a new guardian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24134;Only through constant practice and innovation can a commander maintain dominance over the battlefield. I must drill my troops regularly if I wish to prevail against my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24135;All these days spent in the field, shouting orders and hitting things have done wonders to improve my reflexes and endurance, yet they have not been good for my looks. The coarse voice, messy hair and foul stench are making me look more and more like a man than I would like to admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24136;Organizing formations with uneducated peasants and unexperienced officers looks like an impossible task at times. How many times can I repeat a very simple strategy before it finally enters the thick mind of my soldiers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24137;All of this studying, training and discussing strategy has given me very little time to rest or eat. I feel that, if I am not too careful, I might soon become too weak to hold a sword or yell my orders at the troops. I have already taken on a more skeletal look and I am becoming increasingly paler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24138;Only by improving the relations I have with my fellow noblemen I can ensure peace and prosperity for my people. And there is no better way to do so than by exchanging gifts and organizing a few lavish feasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24139;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dedicated a lot of [From.GetHerHis] time in the past weeks trying to make sure that all [From.GetHerHis] vassals understand the girth of [From.GetHerHis] prestige and generosity, holding several feasts and getting to know each of us better. [From.GetSheHeCap] has undoubtedly proven to be an enthralling [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24140;I hope you will accept this small gift in exchange for your hospitality and care, my [Root.GetTitle].\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24141;Being such a popular public figure is proving to be more vexing than I ever thought possible. The expectations my guests have about me are quite high, and they appear very often to be focused on my appearance more than anything else. Most of the times, they will not even care of what comes out of my mouth, enthralled as they are by my voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24142;All these meetings and feasts I organize to keep my subjects and neighbors happy have come with no shortages of toasts to new friendships and a prosperous future. It is always quite inspiring, yet I am not sure how much dignified it is to reach the end of every night as a giggling goose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24143;All these visits, feasts and celebrations are giving me endless new opportunities to further refine my palate with all sorts of exotic foods, and I fear that if I do not watch myself, the graceful figure I was blessed with will soon be a long-lost memory, as the paunch tightly pressing my dress can already attest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24144;All my informers are ready to relay my orders throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], using bribery and intimidation to prevent my subjects from conspiring against me and putting the realm's peace under threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24145;The vile spies sworn to the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty have been unleashed once more upon [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Recent rumors have convinced the [From.GetTitle] that somebody might be conspiring against [From.GetHerHim] and, as has become tradition for some time now, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] cronies to pressure all of [From.GetHerHis] subjects into submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24149;Peace is not easily ensured upon the unruly masses. Even now, my vassals keep conspiring within the inscrutable depths of their thoughts, where my spies cannot reach them. If I wish to find proof to frame them, I must be vigilant. Every cowardly twitch and bashful gaze around me betrays their treasonous hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24150;More naive rulers might claim that stability and prosperity in government is achieved through an open relation of mutual trust between a liege and [Root.GetHerHis] vassals, yet nothing could be further from the truth. To give my subjects any reprieve from scrutiny would only invite insubordination and chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24151;It is my sworn duty to uphold the peace over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. In order to do so, I must crush any form of organized resistance coming from my rebellious subjects. Hardening my heart against their entitled demands is something that I do for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24152;I worry about [meddling_target.GetFirstName]. If [meddling_target.GetSheHe] is going to represent the prestigious [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] name, [meddling_target.GetHerHis] bearing and behavior should be impeccable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24155;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] decided to visit me last night. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been concerned with my health as of late, and wanted to remind me that [From.GetSheHe] is always going to be ready to support me, and so is the rest of our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24156;I have just received a long, stern chiding from my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] about my current conduct. [From.GetSheHeCap] has berated me for surrendering to vice and apathy in such a way as to bring dishonor to our prestigious family name, and urged me to change my attitude immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24157;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to give me a long talk about the virtues and responsibilities of a good [Root.GetManWoman] towards [Root.GetHerHis] family, about the necessity to remain faithful to one's spouse, build a relationship based on trust and respect, and, most importantly, maintain the bloodline going with new heirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24158;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been pressuring me for quite some time now to fall in line with the [scoped_founder.Culture.GetName] customs upon which our great dynasty has been founded. According to [From.GetHerHim], only by embracing this culture I will be able to set good morals for my descendants to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24159;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] believes that I spend too much time worrying about my looks and not enough studying and tending to my responsibilities as a [Root.GetTitle], that I am wasting my youth as a vacuous fop and I will come to regret it in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24160;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] believes that I do not spend enough time taking care of my image, that it is extremely important for a young [Root.GetManWoman] of my stature to always appear at my best before my subjects. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that by neglecting myself I smear my family's good name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24161;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been encouraging me for some time now to try and eat more, fearing that my frugal diet might cause me to get seriously sick, and that my frail disposition might reflect badly on our family's prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24162;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been encouraging me for some time now to try and eat less, fearing that immoderation in my diet might cause me to get seriously sick and, more importantly, that it might put a stain on our family's good name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24163;My [GetFromRelation] has heeded my call and finally embraced [From.Culture.GetName] customs. I am certain that [From.GetHerHis] new attitude will lead [From.GetHerHim] to treat [From.GetHerHis] subjects with decency and justice, and allow [From.GetHerHim] to teach good morals to [From.GetHerHis] children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24164;My [GetFromRelation] has stubbornly refused to listen to my advice. [From.GetFirstName] insists that [From.GetSheHe] was born and grown [From.Culture.GetName] and will not abandon the proud and moral traditions of [From.GetHerHis] culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24165;My [GetFromRelation] has taken to heart my advice and sacrificed some of the time [From.GetSheHe] wasted at the altar of vanity to focus on [From.GetHerHis] responsibilities instead. [From.GetFirstName] might not be quite as much the charmer with the ladies at court as [From.GetSheHe] used to be, but it is for [From.GetHerHis] own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24166;My [GetFromRelation] refused to follow my advice and is still spending an undue amount of time grooming [From.GetHerselfHimself] while neglecting some of [From.GetHerHis] responsibilities. I fear that [From.GetSheHe] is too enamored with [From.GetHerHis] own image to see how [From.GetHerHis] behavior is hampering is growth as a [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24167;Following my advice, my [GetFromRelation] has finally started to take better care of [From.GetHerselfHimself] and is slowly learning how to properly act at court. Even I was surprised to see how much more charming [From.GetSheHe] could become just by cleaning [From.GetHerHis] face and speaking more softly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24168;[From.GetFirstName] refuses to listen to reason. My [GetFromRelation] seems to prefer acting like a wild animal, loud and uncivilized, too absorbed by [From.GetHerHis] own petty interests to understand how [From.GetHerHis] crass demeanor is costing [From.GetHerHim] the respect of [From.GetHerHis] peers and the dignity of [From.GetHerHis] family name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24169;I am glad to see my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and started to eat more. A young, healthy [From.GetManWoman] of [From.GetHerHis] status should work on developing a robust and imposing figure, worthy of fear and respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24170;Yet again, I meet my [GetFromRelation]'s gaze with scornful disdain across the dinner table, seeing [From.GetHerHim] refuse to finish [From.GetHerHis] first course. [From.GetFirstName] has completely ignored my advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24171;My [GetFromRelation] has decided to follow my advice and finally change [From.GetHerHis] dieting practices. [From.GetFirstName] looks much more lean and spry already, as a [From.GetManWoman] of [From.GetHerHis] age should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24172;Yet again, I meet my [GetFromRelation]'s gaze with scornful disdain across the dinner table, seeing [From.GetHerHim] demand another course for [From.GetHerselfHimself]. [From.GetFirstName] has completely ignored my advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24173;I am thoroughly impressed by how seriously my [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice to be an exemplar spouse. [From.GetFirstName] has acquired a reputation for courtly manners and undying loyalty of the kind that only bards sing about when referring to Princes in fairy tales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24200;Legends about Alexander the Great and his epic campaign across Asia are told throughout the known world. Countless young rulers have wasted their lives in their hopeless attempts to emulate the immortal achievements of this legendary figure.\nHaving died young, after fathering only one child, Alexander was unable to establish an imperial dynasty, despite his many accomplishments, tragically dooming his Empire to fall shortly after its creation.\nRulers of all creeds and nations claim to trace their ancestors to the fleeting line of Alexander, yet none have been able to have such a prestigious claim be recognized by their peers and subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24201;The location of the hallowed grounds where the great conqueror was put to his final rest has been a contested topic for millennia. Many Roman Emperors of old have claimed to have visited the tomb of Alexander during their rise to power, yet its true location still eludes modern scholars.\nThe recovery of my ancestor's sacred remains would surely strengthen my claim to his bloodline. As [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I am closer than most contenders to the most likely locations, yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24202;No sooner Alexander had passed on that his generals had already started fighting for possession over his body. They knew that the one amongst them who became guardian of his remains would be acclaimed as his true successor.\nAnd in the same way, I am certain that by ensuring the recovery of Alexander's body my claim to his ancestry will be stronger than any upstart [Root.Culture.GetName] ruler. Having already spent several weeks consulting the most learned scholars in the realm to gather more information regarding the tomb's possible locations, it is now time for me to invest in a proper expedition to uncover the ancient sepulcher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24203;Historians agree that Alexander had a son, named after him, born of a Bactrian Princess, yet the life of this child is shrouded by mystery. The Empire he was supposed to inherit from his father had long been split amongst greedy warlords by the time Alexander's son became a man, making it impossible for him to succeed.\nFearing retaliation from the Diadochi, it is no surprise that Alexander's wife would flee from his army and hide the child from assassination attempts.\nIt is not so far-fetched to think that their descendants found refuge to [Root.Capital.GetName] eventually, and split into the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].\nMy scholars only need to find the right references in the ancient accounts of my dynasty to uncover this prestigious link.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24204;The valiant members of my expedition have finally returned to [Root.Capital.GetName].\nThey bring a marvelous gift with them: a mummified corpse, covered in ancient jewels that they claim to belong to my distinguished ancestor.\nAfter a long consultation with my scholars, who carefully examine every detail of the body, I am certain that the expedition has been successful.\nAfter having been lost for so many centuries, the body of Alexander the Great has finally been found, and I am the one responsible for its recovery. The only thing that remains for my claim to Alexander's ancestry to become unobjectionable, is to make this news known throughout the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24205;The valiant members of my expedition have finally returned to [Root.Capital.GetName].\nUnfortunately, they do not bring much with them. A few rusted jewels and fragments of a skulls, which my scholars quickly dismiss as too recent to belong to the great conqueror.\nDespite the alleged care and efforts that they put into their search, my men were unable to succeed, wasting a considerable amount of my time and resources for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24206;It took us countless sleepless nights spent reading ancient tomes and pursuing forgotten scrolls, but we have finally achieved our goal. Under my lead, my group of scholars has been able to trace a lineage from the earliest known members of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and the most plausible line of descendants of the glorious conqueror himself.\nThe only thing that is left now is to validate my claim in the eyes of my peers and subjects.\nMany envious upstarts are sure likely to dismiss my findings, jealous of my illustrious ascendancy. I will need to make sure that their voices are drowned out in the celebration for this momentous discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24207;Despite all the sleepless nights, hundreds of researched scrolls and learned scholars, my efforts to find a link between my dynasty and Alexander's unknown descendants has been fruitless.\nSurely, a man that has traveled so far and wide, that has achieved so much during his brief life and earned eternal glory would not allow his glorious line to die out.\nAnd a dynasty as powerful as mine, who has risen to hold the most esteemed throne of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must surely trace its ancestry to the great conqueror himself.\nWhy is it then so hard for me to find the link between us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24208;After years of study, research and investment, I have finally achieved my goal and eternally bound my dynasty's name to one of the greatest conquerors of known history.\nLong after I am gone, people will look at my descendants in awe and tremble at the very thought of meeting them on the field of battle.\nWithin our veins flows the same strength that subjugated Egypt, the same genius that cracked Babylon, the same ambition that led one man to travel from the heart of civilization to the edge of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24209;Despite my best efforts, my peers have yet to recognize the legitimacy of my claim to Alexander's ancestry.\nEven worse, my own subjects have reacted with apathy and skepticism to the news about my dynasty's prestigious founder. My councilors believe that the people are simply too ignorant to understand the importance of my discovery, while my peers are merely envious of its implications.\nFor one reason or the other, my quest is not over yet. My claim will have no value for as long as it is not universally recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24210;There have been many rumors about [From.GetTitledFirstName] recently.\nUsing the help of charlatans, sorcerers and grave-robbers, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has fabricated a ludicrous claim to Alexander's the Great dynasty. Many rulers have made such ludicrous assertions in the past, trying to latch onto the glorious name of the ancient conqueror, yet none had been taken seriously, until now.\nBy associating [From.GetHerHis] family to Alexander, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has succeeded in increasing enormously the prestige of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24220;Ashoka is remembered by many for his outstanding military victories and his wise and prosperous rule. Under his lead, all of India was unified and at peace.\nOf all the dynasties who hopelessly wasted their lives trying to emulate his accomplishments, mine was the closest to succeed. I have been pondering as of recently if the accomplishments of my family in reunifying India and holding it under a just and enlightened rule should be proof that the glorious spirit of Ashoka is being reincarnated through our bloodline, all the way to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24221;Being already responsible for the reunification of India, my family has a greater claim to Ashoka's legacy than any other [Root.Culture.GetName] ruler, yet, in order for me to be formally recognized as a reincarnation of the enlightened Devanampiya Piyadassi, I must submit myself to the judgment of the wisest amongst us.\nI will call for the oldest and most prestigious Brahmins in India and allow them to examine my life and judge my character, so that they can confirm to my peers and subjects what I already know is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24222;The wise Brahmins that have gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName] to examine and determine whether I am worthy of calling myself heir to Ashoka or not claim that, before anything else, I must prove my courage to them.\nDespite being born the youngest of Maurya Bindusara's sons and from a mere lowborn, he proved unparalleled bravery during the course of his life, surpassing all of his siblings to arise as a paragon of virtue and discipline.\nIf I truly am the new lion of India, it should be easy for me to prove that I have the fortitude to meet my bold claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24223;It has been months now, yet the Brahmins are unsatisfied with my conduct.\nThey claim that I have failed to meet the standards of Ashoka's divine valor, of his enlightened leadership in battle and strategic skills.\nIf I truly am is reincarnation, I should not dread the prospect of facing my enemies and my insecurities. \nUntil I have proven to them the purity of my intent, they will not allow me to proceed to the next phase of their test.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24224;Ashoka's father may have been an Emperor, but his mother was a common woman, the daughter of a poor Brahmin, and he was but the last of a large litter of Princes.\nAlthough in time he arose far above his station, outshining both his siblings and his old father, it is only thanks to his humble beginnings that Ashoka was able to rule with justice and kindness over the many people of India, achieving harmony between our various creeds and customs.\nIf I am Ashoka's new form, then I must remember the low beginnings of my previous life and share his humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24227;The Brahmins are not satisfied with my show of charity.\nThey claim that merely giving some gold to the less fortunate is not enough to prove the true purity of intent that Jaya showed when he met Buddha. When Ashoka's past form had almost nothing, he was still driven to share what little he had to a complete stranger.\nThey say that my display is vacuous at best in comparison as the gifts that I am giving to my subjects I will take back in time as their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24228;It was not an easy task to convince the Brahmins, but their final response was inevitable.\nIt was only a matter of time before my true nature was revealed for all the world to admire. \nI am the last incarnation of Ashoka, the great unifier of India.\nBy returning in the form of [Root.GetFullName] I have led the people of this great land to peace and prosperity just as I did in my past life, and just like my successors will do after I leave this body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24229;After a long, laborious ordeal, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been announced by a council of Brahmins as the new incarnation of Devanampiya Piyadassi.\nAfter having unified India once already in the form of Ashoka, this enlightened spirit has been reborn in the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and achieve this glorious feat a second time.\nUnder [From.GetHerHis] rule, India is sure to know peace, prosperity and harmony for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24230;My prestigious ancestor had already conquered the known world as a young man, bringing the Persian Empire to its knees and traveling all the way from Greece to India, and how much did I accomplish in the same time? How many great conquests have I achieved in my youth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24251;As the sword of Temporal power was entrusted to the Emperor of the Romans by the Holy See, so it can be withdrawn.\nBy besmirching the dignity of [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] sacred charge, [defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] brought upon [defeated_emperor.GetHerselfHimself] the just retribution of Our Lord. As the humble instrument of His divine wrath, I was able to lead my troops to victory against this heretic, and so thorough was [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] defeat that [defeated_emperor.GetSheHe] was forced to recognize me as Imperial Vicar of Italy, abandoning in all but name [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] claim over the peninsula.\n\nAs a reward for my devotion to the Church, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has offered to recognize in perpetuity the role of my dynasty as protector of the Holy See.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24252;[defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName]'s conflict against the Holy See has come to a humiliating conclusion, in no small part due to the interference of the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nThe armies of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have defeated the [defeated_emperor.GetTitle]'s forces time and again, forcing [defeated_emperor.GetHerHim] to sue for peace and recognize in clear terms [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] submission to the Church's authority, as well as relinquish [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] claim of direct dominion over Italy.\n\nWith this victory, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has likely reaffirmed the primacy of the Vatican over the Empire for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24253;Thanks to the stubbornness of the petty Lords of Italy, my conflict against the Holy See has come to a humiliating conclusion. \n\nThe armies of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have defeated my own forces time and again, forcing me not only to recognize the supremacy of the Church over the secular Throne, but to appoint [From.GetFirstName] Imperial Vicar of Italy, relinquishing my rightful claim over the peninsula in all but name.\n\nWith this victory, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has likely reaffirmed the power of the Vatican over the Empire for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF24002;After spending some time researching as well as discussing with a local blacksmith, I was able to submit [From.GetFirstName] to the most intriguing of tortures – a brazen bull. As the [From.GetManWoman] was cooked inside this wonderful contraption, [From.GetHerHis] screams were turned into a delightful and cautionary melody for all my court to hear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24011;My recent victory over the Roman armies of [defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has resonated across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Despite all odds, I was able to stand strong against all the legions and the formidable power of the Imperial fleet, laying waste upon the decadent rule of House [defeated_emperor.GetOnlyDynastyName]. \nSuch was my triumph that the people have started to compare me to Teuta, an ancient Queen who once stood against the ambitions of Rome, going even as far as to whisper that my prowess in this war is proof that I share some of my blood with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24012;The [defeated_emperor.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has recently suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Galvanized by their victory, the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have started idolizing their [From.GetTitle], comparing [From.GetHerHim] to a ruler of their legends and claiming [From.GetHerHim] to have such a heroic ascendancy.\n Through her victory, the pagan tribes of old Illyria have discovered a new strength to stand against their Roman masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24059;Might be small, but I am sure that if I look hard enough through the realm's records I will be able to find enough prestigious ancestors to adorn my family tree and increase my prestige and legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24060;Researching prestigious ancestors has helped me considerably to polish the reputation of my family, yet it is not enough. For our name to be remembered, we must endeavor to maintain a higher standard of behavior and class even today, especially given the small size of our dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24061;Thanks to the restless efforts of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has risen to fame amongst their peers as paragons of nobility and class despite its small size.\n[Root.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.GetHerselfHimself] has become a symbol of parental responsibility and familial duty. A sophisticated [Root.GetManWoman] who has devoted [Root.GetHerHis] entire life to uphold the honor and virtue of [Root.GetHerHis] family's good name, [Root.GetSheHe] has become an example for all esteemed aristocrats to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24069;Everywhere I turn I see a new abominable product of heresy. Licentious poems, grotesque paintings, works of fictions trivializing the tales of our holy texts and confusing the common folks of [Root.Capital.GetName]. I must put a stop to all this degeneracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24135;All these days spent in the field, shouting orders and hitting things have done wonders to improve my reflexes and endurance, yet they have not been good for my looks. The coarse voice, wavy nose, rough skin and foul stench are making me look more and more like a wild animal than I would like to admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24137;All of this studying, training and discussing strategy has given me very little time to rest or eat. I feel that, if I am not too careful, I might soon become too weak to wear armor or yell my orders at the troops. I have developed some distinct bags under my eyes and lost some hair already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24139;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dedicated a lot of [From.GetHerHis] time in the past weeks trying to make sure that all the neighbors of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] understand the girth of [From.GetHerHis] prestige and generosity, holding several feasts and attempting to know each of us better. [From.GetSheHeCap] has undoubtedly proven to be an enthralling [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24140;These gems scarcely match the beauty of your eyes, yet I still hope you will accept them from your humble servant.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24142;All these meetings and feasts I organize to keep my subjects and neighbors happy have come with no shortages of toasts to new friendships and a prosperous future. It is always quite inspiring, yet I am not sure how much dignified it is to reach the end of every night as a grunting half-wit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24143;All these visits, feasts and celebrations are giving me endless new opportunities to further refine my palate with all sorts of exotic foods, and I fear that if I do not watch myself, the fit body I was blessed with will soon be a long-lost memory, as my puffy jowls can already attest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24159;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] believes that I spend too much time worrying about my looks and that I will come to regret wasting my youth in such a vapid when my beauty has shriveled away and I am left with a wrinkled body and an empty head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24160;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] thinks that I am too loud and crass, that I spend too much time managing menial court affairs while forsaking my own grooming. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that a young [Root.GetLordLady] of my stature should always strive to look at [Root.GetHerHis] best, projecting an aura of grace and dignity by [Root.GetHerHis] very presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24161;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been encouraging me for some time now to try and eat more, insisting that I need to be sturdier if I wish to deliver strong children, and that my frail disposition might reflect badly on our family's prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24162;For some time now my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been making comments insinuating that I might be gaining too much weight, and that I should exert more moderation, especially during court dinners, as it is unfit for a [Root.GetLordLady] of my stature to be seen eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24165;My [GetFromRelation] has taken to heart my advice and sacrificed some of the time [From.GetSheHe] wasted at the altar of vanity to focus on [From.GetHerHis] responsibilities instead. [From.GetFirstName] might not be quite as much popular with the young lords and bards at the court as [From.GetSheHe] used to be, but it is for [From.GetHerHis] own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24167;Following my advice, my [GetFromRelation] has finally started to take better care of [From.GetHerselfHimself] and is slowly learning how to properly act at court. [From.GetFirstName] looks more and more like a proper [From.GetLordLady] with each passing day. Bards might soon start writing songs about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24169;I am glad to see my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and started to eat more. A young, healthy [From.GetManWoman] of [From.GetHerHis] status should work on developing a robust frame and birthing hips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24171;My [GetFromRelation] has decided to follow my advice and finally change [From.GetHerHis] dieting practices. [From.GetFirstName] looks much more graceful and delicate already, as a [From.GetManWoman] of [From.GetHerHis] age should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24173;I am thoroughly impressed by how seriously my [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice to be an exemplar spouse. [From.GetFirstName] has acquired a reputation for unblemished fealty and staunch chastity of the kind that only bards sing about when referring to Princesses in fairy tales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24201;The location of the hallowed grounds where the great conqueror was put to his final rest has been a contested topic for millennia. Many Roman Emperors of old have claimed to have visited the tomb of Alexander during their rise to power, yet its true location still eludes modern scholars.\nThe recovery of my ancestor's sacred remains would surely strengthen my claim to his bloodline. Yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action, especially given how far my expedition would have to travel to reach the most likely locations of the tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24220;Ashoka is remembered by many for his outstanding military victories and his wise and prosperous rule. Under his lead, all of India was unified and at peace.\nMany rulers have wasted their lives hopelessly trying to emulate his accomplishments. As the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I have certainly come closer than most, and I wonder now if the feats of my family are proof enough that the glorious spirit of Ashoka is being reincarnated through our bloodline, all the way to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24221;As a celebrated [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I have already a greater claim to Ashoka's legacy than many other [Root.Culture.GetName] rulers, yet, in order for me to be formally recognized as a reincarnation of the enlightened Devanampiya Piyadassi, I must submit myself to the judgment of the wisest amongst us.\nI will call for the oldest and most prestigious Brahmins in India and allow them to examine my life and judge my character, so that they can confirm to my peers and subjects what I already know is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24225;Despite my many attempts to convince them otherwise, the Brahmins are not satisfied by my display of humility. They claim that my demeanor betrays the inner smugness of somebody born within the highest echelons of nobility, somebody that has no knowledge nor memory of hunger and anonymity.\nA few of them are convinced that my very desire to be recognized as the heir to Ashoka is proof enough of my unbridled pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24226;According to legend, Siddhartha Gautama was the first to predict the coming of Ashoka. The Gift of Dust, the story holding his prophecy, tells of a time when Ashoka, born as Jaya in one of his previous lives, saw Buddha wandering the streets of his village while playing in the mud. The child, taken by his desire to offer something to the wanderer, threw a fistful of dirt in the Tathagata's bowl.\nBuddha, moved by his gesture, predicted that Jaya would be reborn as Ashoka, Emperor of all India.\nThe Brahmins state that, in order to be acknowledged as Ashoka's new form, I will need to prove that I am just as charitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24228;It was not an easy task to convince the Brahmins, but their final response was inevitable.\nIt was only a matter of time before my true nature was revealed for all the world to admire. \nI am the last incarnation of Ashoka, the great unifier of India.\nBy returning in the form of [Root.GetFullName] I will unify the people of this great land under a new Empire of Harmony and Virtue, just like I did in my past life and just like my successors will continue to do after I leave this body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24229;After a long, laborious ordeal, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been announced by a council of Brahmins as the new incarnation of Devanampiya Piyadassi.\nAfter having unified India once already in the form of Ashoka, this enlightened spirit has been reborn in the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [From.GetSheHe] is now set to achieve this glorious feat for the second time.\nUnder [From.GetHerHis] rule, India is sure to know peace, prosperity and harmony for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24230;My prestigious ancestor had already conquered the known world as a young man, unifying all of the different people of India under one rule, and how much did I accomplish in the same time? How many great conquests have I achieved in my youth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24251;As the sword of Temporal power was entrusted to the Emperor of the Romans by the Holy See, so it can be withdrawn.\nBy besmirching the dignity of [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] sacred charge, [defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] brought upon [defeated_emperor.GetHerselfHimself] the just retribution of Our Lord. As the humble instrument of His divine wrath, I was able to lead my troops to victory against this heretic, putting an end to [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] blasphemy.\n\nAs a reward for my devotion to the Church, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has offered to recognize in perpetuity the role of my dynasty as protector of the Holy See.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24252;[defeated_emperor.GetTitledFirstName]'s conflict against the Holy See has come to a humiliating conclusion, in no small part due to the interference of the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nThe armies of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have defeated the [defeated_emperor.GetTitle]'s forces time and again, forcing [defeated_emperor.GetHerHim] to sue for peace and recognize in clear terms [defeated_emperor.GetHerHis] submission to the Church's authority.\n\nWith this victory, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has likely reaffirmed the primacy of the Vatican over the Empire for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF24253;My conflict against the Holy See has come to a humiliating conclusion, in no small part due to the interference of the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. \n\nThe armies of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have defeated my own forces time and again, forcing me to sue for peace and recognize in clear terms my submission to the Church's authority.\n\nWith this victory, [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] has likely reaffirmed the primacy of the Vatican over the Empire for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF24140;I will never forget the warm welcome you gave me, my [Root.GetTitle]. I hope you will accept this token in return.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF24165;[From.GetFirstName] and I have never been as close as since I convinced my [GetFromRelation] to forsake empty vanity to focus on more concrete responsibilities. The rest of the court might see us as coarse and uncivilized, but we both know better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF24167;By following my advice, [From.GetFirstName] has become quite the charmer. Maidens that would not have given [From.GetHerHim] a second look before are now filling the palace with their feverish gossiping about my [GetFromRelation]. I have never felt as proud of [From.GetHerHim] before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF24169;Feeling [From.GetFirstName] encroaching on my place at the dinner table, I stick my elbow in [From.GetHerHis] gut, prompting my [GetFromRelation] to raise [From.GetHerHis] head from the plate. [From.GetSheHeCap] proclaims that there soon will not be enough space for both of us in the hall, at which point we both erupt in a bellowing laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF24171;Ever since [From.GetFirstName] decided to follow my advice, we have spent much more time together, eschewing the crass excesses of evening dinners for relaxing walks outside and quiet contemplation. My [GetFromRelation] has never looked better, having acquired a much more humble and collected figure, not unlike my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF24173;I am thoroughly impressed by well my talk with my [GetFromRelation] went. [From.GetFirstName] now fully understands the mutual bounds and responsibilities that bind us together, both in marriage and blood, and has taken on a completely new and inspiring attitude when it comes to upholding the sanctity of our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF24140;I wish you to take this small trinket, along with all my gratitude for the excellent time we spent together during the last feast.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF24167;By following my advice, [From.GetFirstName] has become quite the charmer. Young men that would not have given [From.GetHerHim] a second look before are now hopelessly competing for [From.GetHerHis] favor and attention, following my [GetFromRelation] whenever [From.GetSheHe] goes. I have never felt as proud of [From.GetHerHim] before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF24169;[From.GetFirstName] rests back [From.GetHerHis] head with a sleepy expression, pressing a napkin on [From.GetHerHis] mouth to suppress a belch. I point at the paunch pressing against [From.GetHerHis] dress and comment that, with such commitment to [From.GetHerHis] new diet, my [GetFromRelation] will soon outrank me as the largest member of our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF24171;Ever since [From.GetFirstName] decided to follow my advice, we have spent much more time together, eschewing the crass excesses of evening dinners for relaxing walks outside and quiet contemplation.

EVTDESCHFA24014;Dozens of ships have gathered at the shores of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] from the most disparate owners – pirates, adventurers, mercenaries, fishermen...

EVTDESCHFA24015;A few dozen ships have gathered at the shores of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] from the most disparate owners – pirates, adventurers, mercenaries, fishermen...

EVTDESCHFA24026;When [Root.GetTitledFirstName] ascended to the throne at such an early age, few in [Root.GetHerHis] court expected [Root.GetHerHim] to last to adulthood.\nYet, in the end, it was [Root.GetHerHis] detractors that did not survive through the [Root.GetTitle]'s childhood.\nUnder [Root.GetHerHis] cheerful and playful appearance, the child demonstrated an unparalleled ruthlessness in [Root.GetHerHis] rise to power, meticulously eliminating all those that opposed [Root.GetHerHim]. \nDespite having long since shed the illusory semblance of innocence that allowed [Root.GetHerHim] to lure many of [Root.GetHerHis] victims to an untimely end, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has become infamous throughout the realm for [Root.GetHerHis] sanguinary childhood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA24239;A mysterious [invited_character.GetManWoman] has reached my court. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] claims to be a renown scholar from a place far away, who was cast out by [invited_character.GetHerHis] people for [invited_character.GetHerHis] unyielding devotion to knowledge. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] hopes that a prestigious patron of the arts such as myself would have greater foresight than [invited_character.GetHerHis] previous liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA24240;Thanks to the tireless efforts of the glorious [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the lands of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have been wrestled from the barbarity and the misery of its dark past, and have been dragged into a new era of clarity and order. \nA new urbanized bureaucratic caste has taken hold of the provinces once held by quarreling warlords, reinvigorating the Imperial Throne with legitimacy and power beyond all expectations.\n\nTen thousand years of peace and prosperity upon the great [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and its magnificent reformer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF24059;I can ask to my immediate relatives about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24060;We must all do our part to immortalize our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24062;A few notable scholars will be enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24063;I will divert some resources to reassure the opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24065;I should make known that artists are welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24066;A large workshop should provide them with what they need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF24068;I will find sympathetic voices amongst the priesthood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF24072;No matter, these dissenters will soon disappear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24073;The most magnificent [Root.GetTitle] of this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24100;Do you want to play a very special game, [Root.Educator.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24101;Careful, child, you might get hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24102;Ugh... Stupid grownup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24103;Such a tragically fortuitous accident...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24104;I wonder if..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24105;What a charming new guest we have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24106;What!?! That is insane!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24107;I would never raise a hand against my kin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24108;So many things to remember...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24109;What are they thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24110;There is always room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24111;How delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24112;I must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24113;Let us end this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24114;Where is everybody?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24115;Glrgh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24116;Shhh, sleep well, dear child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24118;Help! [assassin_plot_owner.GetFirstName] kills me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24119;What a spoilsport.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24121;How peculiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24122;I just like that, the mood is ruined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24124;Next time, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24127;[assassin_plot_owner.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24128;How-?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24130;I will give you command of an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24131;You are welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24133;My heart melts at your plea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24134;We will focus on fighting on foreign territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24135;I am too important to look like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24136;Losing myself to anger will only cloud my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24137;I can always find some time for eating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24138;I should invite my neighbors to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24139;Clearly [From.GetSheHe] must have ulterior motives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24141;If only I could avoid all of this attention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24142;I should try to be more composed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24143;I should be more careful of what I eat in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24144;Peace must be achieved by all means necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24145;When will it be over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24146;Spies are everywhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24147;It looks worse than usual, too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24148;Has it been a year already?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24149;Yet, I should not let fear cloud my judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24150;All that said, I should show them some compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24151;I am nothing if not just.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24152;I have a few words about [meddling_target.GetHerHis] habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24153;I need to help [meddling_target.GetHerHim] take care of [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24154;[meddling_target.GetSheHeCap] should focus more on [meddling_target.GetHerHis] responsibilities and less on [meddling_target.GetHerHis] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24155;Thank you, I really needed that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24156;Oh, alright, alright!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24157;I will try to do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24158;It does sound reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24159;I will heed your words, dear [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24160;Whatever you say, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24161;If you say so, [GetFromRelation]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24163_A;Now we truly look like [GetFromRelation] and [From.GetRootRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24163_B;It is [From.GetHerHis] duty as a [From.GetOnlyDynastyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24164;How else can I make [From.GetHerHim] understand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24165_A;A sharp mind trumps a pretty face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24165_B;Perhaps I was too harsh with [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24167_A;You are finally starting to look like a proper [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24167_B;I hope [From.GetSheHe] does not go too far now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24173_A;We truly are of one mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24173_B;I could not ask for a more virtuous [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24200;I will be the first to succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24201;Finding Alexander's remains is imperative!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24202;I shall spare no expenses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24203;I will provide you with everything you need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24204;Send out every messenger, inform every crier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24205;We must try again! That tomb must be somewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24207;Maybe I should focus my attention on Alexander's tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24208;Eternal glory awaits us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24209;We need more celebrations and exposure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24210;How can people fall for such a blatant fabrication?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24220;We must get to the root of this question!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24221;We will take all precautions when hosting the wise ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24222;Allow me to enlighten you with tales of my valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24223;If only you could tell me more precisely what you expect of me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24224;If I were proud, would I submit myself to your judgment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24225;Is your test not faulty to begin with then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24226;Oh, yes, I understand what you mean, wise ones...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24227;Perhaps it is you who require some of my charity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24228;We are the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24229;Who would have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24230;I was never meant to be a conqueror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24231;The ancient fire of the Great Wyrms flows within my veins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24234;[From.GetSheHeCap] who toils with the dragon tastes the flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24235;No! Wait! You cannot do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24237;Of course! You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24238;Naturally, you are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24239;All scholars are welcome at my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24240;Let darkness and violence be forever banned from our heavenly realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24251;Famuli vestrae pietatis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24252;It was bound to happen sooner or later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24253;I will have my revenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF24000;I must stop this madness before it gets out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24011;Nonsense! I have nothing in common with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24012;Foolish savages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24027;Make it disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24033;Greater battles await us yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24039;Rejoice! We will share our wealth with everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24052;I will bring prosperity and knowledge to my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24053;My dynasty's emblem will shine over all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24054;[Root.Capital.GetName] will be a capital of arts and philosophy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24055;I must be remembered, no matter how!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24056;The most learned scholars in the realm will look into this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24057;We must be patient in this transitory phase of the reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24059;I will hire an entire group of scholars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24060;I will dedicate my entire life to this venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24062;No price is too big to accomplish this holy quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24063;The findings of my scholars will speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24065;We will spare no expenses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24066;A grandiose new library is what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24068;All the priests [Root.Religion.GetName] must fall in line with my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24069;All activities must be overseen by the righteous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24071;I will hire scholars to look at and revise these laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24072;A couple of burned villages will send the right message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24100;Nah, I still like [Root.Educator.GetHerHim] well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24101;I was not born yesterday, you know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24104;I will get right on it, child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24107;How could I possibly be a murderer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24113;I wish to wait a bit more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24133;Fear not, my [From.GetLordLady]! I will protect you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24134;We will try to improve our formations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24135;And what of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24136;No! Stop! You are not supposed to go there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24137_A;I could use to lose some weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24137_B;I do not have time to worry about food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24138;I will share my wealth with the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24141;Who needs brains when you have looks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24142;Nobody has complained thus far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24143_A;I could use to be at least a *bit* heavier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24143_B;Why should I make this a problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24144;Disloyalty cannot be tolerated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24149;A keen mind is necessary to achieve peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24150;The more I squeeze, the tighter my grip over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24151;Not that I mind doing it, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24152;A [meddling_target.GetManWoman] of [meddling_target.GetHerHis] stature should strive for a better image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24153_A;[meddling_target.GetHerHisCap] drinking habits are intolerable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24153_B;[meddling_target.GetSheHeCap] should stop lazying about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24153_C;[meddling_target.GetSheHeCap] should try working harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24154;Would it kill [meddling_target.GetHerHim] to brush [meddling_target.GetHerHis] hair every once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24158;That is ridiculous! I was raised [Root.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24159;You are just jealous because you are old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24160;I have bigger responsibilities than looking pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24161;My diet is just fine as it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24200;It would be a fool's errand to try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24201;Establishing a valid claim would be a better investment of resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24202;I will buy the best equipment money can buy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24203;No scroll must remain untouched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24204;Everybody must know of this great discovery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24205;Forget the tomb, we will pursue another path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24207;We just need to look harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24209;The voice of the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will be heard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24210;And I could not be happier for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24220;The very thought betrays my impurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24221;They will be given our best accommodations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24222;But where is the line between bravery and recklessness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24223;I think you should  re-examine your definition of fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24224;Humility is relative to one's state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24225;Could we better determine the requirements of your test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24226;But how should be valued a gift requested?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24227;How can I fill the hole in this bowl, wise ones?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24230;What have I done with my life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24237;I am afraid you will have to look further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24238;I am afraid I must decline your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24239;I cannot soil my good name by employing criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF24251;This was but the Lord's triumph, I cannot accept this honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF24052;I will find my own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24056;I will be more careful during my court hearings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24057;I will try to address their concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24059;I can try researching myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24060;I will try to dedicate more time to grooming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24062;I will try to lead the search personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24063;These people are simply envious of my achievements!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24065;I will try to make the court a more welcoming haven for artists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24066;I will host the best amongst them in my court permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24068;The people will know of my great plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24069;I will exile some of the worst offenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24071;My council will deal with this in due time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24072;Their complaints are clearly irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24107;I will think of some better excuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24134;Maybe this is not the right time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24139;An impressive display, to be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24144;A responsible ruler must enforce discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24153;[From.GetSheHeCap] should start acting like a proper [scoped_founder.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24154;[meddling_target.GetSheHeCap] is always eating, I worry about [From.GetHerHis] health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24202;The bare minimum is all I can afford.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24203;Surely, a few more papers will be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24204;An official statement should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24209;It is no use. This was nothing but a huge waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24221;I am sure they will be honored to assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24222;I submit myself to your judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24223;I will try my best to impress you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24224;How can I possibly prove that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24225;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24226;I suppose I could make a show of charity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF24227;I have to care for the realm's stability as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF24056;This is too much effort for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24057;Better to scrap the entire reform then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24059;This is simply too much work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24060;I have greater responsibilities to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24062;I did not think this task would require such costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24063;I dare not upset the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24065;This task is too taxing for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24066;This is all well beyond my limited resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24068;This might be too risky to try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24069;These measures might create too much discontent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24071;These laws must have been created for a reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24072;Very well. I do not wish to risk a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24139;I have never met anybody like [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24222;What- What kind of proof do you need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24223;I am not so sure about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24224;Of course! I am the most humble [Root.GetTitle] ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24225;But I am humble! Are you blind?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24226;I imagine a second fistful of dust will not be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF24227;Still not enough to compare to a bowl of dirt?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHF24139;Such generosity must be repaid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF24223;This is impossible! Your standards are too high!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF24225;Enough. I cannot possibly prove this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF24227;Enough. I have spent too much already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHF24027;Burn it like the others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24222;I will let my deeds speak for themselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24223;I assure you, I will not disappoint you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24224;Let us talk of his story one more time, wise ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24225;I understand your concerns, but let us discuss the matter further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF24226;Behold, wise ones, the girth of my munificence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
