EVTDESC_CM_4100;You have begun preparations for the Festival of the Sun. You send out messengers with invitations to your vassals, expecting all to come and honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4101;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend the celebration of the Festival of the Sun at [From.Capital.GetName].\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4102;Your vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has refused your invitation to the Festival of the Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4120;The Festival of the Sun is about to start, and in accordance with tradition, the festivities begin on a sunny morning. Large crowds have gathered around, and priests walk among them distributing blessings in the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4130;The time has come for one of the main events of the Festival of the Sun - the ceremony known as Walking Under the Sun. A sunny day is chosen, and on it Zun's faithful walk barefoot around the circumference of the temple ninety-nine times, all the while chanting pious rhymes. It is a ritual of physical and spiritual cleansing, as well as a tribute to the Radiant Lord Zun.\n\nIt is known both for inspiring great piety and for causing great physical and mental exertion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4131;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. On the seventy-third lap around the temple, you start to feel a weakness and pain in your legs. You try to move forwards but your head is pounding and you struggle for breath. As you fall to your knees, you start to vomit on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4133;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, you start to see new and clearer perspectives on some things that previously seemed too mysterious to fathom. The sun is just a large cheese and the moon speaks soothing words about your feet. Oh those feet, how they bother you. Maybe you should cut them off?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4135;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, you start to feel a strange presence entering your mind. Yes, yes... the little devils that dwell underground in darkness have come to you and are sitting on your shoulder, invisible, telling you strange secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4137;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, you turn your face upwards towards the Sun. You feel the light and warmth coarse through your mind and body, and shudder with excitement. Only now have you fully understood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4139;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, you press on. You feel this ordeal is hardening you and giving you new strength. Perhaps you should take to doing similar exercises more frequently once the festival is over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4141;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, your mind wanders and you start to see new perspectives and angles on some familiar problems. Perhaps you should start thinking outside your usual patterns?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4143;You walk for hours in the sun to honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. As your limbs grow more tired and the heat pulses through your brain, you turn your face upwards towards the Sun. As you feel His strong warmth and presence embrace you, you open your eyes and stare into His face to embrace the divine mysteries to be seen therein. You stare for a long while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4190;The ceremony of thanksgiving to Zun the Giver of Justice is held in courtyard of the temple. All the attendants bare their heads and kneel to give thanks for the light, warmth, justice, wisdom and fertility that He gives His faithful worshipers. Bread spiced with holy saffron is passed around and consumed by the worshipers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4196;The Festival of the Sun is over for this time. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] has been properly honored and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His blinding gaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_4200;[From.GetTitledName] has declared [From.GetHerHis] renunciation of Iconoclasm, denouncing it as a heresy and officially returning the Empire to Orthodoxy. [From.GetSheHe] commands all [From.GetHerHis] subjects to follow suit and again venerate the holy icons and other religious art.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
