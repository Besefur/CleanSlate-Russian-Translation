EVTDESC_WOL_11101;You realize that to become a great fighter you would need to get in better shape. There's a great path in the nearby woods that would be excellent for running.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11102;Throughout the day you've caught yourself grinding your teeth and being unable to focus on anything for long. Suddenly you realize why you have been in a bad mood all day - you just can't seem to abide having lazy people in your presence any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11103;A small spear-throwing competition could be entertaining, and it's also a great way to enliven your battle technique. Maybe you should arrange a contest at your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11104;Everyone attending the spear-throwing competition seems to be having a great time. They are partaking in the contest, conversing and laughing together. Perhaps the merryment is a bit too much, as a spear is carelessly hurled into the field as someone is still out there, measuring the distance of the previous throw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11107;After dozens of spears have been hurled through the air, a sole victor emerges. No one managed to throw farther than you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_11110;Your daily routine involves repeatedly swinging your blade at a training dummy, however, you can only learn so much from fighting an inanimate enemy, and the practice gets dreadfully dull after a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11111;As you replace your training dummy with a real person, you find that facing an intelligent enemy is a lot harder, but also more rewarding. After many bruises and cuts, it's clear that you've gained experience and have better control of a fight than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11112;Even with blunt blades a training fight is a dangerous thing. Sometimes a sword might strike just a bit too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11115;I’ve invited people in my court to take part in a war game in which we practice defending our land from invading enemies. We will use wooden models to represent invading armies, and I shall have to use clever tactics to defeat my opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_11140_LOSS2;Our decision to attack an opponent who holds a defensive high-ground proves disastrous. As our troops suffer massive losses, we are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11140_LOSS3;With our troops being split up and exhausted, we cannot fight the united forces of [attacker.GetFirstName]. We fail to inflict any lasting damage on our opponent, and are quickly overwhelmed. It is clear that we are defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# First one is still used in new Holy Fury events
EVTDESC_WOL_11014;[From.GetBestName] did not take lightly on being defeated in a duel. [From.GetSheHeCap] has sworn to avenge [From.GetHerHis] defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_WOL_11000;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has challenged you to a duel. The only honorable response would be to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_WOL_11001;[From.GetBestName] has chosen to accept your challenge to personal combat. The duel will take place in the next few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_WOL_11002;The spineless, [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetTitledFirstName], has refused your challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_WOL_11012;You're well aware of your own ability, or lack of thereof, and therefore know that your duel with [From.GetBestName] will be onesided. Hoping to get the upper hand through surprise, you charge them the second they appear on the battleground. However, your sudden move doesn't faze them, and your desperate stabs are being easily parried. As [From.GetBestName] dodges one of your high blows, they get plenty of time to come up behind you and slash at your neck. There's no time to feel pain, as you fade from this world much too quickly to register your head being separated from the rest of your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_WOL_11013;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has stained your honor by forcing you down into the dirt in a duel. It is only natural that you start to plan your revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

For a while it seems like neither of you will gain the upper hand, until you manage to parry [opponent.GetBestName]'s blade and deliver a powerful blow to [opponent.GetHerHis] defensless arm. [opponent.GetSheHeCap] drops [opponent.GetHerHis] weapon on the ground and lets out a blood-curdling scream, staring in shock at the gruesome wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESCA_WOL_11007;The day of your duel has come, and you step up to your opponent, [From.GetBestName], while raising your blade. The fight starts off fiercely as neither of you hold back, the echo of clashing metal following every brutal attack. For a long time it's unclear who will stand victorious, until a parry throws you off balance, leaving you an open target.
