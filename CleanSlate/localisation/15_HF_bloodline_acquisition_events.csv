HF_201_DESC;As you hold little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] in your arms you feel something ominous eminate from [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] tiny eyes. They are not filled with the glee of a newborn babe, but with the determined ambition of a warrior... You are sure it is nothing, but the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] who delivered [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim] did claim the night of [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] birth unusual somehow, blessed perhaps? Although some would call it folly, you remember the night as one bearing prophecy.\n\nAs you put [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] back to bed, a shiver runs down your spine – in your mind's eye, an image of the world changing flashes past, where great kings bend the knee to your [child_of_destiny.GetDaughterSon].\n\nPerhaps it is time for you to go to bed, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_201_OPTA;Perhaps the world will change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_201_TITLE;Child of Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_211_DESC;Lying in the crib, I hear a slithering presence drawing closer and closer... What could this be, a friend? A foe? Before long, a hissing head peeks up over the edge. With glaring eyes and searching tongue, it moves towards me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_211_OPTA;Grab it by the neck and squeeze it hard, until it stops moving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_211_OPTB;You are cold, but here it is warm. Please, share my blanket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_212_DESC;As I check on little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName], I am terrified to discover a snake in [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] crib! Fortunately the snake is dead, but who killed it? It surely could not have been [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName]? I better keep an eye out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_213_DESC;As I check on little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName], I am terrified to discover a snake in [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] crib! Fortunately the snake seems to be sleeping, cuddled up next to [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName]. I quickly have a guard dispose of the serpent, though how did it manage to get in there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_214_DESC;As I check on little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName], I am terrified to discover a snake in [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] crib! The serpent hisses at me, the body of little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] lying next to it. [child_of_destiny.GetHerHisCap] tiny body is still, bloated with poison. Who would do this to such a small child?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_215_DESC;To keep an eye on me, the servant placed me on a table in the busy cookery. At the end of my table I see [spymaster_target.GetJobTitle] [spymaster_target.GetFirstName] mixing two vials together. As [spymaster_target.GetSheHe] turns [spymaster_target.GetHerHis] back to me, I crawl forward and grab the vial. It smells sweet! I down it all in one go. [spymaster_target.GetFirstName] turns back with a terrified expression on [spymaster_target.GetHerHis] face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_215_OPTA;I feel... strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_215_OPTB;I feel... strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_216_DESC;A terrified servant brings little [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] to me, tears running down her cheeks. She claims that [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] drank an entire vial of poison while in the cookery! Strangely enough, [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] does not look like [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is ailing at all... In fact [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is babbling as usual, smiling at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_216_OPTA;Calm yourself, can you not see that [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] is fine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_216_OPTB;That is... nice. Now take this obnoxious babe away, please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_217_DESC;I have been sent along with [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetPriestTitle] [priest_target.GetFirstName] to [temple_target.GetName] in order to learn more about the [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetName] faith. [priest_target.GetFirstName] tells me to pray in front of the candle-lit altar, eyes closed. Suddenly, a vision of [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetHighGodName] appears in front of my eyes! I was told such wondrous things, before [priest_target.GetFirstName] interrupted me – I had apparently been shouting passages from [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetScriptureName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_217_OPTA;I was told that I, too, would become a god one day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_217_OPTB;I was told the truth, and I will fight for [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_218_DESC;I had [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] accompany [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetPriestTitle] [priest_target.GetFirstName] to the temple of [temple_target.GetName], to learn more about the [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetName] faith. Upon retuning, [priest_target.GetFirstName] claims that [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] had a vision from [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetHighGodName] while praying! Apparently my [child_of_destiny.GetDaughterSon] loudly proclaimed passages from [child_of_destiny.Religion.GetScriptureName], which [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] had no way of knowing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_218_OPTA;Perhaps [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is... blessed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_218_OPTB;Why do you bother me with this? Send [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim] back to [temple_target.GetName] for all I care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_219_DESC;As I am out wandering I come across a warrior named [great_warrior_target.GetFirstName] who is decimating a hapless training dummy with impressive ease. Intrigued, I ask [great_warrior_target.GetHerHim] to teach me. At first [great_warrior_target.GetSheHe] just laughs, but eventually [great_warrior_target.GetSheHe] relents. Many hours pass, we practice swordsmanship and study the Art of War. I have never had this much fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_219_OPTA;When I grow up, no one will ever best me in combat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_219_OPTB;My stratagems shall leave all enemies dumbfounded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_220_DESC;Just as I start to wonder where [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] is, a servant comes bearing news. Apparently [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] has spent all day practicing swordsmanship with a warrior named [great_warrior_target.GetFirstNameWithNick]! According to the servant, [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] shows great promise as a fighter and strategist – [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] evidently left [great_warrior_target.GetFirstName] very impressed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_220_OPTA;Great news! This child will go far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_220_OPTB;Hm, better not promote these tendencies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_221_DESC;Bored, I decide to sneak out onto the streets of [child_of_destiny.Location.County.GetName]. I suddenly hear a voice. "Ah, young [child_of_destiny.GetPrincessPrince] [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName]!" It is an old [wise_man_target.GetManWoman], overburdened with books. "I am [wise_man_target.GetFirstName]. The stars have given me a quest – to teach you about the world and the mind of man." [wise_man_target.GetSheHeCap] holds out two books. "Our time is limited, which tome should we study?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_221_OPTA;"Virtute Animi", I want to lead and inspire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_221_OPTB;"Dominus Omnium", my future realm shall prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_222_DESC;My servants apparently lost track of [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] today, and it took hours to locate [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim]! [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] was found in the nick of time, just before I was about to order a full-scale search. When they found [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim] [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] was reading a book no one had ever seen before, written in Latin no less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_222_OPTA;[child_of_destiny.GetFirstName], oh how you scared me...! And how do you know Latin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_222_OPTB;Ridiculous... dispose of that book, and keep an eye on [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_223_DESC;I have always been very beloved, though until now I have never thought much about it. Wherever I go, others my age admire me with obvious infatuation! I am constantly showered with compliments and gifts, like I was a [child_of_destiny.GetKingQueen]! I am the center of attention wherever I go, and I like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_223_OPTA;Perhaps one of the [child_of_destiny.GetBoyGirlOpp]s will win my heart one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_223_OPTB;I do not like limiting my options...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_224_DESC;[child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] is no mere child anymore, that much is evident. [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] is constantly surrounded by young infatuated admirers, and [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is obviously enjoying the attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_224_OPTA;[child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] sure is popular with children [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] age...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_224_OPTB;How quaint. Guards, please relocate all of these annoying admirers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_225_DESC;As I sit in my room, I hear a rustling sound outside the [child_of_destiny.GetChamberOpening]. Suddenly, a [attempted_murderer.GetManWoman] bursts in, brandishing a rusty [GetRandomWeapon]! [attempted_murderer.GetSheHeCap] is covered head-to-toe in blood, and screeches maniacally: "[attempted_murderer.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] will have your soul!" I quickly grab a red-hot poker from the fireplace and the [attempted_murderer.GetManWoman], in [attempted_murderer.GetHerHis] frenzy, impales [attempted_murderer.GetHerselfHimself] on it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_225_OPTA;I can not trust anyone after this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_225_OPTB;This must have been divine intervention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_226_DESC;Grave news! This very night, [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] was assaulted in [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] [child_of_destiny.GetChamber]! An assassin somehow managed to sneak into the [Root.GetHolding], killing any guard in [attempted_murderer.GetHerHis] way. In a stroke of luck, [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] managed to impale the assailant on a fire poker. [attempted_murderer.GetSheHeCap] was later identified as [attempted_murderer.GetFullName], who the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s had long suspected of deviancy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_226_OPTA;By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], how could this happen? Redouble the guard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_226_OPTB;By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], what if they come for me next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_227_DESC;Wherever I go, all eyes are upon me. One [sex_partner.GetManWoman] in particular stands out – [sex_partner.GetSheHe] is stunningly [sex_partner.GetBeautifulHandsome], and looks at me with such hunger in [sex_partner.GetHerHis] eyes... Perhaps I should encourage [sex_partner.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_227_OPTA;Join me in my [child_of_destiny.GetChamber] for some... [child_of_destiny.GetAlcohol]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_227_OPTB;I have more important matters to attend to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_228_DESC;In order to teach me how to hunt, [marshal_target.GetJobTitle] [marshal_target.GetFirstName] has brought me into the forest. We are silently moving through the shrubbery as I spot a [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalSmallGameAnimal]! I give chase, running until I manage to get a clear shot off – it is a kill! I turn around to face [marshal_target.GetFirstName] with a gleeful smile on my face, but in [marshal_target.GetHerHis] stead is a massive [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]! I ready my spear, and then I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_228_OPTA;... use a rock as leverage and puncture the neck of the [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] as it attacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_228_OPTB;... run towards the nearby cliff and feint the [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] so it falls off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_229_DESC;I am awestruck when I see what [marshal_target.GetJobTitle] [marshal_target.GetFirstName] and [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] has brought back from their hunt. A trophy from a massive [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]! I thought they were hunting for [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalSmallGameAnimal]... [marshal_target.GetFirstName] ensures me that [marshal_target.GetSheHe] and [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] tracked the [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] together, and that [marshal_target.GetSheHe] absolutely did not lose track of where [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] was, only arriving after the [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] was already dead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_229_OPTA;What? How can this be? Sounds highly suspect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_229_OPTB;Unbelievable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_230_DESC;Horrible news! While out hunting with [marshal_target.GetJobTitle] [marshal_target.GetFirstName], [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] was killed by a massive [child_of_destiny.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]! According to [marshal_target.GetJobTitle] [marshal_target.GetFirstName] the beast came out of nowhere and devoured [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] in one big gulp, before turning on [marshal_target.GetHerHim] and chasing [marshal_target.GetHerHim] out of the forest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_231_ALT_DESC;The time has come. My blood burns with ambition, I can stay idle no longer! It is my destiny to become [child_of_destiny.GetKingQueen], and I have the support I need to realize it! My eyes are set upon [target_invasion_character.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and all the riches that lie within...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_231_DESC;My blood burns with ambition, I can stay idle no longer! It is my destiny to become [child_of_destiny.GetKingQueen], and I have the support I need to realize it! Just one question remains, should I focus my ambition inwards, or outwards? Should I stay and fight for the throne of [top_liege_match_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName], or should I abandon my past and look towards [target_invasion_character.PrimaryTitle.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_231_OPTA;My destiny is to rule [top_liege_match_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_231_OPTB;I shall lead my armies towards [target_invasion_character.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_231_OPTC;The time is not right... I will give it more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_232_DESC;I always expected [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] to do this, though I hoped the day would never come... [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] has, with popular support, laid claim to [top_liege_match_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName]! With a massive host of willing soldiers backing [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] claim, I fear it will not be long before a civil war breaks out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_232_OPTA;Please, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], make my [child_of_destiny.GetSonDaughter] see reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_232_OPTB;Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] ambition will ruin us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_233_DESC;It seems as if [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] has decided that [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] ambitions will never be realized as long as [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] stays in [top_liege_match_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] has attracted a massive host of eager soldiers, willing to fight and die for [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim], which he is steering towards the realm of [target_invasion_character.GetFullName]. I fear [target_invasion_character.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is doomed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_233_OPTA;This is the last drop, [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] is out of the will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_233_OPTB;What a relief! Now [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] is [target_invasion_character.GetFirstName]s problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_234_DESC;Lately my thoughts have been shaded by dark clouds. Today I read a book about an ancient hero, and [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] reminds me of myself! [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] fights impossible odds, and overcomes hardships similar to my own. It is as if the hero of the book and myself share a destiny! I must not doubt myself, this world will be mine one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_234_OPTA;Beware, darkness - for I shall banish you from my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_235_DESC;My natural charisma has led me to become very popular. Other kids do not dare to pick on me, as I have many friends who would come to my aid at a moments notice. In fact, there is always someone following me around. Whatever I want them to do, they will do for me – in the playground, I rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_235_OPTA;When I am [child_of_destiny.GetKingQueen], loyalty will be rewarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_235_OPTB;They say they would die for me, I like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_236_DESC;[child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] seems to be very charismatic – in the playground [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is always 'guarded' by at least three other children. It would almost seem as if [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is building the foundation of a very young army...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_236_OPTA;I am glad that my [child_of_destiny.GetSonDaughter] is making friends, I suppose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_236_OPTB;Ominous, children should not act like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_237_DESC;I thought I was going to rot in prison forever, until I heard a voice outside my cell. "Be very silent, I am getting you out of here!" the voice whispers. It is [savior_target.GetFullName], come to save me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_237_OPTA;Let us escape from here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_237_OPTB;No, I quite like it here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_238_DESC;During the night, [child_of_destiny.GetFullName] escaped from my dungeons! [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] was apparently helped by [savior_target.GetFullName], who has joined [child_of_destiny.GetHerHim] at [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_238_OPTA;Preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_239_DESCA;[child_of_destiny.GetFullName], who was imprisoned by [jailer_target.GetFullName], has escaped during the night! [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] was apparently helped by [savior_target.GetFullName], who has joined [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_239_DESCB;[child_of_destiny.GetFullName], who was imprisoned by [jailer_target.GetFullName], has escaped during the night! [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] was apparently helped by [savior_target.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_239_OPTA;Huh, impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_240_DESC;I know that the key to success lies in who I let close to me. No great [child_of_destiny.GetManWoman] ever reached the top without having at least a couple of loyal friends by their side – and I intend to choose only the most useful of people to stand by my side. There are many people clamoring for my attention, but who should I encourage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_240_OPTA;Someone powerful, to aid me if I need help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_240_OPTB;Someone in a position to further my goals...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_240_OPTC;Someone wise and clever, to provide counsel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_240_OPTD;I do not like either of these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_291_DESC;It all went very fast. [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName], famous as [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is, has had no trouble amassing a vast host of eager warriors. With [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] eyes set upon the realm of [target_character.GetFullName] they now embark on their adventure, without so much as a farewell. There truly were no way controlling the ambition of that [child_of_destiny.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_291_OPTA;I hope my [child_of_destiny.GetDaughterSon] does not forget about me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_291_OPTB;The audacity of that [child_of_destiny.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HF_300_DESC;The time has finally come! I have left the shackles of childhood behind me, ready to seize my destiny. As a [child_of_destiny.GetManWoman] I am free to forge my own path, and the path I intend to forge is paved with my unbridled ambition. Beware, world, for I am here to tame you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_300_OPTA;Thus it begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_301_DESC;After having survived a childhood more perilous than those of most old stories, [child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] has grown into a magnificent young [child_of_destiny.GetManWoman]. Having shown nothing but promise throughout [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] entire upbringing, [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] has eclipsed all of [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] teachers and become a masterful strategist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_301_OPTA;My dear [child_of_destiny.GetDaughterSon], is it not time to rest for a while now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_301_OPTB;I dare not think what [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is getting up to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_303_DESC;Finally, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is mine! Now, how do I wish to rule over my new subjects? Should I impose my beliefs and traditions upon them, or should I adapt to their culture and morals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_303_OPTA;I shall adopt both their traditions and faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_303_OPTB;I will adopt their traditions, but I will not abandon [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_303_OPTC;Their faith speaks to me... adopting it could further my plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_303_OPTD;I will not change, they will have to get used to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_304_DESC;Ever since I was a child I dreamt about this moment, to seize a crown and name myself [Root.GetTitle], and now it has finally come true! But my ambitions know no bounds – for as long as I live, I shall conquer. My name shall be known across the world, and my legacy will last for millennia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_304_OPTA;I have seized my destiny, though it does not end here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_305_DESC;A great conqueror by the name of [child_of_destiny.GetFirstNameWithNick] has invaded and taken over the realm of [child_of_destiny.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [child_of_destiny.GetSheHeCap] is a [child_of_destiny.GetManWoman] of unrivaled ambition, with eyes set on the rest of the known world. Time will tell if [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] will build an empire to rival that of Alexander the Great himself, or if [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] will march [child_of_destiny.GetHerHis] army into oblivion in the Gedrosian desert...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_305_OPTA;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] help us all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_305_TIT;[child_of_destiny.GetFirstName] the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_306_DESC;Lying in my bed I glance out through the open window. In the stars I can see my destiny, the soft light dancing in front of my eyes – telling of the many adventures I will have, the friends I will make, and the Kingdoms I will rule. It is comforting to know that the stars align just for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_306_OPTA;When I am older I will seize what is mine, but for now I will rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_307_DESC;[child_of_destiny.GetFullName] was designated a Child of Destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_307_OPTA;O shit waddup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HF_OPT_MORE_GUARDS;We need more guards in here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_OPT_MY_CHILD;My child! No! You were destined for greatness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_OPT_NOT_MY_CHILD;Phew! At least [child_of_destiny.GetSheHe] is not MY [child_of_destiny.GetDaughterSon].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
