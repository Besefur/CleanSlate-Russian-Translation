EVTDESC_HF_11026;Each swing of my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] has sent me deeper into enemy territory. Before I know it, I am surrounded. With a burst of energy, I roar loudly, causing a few of them to hesitate and one unfortunate soldier to stagger backwards, tripping over a rock. I can't help but notice that [Root.GetSheHe] drops [Root.GetHerHis] weapon in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_11027;The enemies are falling by my [GetDuelWeapon], one by one, while hails of arrows narrowly miss me. Charging into the thick of it all, I corner one surprisingly young soldier, trying to hide behind a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence]. With mixed emotions, I realize that the boy is shaking. "Who are you?!" he splutters, eyes frantic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_11001_A;A bird cries out and I wake up. I hear men roaring in the distance. Why am I on the ground, staring at the sky? I... I cannot move.\nIs this how [Root.GetBestName] leaves this world?\n"Go with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]", comes the ragged voice of a wounded soldier next to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11001_B;I cannot stop coughing. Something is filling my lungs. An enemy soldier is shouting orders, but I am having a hard time focusing on the words. My knees give way, and I am on the ground, dropping my [GetDuelWeapon].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11001_C;I am surrounded. Blood is streaking down my face and my [GetDuelWeapon] has begun to feel heavy. A huge [GetRegionalFerociousAnimal] of a man is looming towards me, but seems to decide that I am not worth the trouble. I have just enough time to wonder why before someone runs a sword through my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11002;During the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], the enemy cornered my commander [home_commander.GetTitledName], [home_commander.GetOnCombatDeathDesc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11003;During the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName] I manage to corner and cut down [home_commander.GetTitledName], hopefully teaching [home_commander.GetHerHis] troops a valuable lesson.\nIn the aftermath, my scouts find a weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11004_A;A weapon has been found by my soldiers. "It was dropped by [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], my [Root.GetLordLady], at the recent battle of [battlefield_location.GetName]" my commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] says, presenting the item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11004_B;A weapon has been found by my troops. "We are told that it belonged to [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], my [Root.GetLordLady]" an officer says, presenting the item. "It must have been lost during the recent battle of [battlefield_location.GetName]", [Root.GetSheHe] concludes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11005_A;In the chaos surrounding the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName] my men cornered [home_commander.GetTitledName], [home_commander.GetOnCombatDeathDesc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11005_B;In the battle chaos of [battlefield_location.GetName] my men cornered [home_commander.GetTitledName], [home_commander.GetOnCombatDeathDesc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_A;The [battlefield_location.GetLocalWeatherAdjective] weather is getting to me. Turning to the sky, I take a deep breath. The [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] soldiers of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been sending their best at me and my limbs are becoming heavier with each step I take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_B;While my soldiers are fighting valiantly alongside me, one [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] buffoon wearing the colors of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have figured out that I am the one holding the troops together. Through the haze of my tired mind, I sense [Root.GetHerHis] lumbering advance, and [Root.GetHerHis] intent to do something about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11010_C;My troops are performing with excellence, and my chest is swelling with pride as we keep pressing forward. I turn back to answer the call of a soldier near by, when suddenly there is a sharp pain in my [Root.GetBodyPartInjured]. Gritting my teeth, I hear an enemy shouting: "Stay down, you [GetRootFromInsult]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_A;The landscape surrounding [battlefield_location.GetName] is a sight to behold. I wish I was not here for a battle. Once all of this is over, maybe I will come out here with [my_beloved.GetFirstName]..?\nMy [GetDuelWeapon] is suddenly kicked out of my hand, and a scruffy-looking soldier shouts, voice like a demon: "I'll get your [GetBodyPartInjured]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_B_1;"You [GetRootFromInsult]!" the [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName] soldier yells as he charges at me, his expression more that of a wild animal than man. For a moment time stands still, as I am watching the movement of a shiny sword coming straight for my [GetBodyPartInjured].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_B_2;"You [GetRootFromInsult]!" the [enemy_commander.Culture.GetName] soldier yells as [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] charges at me, [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] expression more that of a wild animal than [enemy_commander.GetManWoman]. For a moment time stands still, as I am watching the movement of a shiny sword coming straight for my [GetBodyPartInjured].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11011_C; I try to breathe deeply, but catching my breath in the [battlefield_location.GetLocalTemperature] weather is difficult. "Look, it's the [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetHerselfHimself]!" someone shouts. I turn, only to find myself overrun by a dozen of [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s [enemy_liege.GetEnemySoldierDesc] soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11012_A;One moment I am shouting orders, surrounded by the clanging of swords and fighting around me. The next, everything goes dark, as the world slips away from me. Are those... people, concerned faces? Everything hurts. I just want to... rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11012_B;One moment I am shouting orders, surrounded by the clanging of swords and fighting around me. Then my memory fades, and I find myself on the ground, lying in a mixture of blood and [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc], my ears ringing with pain. A soldier runs past me, but he seems to assume I am dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11013_A;It has been ages since I felt so invigorated by a battle. "Every day, our unit is moving as if connected by some unspoken bond", I exclaim eagerly one night. "Or a higher power of some kind!"\n"Uhm, this is all you, my [Root.GetLordLady]", one of my soldier says, a look of genuine surprise on his face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11014_A;As I describe the plan for our movement across the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], my officers listen intently before running back to their units to pass on the instructions. Morale has been good lately. Conflicts are non-existent within our regiment, and we are becoming famous for our [Root.GetMilitarySquadPride].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11015;Rumors are trickling in from the troops present at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName]. My commander [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] has been making a great impression on [home_commander.GetHerHis] soldiers, and [home_commander.GetHerHis] regiment is famous for their [home_commander.GetMilitarySquadPride]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11016;Our ongoing struggle outside of [battlefield_location.Capital.GetName] has brought out the best of our military strategists. One of them is a [invited_character.Culture.GetName] veteran with a penchant for innovation. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] is suggesting that [invited_character.GetSheHe] retire from the battlefront, and return to [home_capital_province.GetName] to continue [invited_character.GetHerHis] work, safe from flying arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11017;"One day, you'll have to specialize". I hear the voice of my old quartermaster in my head. As I look out over the battlefield and the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName], the sight fills me with resolve. I need to find a focus for future battles, but what will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_armor;Just as I am about to cut [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] in two, the enemy commander wriggles out of [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor, picks [home_commander.GetHerselfHimself] up, and runs the other way. Dumbfounded, my soldiers and I are left lowering our weapons, staring as the half-naked runner disappears from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_other;"Any last words?!" I shout, as I am about to cut down [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], the enemy commander. The [home_commander.GetManWoman] groans and tosses something into the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc] between us. I hesitate for a second, and my enemy uses the opportunity to start running away, leaving me staring at the item on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_A_weapon;Just as I am about to cut the enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] throws [home_commander.GetHerHis] weapon to the ground, scrambles to [home_commander.GetHerHis] feet and starts running. My soldiers trip over each other in their sudden attempt to catch up with [home_commander.GetHerHim], but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_armor;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] wriggled out of [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor and ran the other way, causing such a distraction that "[home_commander.GetSheHe] probably got away uninjured", the courier says, handing me the bounty. "Unless [home_commander.GetSheHe] ran into a tree, my [Root.GetLordLady]".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_other;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] tossed something in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc], distracting my soldiers and making a hasty escape. "But [home_commander.GetSheHe] left this behind, [Root.GetMasterMistress]", the courier says, handing me the bounty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11018_B_weapon;I am told that just as my soldiers were about to cut an enemy commander in two, the [home_commander.GetManWoman] threw [home_commander.GetHerHis] weapon to the ground, scrambled to [home_commander.GetHerHis] feet and left [home_commander.GetHerHis] enemies staring in confusion. "[home_commander.GetSheHeCap] dropped this, my [Root.GetLordLady]" the courier says, handing me the bounty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11019_A;Ever since the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], I find it hard to be near my children, for fear of being sent away again. I cannot stand the thought of us losing each other, and this distance is better. Surely, it is better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11019_B;Having returned from the battlefield, I still don't feel at home. My body is here, but my mind is still in [battlefield_location.GetName]. Sometimes I wonder if I died there and this is all a nightmare. Sometimes I cannot breathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11019_C;After the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], it has been my duty to inform the families of fallen soldiers of their fate. At night, I still see the hatred burning in the eyes of a teenage daughter. I know it is not my fault, but I have destroyed their lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11020;We are marching [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], when one of my officers mutters: "Once I'm back in [home_capital_province.GetName], I'm giving up this soldiering life and... Maybe I will be a baker!" I chuckle, considering my own more strategic aspirations. "What about you, my [Root.GetLordLady]? What will you focus on in the future?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11021;"[Root.GetFirstName]! You [Root.GetEnemySoldierDesc] brute!" a shout carries [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], where I am fighting a close battle alongside my personal guards. In the distance, I see enemy reinforcements coming our way. "Listen-", I begin to my soldiers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11022;I am [GetRidingMarching] [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName] when I realize how this experience has simply become matter of course. I rarely even think when I charge into battle – it just happens! I could surely make use of this insight, but how?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11023;There are people who would say that my interrogation techniques are appalling, but I would remind them that this is war. There is no such thing as 'unnecessary violence'. Turning back to my prisoner, I continue out loud: "Where are the rest of your troops hiding? Hmm?! I'll search the whole [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!". I am met with sobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11024;I interrupted Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] while [From.GetSheHe] was interrogating an prisoner to find out where our enemy would attack next. The guard who brought me to [From.GetFirstName] accused [From.GetHerHim] of using unnecessary violence and looked at me for support. "My [Root.GetLordLady]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_cat;My cat has become a true treasure here [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], acting as an anchoring kindness to any injured soldier. Of course, I was annoyed when I first found that it had gone to sleep in one of my saddle bags and followed me into battle, but now I am really coming around to- *thwack*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_dog;As I'm swinging my blade [Root.GetClumsilyElegantly] in front of me, my trusted dog gnaws at the legs of my enemies, and the battle rages on [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]. Then there is a cry from a soldier nearby. "Incoming arrows! My [Root.GetLordLady], watch out! Wait, what is that dog-" *thwack*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_eagle;Not everybody has a personal bodyguard in the shape of a majestic eagle at their side. More than once [Root.GetSheHe] has aided my attacks here [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] and charging at my enemies, knocking them off their horses, into the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]. There is a comfort in the screeching echoing above me. I am just concerned about-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_falcons;Riding [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] I am finding my strength draining from me. Sweat is mixing with dirt and blood down my face and I see an enemy knocking an arrow, taking aim at me. Then I see a bird, swooping down, picking at the rider's face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_fallback;Riding [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], I see a group of [enemy_commander.GetEnemySoldierDesc] soldiers coming for my unit, weapons raised.\nWhen they are finished with us, all my men are dead. I sink to my knees in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc], wondering why I am still here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_horse;My horse and I are of one mind and body. Having trained together for long, the enemy has begun fearing us both. "Watch out, it's [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetWarhorseName]!" they tell each other. When I sleep, [Root.GetWarhorseName] sleeps. So when a blade cuts into [Root.GetHerHim], I feel like I bleed too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11025_owl;Some argued when my owl came with us on this campaign, but between the comforting presence it brings our strategic meetings and the distracting screeching it offers our enemies, protests have ceased. "Attack!" I yell [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], and my owl swooshes above my head. Then I see the arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11028;I feel the power of [GetWarriorLodgeSymbol] flowing through my veins, as I snarl at the enemy commander, visibly startling [enemy_commander.GetHerHim]. "Surrender!" [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] shouts. "I am [enemy_commander.GetBestName], and-" The [enemy_commander.GetManWoman]'s words are cut short by my weapon [GetWeaponSwinging] through [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11029;My commander [home_commander.GetBestName] has been reported to perform impressively [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName]. Most recently, rumor has it that [home_commander.GetSheHe] ruthlessly decapitated an enemy commander, before immediately [home_commander.GetRidingMarching] onwards, to face [home_commander.GetHerHis] next foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11030;My [home_liege.GetRootRelation] [home_liege.GetTitledFirstName] is apparently thoroughly impressed by my battle technique. A missive I have received speaks at length about my bravery, and of people telling stories about the decapitation of [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11031;I am staring down the [home_commander.GetEnemySoldierDesc] enemy commander, trying to gauge what on earth [home_commander.GetHerHis] armor actually consists of. Are those... rat pelts? My thoughts begin to trail off and I proceed to demand [home_commander.GetHerHis] surrender. But then suddenly the world is spinning, and someone shouts: "Dodge for the flying head!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11032;My commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] has been slain [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.GetName]. "Decapitated, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the courier says, shuddering. "It was [home_commander.GetTitledFirstName], from [home_commander.Society.GetName]", he continues, averting my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11033_A;[From.GetBestName] did not appreciate the fate [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] met with at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName], and has sworn to take matters into [From.GetHerHis] own hands. All this fuss over head on a pike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11033_B;[From.GetBestName] must not have heard how I refused to take the head of my enemy as a trophy, because I am told that the [From.GetManWoman] has sworn to take vengeance on me, for the fate [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] met with at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11034;On our way to the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] of [battlefield_location.Capital.GetName], a huge boulder blocks our path. Having been [GetRidingMarching] for days, my muscles are aching for a real challenge. "Recruit!", I bark at a young [Root.GetBoyGirl] carrying a weapon far too big for [Root.GetHerHis] hands. "Hand me that hammer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11035;On our way through the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], a gigantic boulder blocks our path. Commander [From.GetTitledFirstName] is arguing at length with [From.GetHerHis] officers about whether we should try [GetRidingMarching] around the river crossing or not, when suddenly I hear them shouting my name, gesturing in my direction with a huge hammer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11036;[my_fellow_commander.GetTitledFirstName] is a belligerent commander, fighting with the strength of a [GetRandomMythologicalCreature]. Not that anyone is keeping count, but I find myself wondering how many enemies [my_fellow_commander.GetSheHe] has taken down single-handedly at this point... "Save some for me, will you?" I call across the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_A_1;Nostalgia comes easily in the soft light of a campfire. Last night, one eager soldier blessed us with a riveting tale of the battle that claimed the life of my [target.GetRootRelation], [target.GetBestName]. As I am [GetRidingMarching] onto the battlefield today, I let the past fuel my resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_A_2;In the light of the campfire, my men often talk about heroes of old. Last night, one of them blessed us with a fabulous tale of the battle that claimed the life of [target.GetBestName]. I never gave it that much thought, but [GetRidingMarching] onto the battlefield, I find myself lingering on the story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_B_1;It was long ago I felt so good about being in charge of a regiment. Today, while lying in wait for an ambush, one nervous officer confessed that there was a time when the stories about my command were all over [home_capital_province.GetName]. "It's what made me vow to join the [Root.Culture.GetName] army, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [Root.GetSheHe] murmurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_B_2;I remember hearing the stories from [home_capital_province.GetName], about the command and leadership of [target.GetBestName]. "It is important to have role models", I said at the time. Today, I look out over my regiment, thankful for all the great leaders that came before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_C_1;"No, I do not drink from the skulls of my enemies" I laugh, when one curious recruit lets slip a question about that time when I decapitated an enemy on the battlefield. [GetSkullTrophyComment];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11037_C_2;"If [target.GetTitledFirstName] drank from the skulls of [target.GetHerHis] enemies?" I ask. The recruit nods eagerly. I laugh, putting my arm around [Root.GetHerHim] conspiratorially: "Of course, there is a secret chamber back home in [home_capital_province.Capital.GetName], where [target.GetSheHe] is rumored to have bathed in their blood". The recruit grows pale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11038;"I am one with [GetWarriorLodgeSymbol]", I find myself chanting with each swing of my [GetDuelWeapon]. "For [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!" I roar, my weapon [GetWeaponSwinging] the soul out of any who dare step in my way. Bodies and blood fill the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], and I keep bellowing my battle cry, awash in a river of extinguished lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11039;Commander [From.GetTitledFirstName] keeps throwing me looks across the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], as I am [GetWeaponSwinging] my way through our enemies. Just as I begin to get uncomfortable by the surveillance, [From.GetSheHe] calls out: "Save some for me, will you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11040;I was chasing [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], when [commander_to_the_rescue.GetTitledFirstName] shoved me aside, barking "I'll take this one, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [commander_to_the_rescue.GetClumsilyElegantly] swinging [commander_to_the_rescue.GetHerHis] [commander_to_the_rescue.GetDuelWeapon]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11041;[home_commander.GetTitledFirstName] is reported to have been chasing down [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain], when my commander [commander_to_the_rescue.GetTitledFirstName] decided to intervene, [commander_to_the_rescue.GetBattleRescueDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11042_A;The enemy commander [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is not playing fair, and has me completely cornered up against a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence]. Behind [other_combatant.GetHerHim], a group of [other_combatant.GetHerHis] soldiers are moving closer. They are laughing, mocking me, thirsting for blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11042_B;The enemy commander [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon] with increasing precision, and I am beginning to think that I will die here, [battlefield_location.GetInOn] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11042_C;I cannot believe what is happening, but with each swing of [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon] [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is getting closer and closer to winning this fight. Jumping back to avoid yet another frighteningly lucky blow, I find myself backed up against a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11043_A;It seems that the enemy commander [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] actually expected me to play fair when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] chased me down on the battlefield. "Just you and me!" the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] demanded, sword held high. My men quickly joined me in taking the fool down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11043_B;I was swinging my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] with increasing precision, but I am not sure the enemy commander [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] realized that [other_combatant.GetSheHe] was going to perish on this battlefield, until I landed a deadly blow to [other_combatant.GetHerHis] skull, cracking it audibly open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11043_C;It was surprising, but with each swing of my [Root.GetDuelWeapon], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] seemed to have increasing difficulty controlling [other_combatant.GetHerHis] stance. All in all it was close, but in the end I landed a lucky blow to [other_combatant.GetHerHis] temple...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11046_A;"I yield!" [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls out. Sweat dripping down my forehead, I am holding my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] high, a deadly blow about to come down on my enemy. "You what?!" I demand. The [From.GetManWoman] drops to [From.GetHerHis] knees. "I'll be your prisoner! I'll be of more use to you alive" [From.GetSheHe] cries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11046_B;"W-wait! I yield!" [From.GetTitledFirstName] cries out. My [Root.GetDuelWeapon] high, I slow the deadly blow about to come down on my enemy. The [From.GetManWoman] scrambles backwards, almost tripping over [From.GetHerselfHimself]. "I'll be your prisoner! Spare my life!" [From.GetSheHe] whimpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11048;In the heat of the battle, my commander [From.GetTitledName], has been slain in one-on-one duel, between [From.GetHerHim] and [FromFrom.GetBestName]. It is said the [From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to surrender, but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11049_A;In the middle of battle I catch sight of a [my_dear.GetBoyGirl] wearing the same colors I am. I just have time to notice the fierce expression on [my_dear.GetHerHis] face, when [my_dear.GetSheHe] is struck down. I feel a pang of guilt, realizing how much [my_dear.GetSheHe] reminded me of my [my_dear.GetRootRelation] [my_dear.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11049_B;During the battle I catch sight of a [my_dear.GetFaceDescription] [my_dear.GetManWoman] who looks a lot like my [my_dear.GetRootRelation] [my_dear.GetTitledFirstName]. Then [my_dear.GetSheHe] is struck down. Suddenly, I am pushing soldiers out of the way, hurrying over to where I saw [my_dear.GetHerHim] fall. I know it is not [my_dear.GetFirstName], but I cannot help myself...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11050_A;I could have sworn I heard the enemy commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] barking orders, but as I search the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] is nowhere to be found. A fellow soldier finally informs me that [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] has been spotted cowering in the far back behind a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence], and most disgracefully, behind [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11050_B;Things are going well, when suddenly I hear an embarrassed huff from nearby. Spinning, my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] ready, I see the enemy commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] awkwardly attempting to climb a [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence]. "I think [enemy_commander.GetSheHe] is trying to escape the battle, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the soldier next to me muses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_11050_C;This campaign has been easy pickings. Swinging my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] [battlefield_location.GetThroughOver] the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] is a pleasure, and my fellow soldiers are equally jovial surrounded by the blood of our [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName] enemies and the cries of battle. "Look! Enemy commander [enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName] is hiding!" someone suddenly shouts, pointing off in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_HFP_11010_A;I accept any injury, if it protects [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_1;I think I will rest behind this [battlefield_location.GetTreeRockFence] for a moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_2;They will have to catch me first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_B_3;You don't have to ask me twice! I will stay down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_Bard_1;I must survive, so I can compose a ballad of my trials!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_Bard_2;Let me sing you the one about the idiot [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_Bard_3;Ooh, insults? I know a song, mocking [enemy_liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_Bard_3_TT;Through clenched jaws, you begin humming a familiar tune, throwing your enemy off completely...!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11010_C;Heeey, leave my [Root.GetBodyPartInjured] alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_A;You won't get the best of me – I need that [Root.GetBodyPartInjured]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B;Wait! How about you just take this [equipped_artifact.GetName] and let me live?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B_TT_armor;You wriggle out of your armor and leave it in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]. Then you run.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B_TT_fallback;You throw §Y[equipped_artifact.GetName]§! to the ground. Then you run.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_B_TT_weapon;You throw your weapon to the ground. Then you run.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_1;Hah! I will try to remember that one, for my next battle chant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_1_TT;You run away, abandoning your fellow soldiers, and leaving behind a confused enemy.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_2;*gulp* Wait! Have you heard the one about the [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName] [enemy_liege.GetRegionalSmallGameAnimal]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_2_TT;You attempt to talk your way out the situation. It is not entirely successful.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_3;Come to hear me sing, have you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_Bard_3_TT;You begin shouting a hymn of battle, the soldiers next to picking up the tune, just as you practiced...!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_HFP_11011_C;I don't think so – I'll duel Commander [enemy_commander.GetFirstName] myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_11002;Another one bites the dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11012;The fight will have to go on... without me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11012_tt;§Y[Root.GetBestName]§! receives a crushing blow to the head and shows no sign of waking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11013;This is a team effort, soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11014;Good leadership requires trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11015;Let [home_commander.GetHerHim] be a shining example for our recruits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11016;This sounds like a solid investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11019_1;I need a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11019_2;I do NOT have nightmares, servant! How dare you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11020;Logistics and organization, my good [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11021;We are going to DESTROY them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11022;I will master the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11023_A;I...The look on your face. You're just a boy...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11023_B;Crying will get you nowhere. You are but a tool of my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11024;Aah, yes, the cruelty of war. Carry on, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_cat;Was that an arrow?! KITTEN, NO!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_dog;Noooo! My dog! You were too good for this world...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_eagle;Arrows!!! Nooo! My trusted companion, where are you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_falcons;Is that a falcon?! What a strange sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_fallback;I... What happened? I don't belong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_horse;[Root.GetWarhorseName], no! Your sacrifice will not be forgotten...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_owl;Nooo! My trusted companion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_cat;Your cat is added to the list of casualties.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_dog;Your dog takes an arrow for you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_eagle;Your eagle dies in battle.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_falcons;The bird probably saved your life.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_fallback;You will struggle in the future to overcome these events...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_horse;Your horse dies in battle.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11025_TT_owl;Your owl is added to the list of casualties.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11026;I'll take that blade and send you back to [enemy_liege.Religion.GetHighGodName] with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11027;Tell your ancestors, that I foresaw your demise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11028;Haha! I will mount your head on my [Root.GetCapitalHolding] walls!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11029;I think a reward is in order!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11030;I aim to please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11031;Ssschblrrggh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11031_TT;§Y[home_commander.GetTitledFirstName]§! has an §YEnemy Skull§! added to [home_commander.GetHerHis] §YTreasury§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11032;And you just left [enemy_commander.GetHerHim] in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11032_same_society;Aaargh! I will personally take care of that brute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11033;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11034;Let's do something about this rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11034_TT;You get to work.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11035;Finally! Let's do something about this rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11036;[my_fellow_commander.GetSheHeCap] is a one-[my_fellow_commander.GetManWoman] army...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11037_1;I'll make you proud, [target.GetRootRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11037_2;Charge, in the name of [target.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_cannibal;This almost making me hungry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_default;I have found my purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_depressed;I feel *alive*!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_evil;Aaah, the sound of bone and resolve cracking before me... Invigorating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_kind;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] care for all these souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_lunatic;Come out, come out, where you are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11038_zealous;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], accept my blood tribute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_cannibal;Just working up my appetite, [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_default;Oh, you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_depressed;Haha, of course! Aaah, this is so invigorating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_evil;Nothing like the smell of bloodshed in the morning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_kind;You do me too much honor, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_lunatic;Come and get them! *cackle*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11039_zealous;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with me, [From.GetBrotherSister]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11040_1;[commander_to_the_rescue.GetSheHeCap] *stole* my prey...?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11040_2;Oh my, how chivalrous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11040_TT;§Y[commander_to_the_rescue.GetTitledFirstName]§! did well in the duel.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11041;How curious...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11042;W-wait, I surrender! Take me captive instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11043;They will all learn to fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11043_TT;§Y[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]§! was killed.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11049;We must remember to tend to our wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_11050;Aah, how lovely! I shall duel the Commander myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_11002;I will avenge you, my dear [home_commander.GetRootRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11012;Why does my head hurt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11012_tt;You gingerly pull the spear from your cheek. It is more than a grazing wound...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11013;You're right! Modesty will get me nowhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11014;They are simply becoming more confident in themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11016;Nonsense. We need any resource available to us, here at the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11019_1;I need to feel ALIVE again. Come here, servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11019_2;Some solitude, that's all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11020;I want to be more direct, I think. Yes, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11021;Turtle formation, like we practiced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11021_nomad;Eagle formation, like we practiced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11022;I will focus on flanking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11024;What is the meaning of this? I do not approve of this conduct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11025;Where is the enemy commander?! I'll kill [enemy_commander.GetHerHim] myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11025_TT;You chase down the §Y[enemy_commander.GetTitledFirstName]§! for a personal duel, while your soldiers tend to your wounded animal.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11026;I am not here for the discarded junk of my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11026_TT;You rely on your own weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11027;You can call me the Great [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimalCap]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11028;Rest now, [enemy_commander.GetBrotherSister].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11029;My [home_commander.GetRootRelation] has my gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11033;Even though I left [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] skull in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11034;Hey, [my_fellow_commander.GetTitledFirstName]. Get yourself over here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11034_TT;You let your fellow commander deal with the road block.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11036;Pssh, what a show-off! It's not that hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11037_1;You're saying *I* am the reason you became a soldier...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11037_2;Now they all look to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11040_1;I guess my [commander_to_the_rescue.GetRootRelation] was trying to impress me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11040_2;I hope [commander_to_the_rescue.GetSheHe] did not hurt [commander_to_the_rescue.GetHerselfHimself]...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11040_TT;§Y[commander_to_the_rescue.GetTitledFirstName]§! did poorly in the duel.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11041_1;Fortune does not always favor loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11041_2;Fortune does not always favor the brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11042;Take [commander_cannon_fodder.GetTitledFirstName] instead...! I'll help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11049;There is no time to take *breaks*! For [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], chaaarge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_11050;Waiting for me, [enemy_commander.GetManWoman]? Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_11014;Strategy is truly an art form in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11019_1;It should have been me, not their brave [Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11019_1_TT;You find a way to stop the feelings of guilt, permanently.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11019_2;Some people are always going to want me dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11020;I want to carry out the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11021;You know what we have, that they don't? Each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11022;I will dedicate myself to mastering narrow battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11024;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s right, we should terrorize our enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11027;The one who will paint the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain] with your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11037_1;You're never gonna let that story go, eh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11037_2;Have you heard the one about [target.GetFirstName] and the horse...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11040_1;What a waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11040_2;Why do such a foolish thing, [commander_to_the_rescue.GetBrotherSister]...?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11040_3;Oh no! My dear [commander_to_the_rescue.GetRootRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11040_TT;§Y[commander_to_the_rescue.GetTitledFirstName]§! died defending you...!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11042;So this is how it all ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11046;I think I prefer you dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_11050;There you are! I have been itching for a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_HFP_11019;I will go out hunting with my brethren, I think. Fresh air, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_HFP_11027;I am your worst nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF_HFP_11019;I shall never be close to anyone again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_HFP_11027;I am diplomat, of sorts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG_HFP_11027;I am doing you a kindness, believe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_HFP_11027_TT;*stab*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HFP_11019;Enough of these "feelings"! By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I'll punch someone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11020;I will never surrender a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11021;Follow your gut! Or mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11022;Siege tactics! Why have I not thought of this before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11027;Someone who will not rest until each and every one of you are dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HFP_11050;I will let everyone know of [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTH_HFP_11027;The one to grant you peace. Eternal peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_HFP_11027;In this case, I am your executioner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_HFP_11027;I am the one who decides what happens next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_HFP_11027;I am the fist that will crush you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_HFP_11027;I am but a shield, protecting my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_HFP_11027;I am the tower of justice, at the end of your road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTN_HFP_11027;I am the wall that will not give way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTO_HFP_11027;I am the [Root.GetManWoman] you all expected to beat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTP_HFP_11027;I am the one commanding the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQ_HFP_11027;I am the one who was born in the [battlefield_location.GetGroundDesc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTR_HFP_11027;I am the [Root.GetLordLady] of the [battlefield_location.GetTerrain]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTS_HFP_11027;You can call me [Root.GetLordLady] [battlefield_location.GetGroundDescCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_400;I truly enjoy a good duel. There is nothing I desire more than to challenge and win against the greatest fighters of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], except perhaps winning glory in personal combat against my enemies... Perhaps I should dedicate my life to this pursuit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_401;After having studied the strategies of both my own side, as well as those of my enemies, I feel confident that I have gathered enough knowledge to truly consider myself a battlefield strategist. I feel compelled to spend my life doing this, but is it a worthy pastime for a [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_402;No matter the weapon: sword, axe, mace or spear – I am unmatched in a duel. Many have tried to best me, and few have ever succeeded. My reputation reaches both far and wide – I am known for my skill, my tenacity, my cunning and my ruthlessness... Come the day, I would even defeat [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] in personal combat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_400;I shall become the greatest duelist [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has ever known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_401;It is a noble pursuit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_402;Bring it on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_400;No, I have a realm to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_401;No, I have a realm to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
