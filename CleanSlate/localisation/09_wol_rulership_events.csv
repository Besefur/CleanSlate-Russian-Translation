EVTDESC_WoL_12001;An architect has been brought before your court with a proposal. With your blessing, he will oversee the construction of a new castle in [target_province.GetName]. The castle design he suggests is novel - it will require less effort and resources to build, and yet without sacrificing the potency of its defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12002;An architect has been brought before your court, proposing the construction of a new castle in [target_province.GetName] for less resources than such a massive project would normally require. Before you can give him an answer, [Root.job_treasurer.GetFullName], your [Root.GetTreasurerName], whispers in your ear: 'This charlatan is known to me. He cannot be trusted.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12003;An architect has been brought before your court, proposing the construction of a new castle in [target_province.GetName] for less resources than such a massive project would normally require. Before you can give him an answer, [Root.job_treasurer.GetFullName], your [Root.GetTreasurerName], whispers in your ear: 'I know of this man - I believe we can trust him.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12004;Your guards caught the architect hired to build your castle in [target_province.GetName] trying to abscond with the gold you gave him. The wretch spent much of it on spirits and women, but the rest have been returned to your coffers. It looks as though there will be no castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12005;The construction of your new castle in [target_province.GetName] has been hampered by delays and material shortages. It looks as though the architect's initial estimates of the building costs were somewhat... optimistic. More funds will be required if the castle is to be finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12006;The castle you commissioned in [target_province.GetName] has been finished, and its construction required even less resources than originally planned! The surplus building material has been sold, and the gold placed in your coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12007;The castle you commissioned in [target_province.GetName] has been finished, more or less on schedule, and it appears to be of sturdy construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12008;The castle you commissioned in [target_province.GetName] has finally been finished, and despite the setbacks it appears to be of sturdy construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12009;There are no longer any suitable locations for the new castle you had commissioned, and the work has been abandoned. Fortunately, most of the funds had not yet been spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12010;Another day at court, and another endless procession of matters that you are required to pass judgment on. As yet another peasant drones on about his sickly pigs and the neighbor he believes poisoned them, you feel a profound emptiness. This isn't the life you had imagined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12011;No matter how many issues you deal with, there are always more demanding your attention. As the cacophony of quarreling nobles echoes throughout your court, you suddenly snap and push your way through the bewildered crowds to reach the exit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12015;A peasant accused of murder is dragged before your court. His wife and children were found butchered in the small hut they called home, and he was standing nearby, covered in their blood. Despite this damning evidence, the man continues to profess his innocence. What should be done with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12016;Your guards inform you that yet another peasant family has been found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place. This time the killer was caught in the act, and he was perforated by arrows when he tried to escape your guardsmen. It would seem the peasant you had hanged was innocent after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12017;Your guards inform you that yet another peasant family has been found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place. This time the peasant you set free was caught in the act, and he was perforated by arrows when he tried to escape your guardsmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12018;The peasant admitted his guilt under torture. Unfortunately, he expired in the process, so you may never know what compelled such a beast to murder his own family. Oh well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12019;Despite the torture, the peasant stubbornly refused to admit his guilt. Unfortunately, he expired in the process, but surely it was only a matter of time before he would have told us the truth of his crime...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12020;Yet another peasant family was found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place, but this time the killer was caught in the act. He was killed by your guardsmen while trying to escape, and the body they hauled back does decidedly not belong to the dead peasant who expired in your torture chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12021;Your guards inform you that yet another peasant family has been found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place. This time the killer was caught in the act, and he was perforated by arrows when he tried to escape your guardsmen. It would seem the peasant you had imprisoned was innocent after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12022;Your guards inform you that yet another peasant family has been found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place. This time the killer was caught in the act, and he was perforated by arrows when he tried to escape your guardsmen. It would seem the peasant you had imprisoned was innocent after all. Unfortunately he perished in your dungeons months ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12026;The feuding between [feuding_noble_1.GetBestName] and [feuding_noble_2.GetBestName] has reached your court, and can no longer be ignored. As your vassals, both have brought their grievances against each other to you in the hope of garnering your support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12027;A party of soldiers flying the banner of [farm_fire_noble.GetBestName] recently set up camp in the middle of a field belonging to a farmer in [Root.Capital.GetName]. According to the farmer, their camp fire spread out of control and his entire crop was reduced to ashes. He has brought the matter before your court and demands compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12028;A woman accused of witchcraft in [witch_province.GetName] has been dragged before your court. Several witnesses have seen her performing dark rituals in her secluded hut, possibly related to recent crop failures. She claims innocence, and it falls on you to determine her fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12029;Several tavern owners in [drunken_rampage.GetName] have come forward to your court with complaints against [noble_drunkard.GetBestName]. Apparently, [noble_drunkard.GetSheHe] has gone on drunken rampages in all of their establishments, and they are demanding compensation. [noble_drunkard.GetTitledFirstName] claims to have no memory of the nights in question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12031;During a visit to [mayor_city.GetName], [brigands_noble.GetBestName] and [brigands_noble.GetHerHis] entourage were accosted by brigands who made off with several valuables. Efforts to catch the thieves have failed, and [brigands_noble.GetTitledFirstName] is now demanding compensation from [brigands_mayor.GetBestName]. The matter has been brought for arbitration at your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12501;Your understanding of all matters pertaining to rulership and administration has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12502;Recent events have increased your grasp of stewardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12503;Ruling from your court has increased your sense of justice. Your judgments have a profound effect on the lives of your subjects, and you have decided to be more fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12504;As more and more people seek audience at your court, you have come to realize that there is much to do when it comes to the administration of the realm. You must work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12505;You are no longer content to rest on your laurels. The problems facing your realm are legion, and clearly no one can fix them but you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12506;Whether it is deserved or not, your decisions at court have earned you a reputation of being incredibly wise. People journey from far away to seek your advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12507;Your vassals have come to respect your rulership, even if they do not always agree with your decisions. No one questions that you have what it takes to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_12001;Build the castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12004;To the dungeons with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12005;Confound it all! Give them the gold they need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12007;Not bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12008;About time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12009;Ah, that's right... they were building a castle there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12010;By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName], will you shut up about your pigs?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12011;I can't take this anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12015;This animal must be hanged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12016;Perhaps my verdict was a bit... hasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12017;It was probably a bad idea to set him loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12018;Justice has been served. Probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12019;Yes... yes, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12020;Well... fancy that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12021;Well, don't just stand there! Set him free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12022;Well, how was I to know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12026;[feuding_noble_1.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12027;[farm_fire_noble.GetTitledFirstName] is to compensate the farmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12028;She will burn at the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12029;[noble_drunkard.GetTitledFirstName] shall compensate the tavern owners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12031;It seems fair. [brigands_mayor.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for what was lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_12001;No, we have no need of his services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12005;Abandon construction... let us save what we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12015;Toss him into the dungeons and leave him there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12026;[feuding_noble_2.GetTitledFirstName] has my support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12027;The fire was a divine act. No one is responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12028;Throw the fiend in the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12029;Drinking and debauchery are what your taverns are for, are they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12031;[brigands_mayor.GetTitledFirstName] can hardly be held responsible for this theft!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_WoL_12015;The evidence is circumstantial. Let him go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12026;Both are acting like quarreling children!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12027;I shall pay the farmer out of my own coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12028;What nonsense is this? Release the poor woman at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12029;Sigh... I will pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12031;I will personally compensate [brigands_noble.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_WoL_12015;Perhaps some torture will loosen his tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
