EVTDESC_ZE_10031;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nMy men and I have had trouble finding a battlefield where our expertise could be employed for payment in gold, and unfortunately our rations are now running low. I therefore request additional funding to keep the men from starving.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_10033;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nThe money you sent was well needed. However we had to spend the whole lot of it on food. We could need some better equipment to have better chances of success once we reach the battlefield. Equipment is rather expensive for our empty purse and I know that you will see the benefit of such an investment.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_10071;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWar is a harsh business and the soldiers are demanding more money. I have no regrets informing you that this money will come from your cut, since it's the people fighting that are doing all the work and not the people sitting on high chairs.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_10076;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nMy men and I have put up with your leeching of our abilities for too long now. You failed to treat us with the proper respect on multiple occasions and therefore we will from now on pay no respect or allegiance towards you. It will be my pleasure to aid your enemies to defeat your armies on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_10031;I'll cover the cost for extra rations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_10033;I'll send a contribution at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_10071;Of course the men should be rewarded generously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_10076;That ungrateful [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_10031;Starvation might serve as a lesson to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_10033;I can't spare you a single coin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_10071;Let them keep a little of the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_10033;Remind [From.GetFirstName] of [From.GetHerHis] obligations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_10071;I need to remind [From.GetTitledFirstName] that this would be a breach of contract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
