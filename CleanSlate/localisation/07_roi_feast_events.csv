EVTDESC_RoI_1000;To properly celebrate the seasonal feast, you should invite all your vassals. You have your scribe write the letters and send them off, the messengers' satchels decorated with flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1001;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend my celebration of the feast of Diwali.\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1002;Your vassal, [From.GetFullName], has refused your invitation to the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1005;In the Indian autumn feasts, tradition dictates that you offer a gift to your spouse. You should plan for this and buy something before the feast begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1006;In accordance with tradition, you may offer a gift to your lover during the autumn feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1007;At the feast, it's time for the traditional ceremony of gifts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1020;The castle is decorated with flowers and colorful tapestries, carpets and ribbons. All the guests have arrived, there is a bustle of people all eager and full of festive spirit. It's time for the feast to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1050;A snake charmer is entertaining the guests at the feast. He plays a flute and sings in odd tones to various poisonous snakes that he has brought in a basket. The audience is held captivated by his skills as he seemingly controls the snakes with his voice and his music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1051;There is a silence among the revellers as the snake charmer works his magic with the snakes. But suddenly you hear a high shriek, and the snake charmer looks confused - it seems a large cobra has broken free and is slithering across the floor towards the guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1052;The escaped cobra disappears under the table. There are a few moments of silence, and then a shrill shriek. The cobra has slithered up into the lap of one of the guests, scaring the person half to death! The snake, then quickly disappears out through an open window.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1053;A snake charmer is entertaining the guests at the feast. He plays a flute and sings in odd tones to various poisonous snakes that he has brought in a basket. Then, suddenly you feel something cold and slithery moving in your lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1054;The escaped cobra disappears under the table. There are a few moments of silence, and then a terrified scream. One of the guests is shaking in violent convulsions, with people nearby staring in shock as they realize the snake has bitten their neighbor. As the snake disappears out through an open window, the victim stops shaking and lies still, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1055;The escaped cobra slithers across the floor. The guests at the table seem paralyzed, except for one person who quickly draws his sword and steps forward, chopping the animal in half with a swift cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1056;A snake charmer is entertaining the guests at the feast, until suddenly a cobra escapes! You quickly draw your sword and step forward, chopping the animal in half with a swift cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1060;That person over there has been looking at you in a funny way during the entire feast. Laughing, thinking evil thoughts about you. You have tried putting goat's cheese in your hair to ward it off, but still his scheming ways threaten you. He wants to take your gold. And your undergarments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1061;The voices in your head have spoken. The pressure rises, you must see blood flow tonight or you will go insane. Anyone at the table of the feast will do - ah, that one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1062;A fellow guest at the feast, mindless of his manners, has repeatedly turned his back on you and now he spilled sauce on your garments. You are certain it was on purpose - or at least you're not certain it wasn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1063;You are enjoying a fantastic show of dancers at the feast. Suddenly, a fellow reveller accidentally bumps into you, knocking your drink out of your hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1064;That man who has been staring at you several times during the feast is surely plotting to murder you. Better to fight him here in the open than him sticking a knife in your back later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1065;What a great feast! You have been drinking heavily for several days, only pausing to sleep (but not much). You are wandering around the grounds, not exactly sure where you are. You excuse yourself to people as you bump into them.\n\nYou have the servants fetch you another drink. What day is it? It seems you are wearing someone else's clothes. How funny! Someone tells you to calm down, how annoying. Someone else wants their clothes back, now they're shouting and threatening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1066;A fellow guest at the feast, clearly out of his mind, has challenged you to a duel. It seems to you there is no good reason, and duels can be very dangerous, but backing down might still make you look weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1067;Your intended opponent refuses to duel with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1068;Tension runs high at the feast. [From.GetTitledName] has challenged [FromFrom.GetTitledName]to a duel, but the latter chose to back down, doing some injury to his prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1069;The guests at the feast gather around to see the duel between you and [FromFrom.GetFullName]. As the challenged party, you have the right to choose which weapon shall be used in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1070;[From.GetFullName] has accepted your challenge and there will be a duel. As the challenged party, your opponent may choose what weapons will be used and he has chosen swords. The other guests at the feast gather around to see you fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1071;[From.GetFullName] has accepted your challenge and there will be a duel. As the challenged party, your opponent may choose what weapons will be used and he has chosen daggers. The other guests at the feast gather around to see you fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1072;[From.GetFullName] has accepted your challenge and there will be a duel. As the challenged party, your opponent may choose what weapons will be used and he has chosen spears. The other guests at the feast gather around to see you fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1073;The duel is about to start. But first, there is one thing that remains for you to decide: will you fight honorably or fight dirty? The latter choice will obviously increase your chances, but there is a large crowd watching and they will see everything that happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1075;The duel commences. You begin to circle around each other, both of you observing the other closely and feinting to try and gauge the skill of the opponent. Then suddenly, steel flashes and there is a flurry of attacks and counterattacks. Gasps of terror and of delight are heard from the audience, mixing with the curses and grunts from the duelists and the sound of clashing steel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1080;Tempers flaring at the feast! A duel broke out between [FromFromFrom.GetFullName] and [FromFrom.GetFullName], and the ringing of steel on steel held the spectators captive for several intense moments.\n\n[FromFrom.GetFullName] lost but he suffered only minor wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RoI_1140;During the feast, you are entertained by dancers. One of the female dancers especially catches your attention. She moves with near divine grace and allure, and you feel strangely attracted to her. You come to think of the mysterious and beautiful Apsara of legend, shapechanging dancers descending from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1141;You call the dancer over after the dance has finished, and she comes and sits down next to you. You talk of the body, pleasure and beauty. She sits very close to you, speaking with a soft and seductive voice. You begin to feel strangely warm and light-headed. It feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1142;As you wake, your mind is filled with memories of a wonderful night of pleasure. You look around, but the dancer is gone without a trace. It was truly something extraordinary, and your mind wanders to old tales told by priests and storytellers - was she really a human woman, or could it be that you have met one of the beautiful Apsara of legend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1143;At one point during the feast, a male singer performs. His voice is captivating and sensual, notes dancing across the room and tickling your skin with an almost physical touch. You are completely captivated by his charisma - he reminds you of the mysterious and beautiful Gandharvas of legend, singer spirits of the sky making music for the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1144;You call the singer over after the performance has finished, and he comes and sits down next to you. You talk of music, the body, pleasure and beauty. He sits very close to you, speaking with a soft and seductive voice. You begin to feel strangely warm and light-headed. It feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1145;As you wake, your mind is filled with memories of a wonderful night of pleasure. You look around, but the singer is gone without a trace. A small bird flies by outside the window, singing beautifully. Your mind wanders to old tales told by priests and storytellers - was he really a human man, or could it be that you have met one of the beautiful Gandharva of legend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1151;There is a murmur among the guests of the feast, as a mage enters to entertain you. With great flourish, he explains that the coming show will astound even the most cyncial spectator. He proceeds to put a small boy into a basket on the floor, wherafter he swiftly chops the basket into little pieces with a sword. When he removes the shreds of the basket, there is no sign of the boy, no blood, nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1152;There is a murmur among the guests of the feast, as a mage enters to entertain you. With great flourish, he places three cups before you on the table. He places a ball under one cup, and then tells you to observe closely and tell you where the ball is after he finishes moving the cups. He then shifts the cups around with lightning speed, all the while prattling on and telling you to pay attention. He then asks you to pick a cup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1153;The magician looks at you with a knowing and superior smile as he reveals the ball. It seems you chose the wrong cup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1154;There is a murmur among the guests of the feast, as a mage enters to entertain you. With great flourish, he explains that you are about to see something amazing. He takes out a rope and starts playing a flute. The rope starts dancing by itself and rises up towards the ceiling. The magician beckons, and a small boy appears and starts climbing the rope. The audience gasps. After a minute, the boy climbs down, the magician stops playing and the rope falls down again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1160;You are sitting at the table during the feast, enjoying the food and drink. Suddenly, you hear a wild chattering and screaming. A group of small monkeys have entered through an open window, and they quickly spread in the hall, causing chaos! They pull people's hair and clothes, steal food, spill wine, drink wine and defecate on the tables. The feast hall is in uproar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1171;The darkest night of the Diwali is here, the most important night of the feast. Candles and lamps are lit everywhere, the guests stroll across the painted and decorated floor, wearing colorful dress. Rich and sweet food is served, and the drink is also plentiful. Rama and Lakshi are honored, celebrating the victory of light over darkness, good over evil and hope over despair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RoI_1177;The darkest night of the Kali Puja is here, the most important night of the feast. Candles are lit everywhere, placed inside human skulls. The guests stroll across the painted and decorated floor, carrying various symbols of time, death and change. Homage is offered to the beautiful and terrifying four-armed idols with swords, skulls and severed heads in their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1178;Kali is our Mother, the Goddess of Time, Death and the Darkest Night. She must be honored properly, and you have just the right thing in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1179;[target_prisoner.GetFullName] screams as [target_prisoner.GetSheHe] is dragged before the great idol of Kali. As temple servants hold [target_prisoner.GetHerHim] down, a priest pulls out a long kris and then stabs [target_prisoner.GetHerHim] right through the heart. Then [target_prisoner.GetHerHis] throat is cut and the blood is slowly collected in bowls made of a human skulls and passed around for the guests to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1181;The servant screams as he is seized by the guards and then dragged before the great idol of Kali.

Then his throat is cut and the blood is slowly collected in bowls made of a human skulls and passed around for the guests to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1183;A large elephant is led into the hall. It is tied down with strong ropes and chains, and then stabbed with swords, screaming and trumpeting terribly for several minutes as it dies. The guests watch in horrified fascination. The process is then repeated with nine more elephants - a long, bloody cacophonic concert of death. At the end of it, the floor is a lake of blood. Several priests step forth, sliding and slipping in the gore, holding long brushes. They dip the brushes in the blood and start painting the walls, eventually covering them entirely in this gruesome, wet and dark paint. The smell is strong and sickening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1188;Several black goats are brought forth by the priests. The goats are laid down below a large statue of Kali, and their throats are cut open. The blood is collected in bowls made of human skulls and presented to the crowd. A chanting arises, then a cheer, as the holy sacrifice to the Goddess of Death, Time and of the Blackest Night has been made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1940;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend my celebration of the feast of Kali Puja.\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1996;The feast is over, but it was a fantastic feast. As the guests make their way home you sit down and smile to yourself, pleased at how things turned out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1997;The feast is over, but it didn't quite turn out as you had hoped. As the guests make their way home, you sit down and ponder what went wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_1998;The feast is over, but it was a fantastic feast. As you make your way home, you think that you'd probably come back next year again if invited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
