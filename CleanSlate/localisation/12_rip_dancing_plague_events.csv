EVTDESC_RIP_4001;Something very strange is happening in the county of [dancing_plague_outbreak_location.GetName]. It all started with one peasant dancing in the streets, but soon there were dozens of them, and now there are hundreds - men, women and children alike! Musicians are playing joyous tunes all day and all night and the peasants barely have time to eat or sleep. The dancing has gone on for days and people have started to collapse from exhaustion.\n\nIt seems as if the dancing is spreading at an alarming rate, with groups of dancing people setting off in the direction of other towns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4002;After enjoying a hearty meal you look out the window at the dancing peasants. The music is tantalizingly inviting, and you have felt a bit restless as of late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4003;Right as you are about to leave, your court physician grabs hold of your arm. [target_physician.GetFirstName] tells you that it is not a good idea to join the dance, lest you too should collapse from exhaustion! Instead [target_physician.GetSheHe] recommends that you rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4004;You spend hours dancing with the peasants, and they are clearly impressed! They would never have expected their [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] to join in their revelry. This is a moment they will remember for years to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4006;Months have passed since you first joined the dance. The dancing peasants have dropped like flies around you, from exhaustion, starvation or broken bones. Suddenly your feet stop moving and your arms stop flailing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4007;It never ceases! Where at first you were able to take breaks to eat and sleep, you now cannot do even that! Your legs will not let you rest, your arms will not let you hold food and your mind will not let you focus on anything but the music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4008;After several days of continuous dancing the strain in your legs is becoming unbearable. Suddenly something snaps! You fall to the ground, unable to take another step. It looks as if your dancing days are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_RIP_4005;While it was pleasant to dance with the peasants at first, it has quickly become tiring. You have no desire to stop though, and when your servants plead for you to return back home for dinner you choose to ignore them. You simply MUST dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_RIP_4005;You lie down to rest but are unable to fall asleep. All you can think of is the music and the dancing... oh, how enjoyable it would be to join them out on the streets! After a while you feel yourself unable to resist the urge and bolt outside to join the peasants in their revelry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_RIP_4001;The Dancing Plague;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RIP_4001;This is truly an unprecedented situation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4002;Perhaps I should join in their joyous cavorting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4003;Oh well, if you say so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4004;I have never had this much fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4005;I will dance forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4006;Finally, [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] no longer controls my arms and legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4007;Do not stop me now, I am having such a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RIP_4008;Aaargh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RIP_4002;No, I should get some rest instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RIP_4003;No! I must dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
