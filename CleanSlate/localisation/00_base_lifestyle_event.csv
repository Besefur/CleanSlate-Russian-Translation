EVTDESC5000;A book without a title was pushed into my hands by a hooded man clad in midnight blue. Something was said, but was lost in the confusion. The book was still there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5001;The book is gibberish, but also enlightening. But, even if I struggle with some chapters, its mystery still engrosses me. Something is concealed in the book's language and I am determined to find out what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5002;The 'secret' within the book still eluded me after several weeks of intense study, wasted time and wasted ink! The man couldn't be anything but a maniac, filling precious parchment with malarkey and incomprehensible symbols.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5003;It took me several weeks before the mystery of the book revealed itself to me. The gibberish parts were encoded and after many hours trying to decipher the code, I managed to break it and construct a key to make the book easier to read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5020;A rather nettlesome neighbor keeps sending me envoys begging for money or demanding tribute. I feel rather confused about his arbitrary ways and I am not sure what I should do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5021;My nettlesome neighbor has been rather quiet since I sent him his envoys back with their hats nailed to their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5022;A letter arrived from my nettlesome neighbor not many days after the astonished envoys returned home. He was most grateful and deeply touched by the red roses I sent him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5023;'Atone for thy sins!'\n\nMy subjects do not like the new impaling punishment and, led by the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s, show their umbrage by throwing rotten vegetables at me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5024;The respect and prestige I got after nailing the hats to the envoys' heads has whetted my appetite. I have sent for a skilled torturer who will teach me more about torture and impalement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5025;My garden is the apple of my eye, my pride and joy. I distrust my gardener and would spend every hour of the day in my garden if I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5026;My subjects does not like the new impaling punishment and, led by the imams, show their umbrage by throwing rotten vegetables at me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5030;My eager courtship of a certain lady has gotten me nowhere, her icy response can cool even the warmest heart. I will not give up, there must be something I can do to win her affection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5031;My attempts to make her mine have been to no avail. She is as frosty as the lord of winter himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5032;I struggled with the poem for several days and with a trembling heart, I sent it to her. Her response was warm and lovely, it seemed the ice princess finally has thawed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5033;I did not tell my heart's desire about my decision to perform heroic deeds of valor to win her heart but I started seeing her at every tournament, every duel I fought. She started smiling at me and laughed when I defeated my opponents in her name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5034;The largest, most prestigious tournament will take place in a county not far from here. The small victories I have won to make my special lady fall in love with me seem trivial now and I feel I have to win this so she will love me forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5035;For every poem I write and she receives, a bigger piece of her heart belongs to me. I have selected a couple of my and apparently her favorites and given to the monks to have them illustrated and written down properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5036;The prestigious tournament just ended, with me as the sole winner. I could hardly believe it as the lady of my heart kissed me chastely on my cheek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5037;I was mortified and then furious as the monk told me that they had liked my poetry so much they had produced several copies and sold them. The lady of my heart did not seem to care though, she just kissed me sweetly and thanked me but said she already got a copy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5040;My work tasks bore me, conversations with my courtiers bore me, everything bores me! I need something new and exciting in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5041;The hunt was a huge disappointment, no game in sight and my horse threw me off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5042;We started early, the sun had barely risen above the horizon. There was plenty of prey, the dogs caught many rabbits and I slew one great boar before he killed my horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5043;The new bird had not been properly trained, it attacked one of the dogs and had to be killed before it released its grip on the poor, wailing hound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5044;Rabbit after rabbit was caught, killed and brought to me by my new bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5045;I feel more relaxed now, I can do my tasks, talk to my courtiers and do other things without feeling too bored. Maybe I should hunt more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5046;The new bird is almost too perfect. I enjoy every hunt with her, and the cook has trouble finding new recipes for rabbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5047;We started early, when the sun had barely risen above the horizon. Game was plentiful, no hunter returned without a hare or fowl tied to their saddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5050;A new bird has arrived in the mews and a new book on the art of writing poetry is in the library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5051;This book about poetry is really boring. It is filled with do's and do not's and I just want to throw it out the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5052;The poetry book is really inspiring! I can feel creativity bursting through my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5053;The new bird was more aggressive than the ones I'm used to. It killed many rabbits but was unwilling to relinquish its catch - it even attacked me when I tried to pry one away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5055;My modest attempts to write poetry was never meant to be published in any way, but wherever I go, bards and minstrels are reciting or singing my poems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5060;The church preaches celibacy and my friends try to lure me into hedonism by showing me the pleasures of life. I can't really decide if I want to enjoy life or wait for heaven...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5061;A waste of money, a waste of time but oh so good it felt! The pleasures of life makes everything feel less tiresome and more... delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5062;The first few days felt manageable but then I started notice the other sex and felt envious of those who could indulge in sinful activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5063;Just thinking of celibacy makes me shiver but at the same time, something seem amiss in my life. What is this emptiness inside of me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5064;The temptations are everywhere! The inviting glances, the luscious bodies and the alluring fragrances...;;;;;;;;;;;;;xx
EVTDESC5065;After a long, long, long time it feels as if I could bear to live in complete celibacy for the rest of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5066;This lifestyle of utmost pleasure and joyous life suits me perfectly. This can be nothing but heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5070;The pleasures of life, or the pleasures of the after-life? Everything one longs for in this world, will be there in the Garden, Jannah. But life shouldn't be dull, without flavour or pleasures! This is a true dilemma...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5071;An abundance of food, wine and good company, the hedonism lifestyle seems to make me forget the grey world outside and I indulge in everything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5072;There's inspiration to get from everything, from the breakfast I devour to the sight of sunlight illuminating the flowers in my garden, from the works of Imru' al-Qais or The Story of Bayad and Riyad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5073;It is the most important decision in my life. I truly enjoy all the pleasure hedonism brings me and its rules, to only do what pleasures you the most, is one I gladly follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5074;The poetic lifestyle awaits me, if I truly believe it is the one lifestyle for me. I have learnt more about my people's traditions, life and culture by immersing myself in reading and writing poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5080;A faqih is an expert in 'fiqh' which is knowledge of legislative rulings, pertaining to the actions of man, as derived from their detailed evidences. I have been asked if I would like to study with some of the best fuqaha of [Root.Location.GetName] so that I may one day become one of the greatest jurists of the Islamic world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5081;A year of studying fiqh has left my poor head weary. The other faqihs are merciless in their demands, I am to study the Qur'an, the Sunnah, Ijma' (Consensus) and Qiyas (Analogy) to prepare myself for the last exam, then I may call myself a faqih.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5082;I have finally become an expert in Islamic jurisprudence! My knowledge of the Qur'an, the Sunnah, Ijma' (Consensus) and Qiyas (Analogy) is what makes me a faqih and I will use that knowledge to be a better [Root.GetTitle] and ruler of my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA5000;Hey... wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5001;The secret will soon be mine! Muhahaha... *cough* *cough*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5002;I learned to love books instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5003;The mystery is still not solved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5020;I will send him these roses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5021;Go me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5022;I told you so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5023;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5024;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5025;If I could, I would spend all my time in the garden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5026;Vegetables won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5030;Poetry could work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5031;Forget it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5032;Words can't describe my feelings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5033;Her heart has thawed for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5034;My best will not be enough, I must win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5035;I hope she will like it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5036;I love my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5037;I should be furious, but I am just happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5040;Some hunting will cheer me up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5041;Forget it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5042;This day has been great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5043;Now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5044;I like this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5045;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5046;I'm a falconer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5050;I should start reading the book;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5051;This wasn't for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5052;Give me a quill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5053;She is far too dangerous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5055;Fame and fortune awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5060;I can try some pleasures...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5061;Sweet temptation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5062;This is too hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5063;I need to take a few days contemplating this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5064;No! I will not give in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5065;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5066;More... more of everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5070;I live life in the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5071;...but I feel empty inside, there's no creativity in hedonism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5072;I have tired of this! Let me enjoy the pleasures of life instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5073;I am a hedonist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5074;I am a poet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5080;This is an opportunity I don't dare say 'no' to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5081;I cannot quit now, so close to becoming a faqih...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5082;I am proud to have become a faqih!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB5000;It wants me to read it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5001;The book's secret eludes me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5020;Nail the envoy's hats to their head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5021;Wonder what happens if I do like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5022;They finally came to good use;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5023;Maybe I should grow more roses?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5024;I'm having fun with it for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5025;I love my garden, but there are other things in life too;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5030;I will perform heroic deeds of valor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5031;I won't give up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5036;Can I stop doing this now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5037;This is too humiliating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5040;Perhaps I should send for a new bird...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5041;I should try falconry instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5043;I'll try hunting instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5045;I'm good for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5046;No more rabbit pie, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5050;I should take her out for a hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5051;I should take the bird out for some hunting instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5053;Poetry is safer, let's try that instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5055;My poetry was never meant for others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5060;I hope celibacy doesn't bore me too much;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5061;Stay strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5062;I will stay strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5063;Ignore it, live life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5064;Free! Free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5065;Maybe later;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5066;I should contemplate this some more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5070;Find true beauty and pleasure through poetry instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5071;This is the life for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5072;I have found my calling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5073;Hedonism is not a lifestyle I seek to pursue for ever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5074;Poetry is not a lifestyle I seek to pursue for ever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5080;It sounds like an awful lot of work... No, thank you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5081;I give up, this is not the life I want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5082;I will use the knowledge but not the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC5071;I have had enough, hedonism is not the lifestyle for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC5072;Poetry is nice, but perhaps I will find something better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
