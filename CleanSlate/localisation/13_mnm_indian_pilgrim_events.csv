EVTDESC_MNM_8000;I shall do a pilgrimage to one of the holy sites of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith seeking enlightenment and purification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8001;There are many places a devout [Root.Religion.GetName] might visit during a pilgrimage. They will undoubtedly all offer enlightenment but a closer location may make for a safer journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_8004;My preparations are done and the time has come to begin my pilgrimage to Sarnath. Soon I shall experience the tranquility and enlightenment of the park in which the Buddha held his first lectures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8005;My preparations are all done and it is now time to begin my pilgrimage for Bodh Gaya and the sacred Bodhi Tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8006;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to set out for Monasteries of Sanchi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8007;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to start my pilgrimage for Shravanabelagola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8008;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to start my pilgrimage for the ancient mountains of Girnar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8009;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to set out for the forest of Madhuban and the Shikarji peaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8010;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to set out for the land of Braj and the twin cities of Mathura and Vrindavan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8011;I have packed my things and made preparations for my household to make do without me. It is time to set out for the ancient city of Varanasi. Soon I shall cleanse my body in the Ganges as generations have before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8020;It is the season of the monsoon and rain is pouring down. Roads turn to mud and crops wash away. The life of a pilgrim can sometimes be a hard and arduous one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8021;The dry season is upon us and there is no water in sight. A pilgrim's life can sometimes harsh and unforgiving but it is clear this is taking a heavier toll on the villages I pass by than it does on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8022;Any traveller would balk at the prospect of traversing hills and jungle but it was the shorter route. Emerging from the undergrowth however it is becoming increasingly clear that I have made a mistake. The road ahead is not necessarily as dangerous as what now lies behind, but it is quite clearly not the right road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8023;A large group of mounted warriors block our way. The local Raja is a man that has taken it upon himself to relieve pilgrims, merchants or other travelers of some of their wealth in order to allow them passage. Turning back is not an option, either we pay or we will have to fight these men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8024;It has been days since we last saw a settlement and deep forests surround us on all sides. The small road we have been following has all but disappeared in the thick undergrowth. As I look up I can make out a huge creature native to this jungle on the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8025;Since this journey began I have come to pass through many cities and villages. Few have been as poor as the settlement that now lies before us. Men, women and children live in such poverty that it is hard to see how they can endure, and yet... These are some of the happiest people I have ever come across!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8026;A pilgrimage is as much an inner adventure as it is a journey through the physical realm. As my goal grows ever closer the people I meet and the places I see has made me reflect and re-evaluate things I thought I knew about life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8027;As we looked for a place to set up camp at the end of a long day we stumbled across a sentry. Having examined our group he decided that we are harmless pilgrims and bid us to enter the camp of his master, a rich vaishya merchant of the southern trade guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8028;Everything seems to taste foul today. Was it the local cuisine or that night spent camping in a swamp? It is hard to say for sure but something is not right with this pilgrim...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8029;You come across a thriving city in the middle of a dry upland. The secret of their prosperity seems to be huge water tanks, built and maintained by the local Raja. A separate reservoir is also under construction to allow the city to grow even bigger. You stop to admire this feat of engineering and cannot help wondering how much a similar construction could benefit [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8030;In the middle of a small village stands an unusually large pipal tree. The villagers have built a platform of grass and mud around its center, this is clearly a place for spiritual reflection and discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8031;After a trek of many days through unfamiliar lands I now stand before an unfamiliar but dazzingly splendid city. Houses of rich and poor alike are made of stone and on the central hilltop a citadel looks out over massive water reservoirs to keep the inhabitants supplied with water at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8034;Following an audience with the local Raja you spend the rest of the day exploring the city. Its central position along a major trade route attracts travelers from all over the region. Among the many travelers you meet a [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetManWoman] entirely after your own mind. Your meeting does not last long but as you part your new friend invites you to visit [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetHerHim] in [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetHerHis] native [home_of_new_friend.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8034_common_origin;Following an audience with the local Raja you spend the rest of the day exploring the city. Its central position along a major trade route attracts travelers from all over the region. Among the many travelers you unexpectedly meet an old acquaintance from home.  [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetName] is also on the road and you use this opportunity to get to know each other better. You find that [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetSheHe] is a [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetManWoman] entirely after your own mind and as you part you promise to see each other again in [home_of_new_friend.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8035;As I entered the city I was quickly invited to the citadel of the local Raja. Entering the audience chamber another visitor storms in demanding to know why I was given this right to enter before [new_enemy_far_away_from_home.GetHerHim]. The Raja manages to calm the situation somewhat but as [new_enemy_far_away_from_home.GetSheHe] leaves [new_enemy_far_away_from_home.GetSheHe] swears that I will pay for this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_8036;Spending time and money in a city is a good way to make new acquaintances. I cannot help however this has been a day wasted on my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8037;It has been months since I left my home behind. I cannot help but wonder how my house and family fares without me. Surely I arranged things as well as possible before I left however, who could I trust if not friends and family?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8050;A short journey from the holy city of Varanasi lies Sarnath. This is the park in which Buddha gave his first sermons, setting the wheel of the Dharma in motion, telling his followers of the four noble truths and founding the Sangha itself. Today the park is home to the imposing Dhamek Stupa and over a thousand priests and monks.\n\nThis is one of the most bustling centers of Buddhist teachings in India and one of the sites named by the Buddha himself as a worthy pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8051;You have finally arrived in Bodh Gaya, by many considered the seat of Buddhism. It was here that Buddha once sat under the tree of enlightenment, meditating on the mysteries of the universe. Over the centuries rulers and influentials both in India and further away have contributed to a great number of temples, monasteries and shrines at this post. To this day the monks of Bodh Gaya has kept a giant Bodhi Tree alive here, a huge pipal right next to the 'Diamond Throne' that a ruler of another age built to commemorate the event.\n\nAs you approach the blue tiled walls of the massive Mahabodhi temple you reflect on how different this site must be from when Buddha himself came here. At that point he was not unlike yourself, a simple ascetic seeking enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8052;You have finally arrived in Sanchi, one of the oldest centers of Buddhist worship in the world. Legend has it the original Stupa here was constructed by Emperor Ashoka at the insistence of his Vidishan queen Devi. Ever since Buddhists have been coming here to seek out the serenely secluded environment, and over hundreds of years more temples, stupas and monasteries have sprung up in this ideal place for monastic life.\n\nAs you approach the elaborate Torana of the ancient Great Stupa of Ashoka you reflect on the generations of faithful that have walked this way before you as well as on the fate of Sariputra and Mahamoggalana whose relics lie within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8053;You have finally arrived in Shravanabelagola, the white pond of the Shravana. For centuries great monks and Sravakas have meditated here on the hills of Chandragiri and Vindhyagiri, among them even great kings and emperors. As you approach the main pond you reflect on the faith of Bahubali whose atonement for his sins and sublimation into godhood is commemorated here by a 57 feet statue in his likeness. Shravanabelagola is the site of many Jain mathas and temples and is the site where some of the holiest scriptures are kept.\n\nFortunately you have arrived in time for the Mahamastakabhisheka ceremony and get to watch as the statue of Bahubali is bathed and anointed and sprinkled with powders of Sandalwood and Vermilion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8054;You have arrived in the temple district of Taleti at the foot of Girnar. A long set of stairs will take you up the sacred mountain to see the shrines and temples. It was here that Krishna was once confined by his mother and where he tricked Kalayavana to meet the inflaming ire of the sleeping Muchukunda.\n\nAs you reach the Bhavnat shrine you observe the hundreds of naked Sadhus making their offerings to Shiva and bathing themselves in the tank of the temple. The entire place is resounding with sounds and music and according to some Shiva himself is near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8055;Having crossed the Madhuban forest, you have finally reached the foot of the Parasnath hills and the pilgrimage of Shikarji. On these mountain peaks 20 out of the 24 tirthankaras achieved moksha through meditation making this one of the holiest of places in the world. Their ascent to Nirvana has left a permanent mark on this place, and during your climb upwards to the sacred peaks you pass the small marble tonks left to commemorate each and every one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8056;You have finally arrived at the heart of Braj, in Mathura, the place where lord Krishna was once born. It is said the first temple constructed at this ancient site was built by Vajranabha, the great-grandson of Krishna himself. Since then the devoted have travelled to this place to give their offerings and see this most holy of Hindu places. Today thousands of pilgrims come here, and to the nearby Vrindavan where Krishna spent his youth, every year to circumambulate Govardhana and the other temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8057;At the confluence of the Varuna and the Assi lies one of the oldest cities of India. Known by names such as Varanasi, Kasi or Banaras this is also one of the holiest places in the world. For thousands of years pilgrims have visited the hundreds of temples and the many ghats that lead into the holy river Ganges. They have sought enlightenment and purification or in some cases, to die in this place where salvation is guaranteed.\n\nEager to perform your own cleansing you approach the Dashashwamedh Ghats, a set of stairs said to have been created to welcome Shiva by lord Brahma millennia ago, you reflect on Ganges, Krishna and the cycle of rebirth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8061;This place is invigorating to the mind. Being able to engage with so many great minds of religion and theology has stimulated my understanding and willingness to explore the finer points of the faith. Hours and even days are lost in conversation with Sadhus, Priests and Monks about the deeper meaning of various passages in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8062;Purification and Enlightenment have never before felt as tangible as in this place. Pilgrims are circumambulating shrines, sadhus are conveying their blessings upon the faithful and monks and gurus meditate together. I join those in worship that for thousands of years have attended this place and others like it. This is a profound experience unlike anything I have ever felt before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8063;Many pilgrims have stories of the experiences from their journeys and the great enlightenment or purification achieved in at the destination. I expected much more than I have found here. The place is certainly full of monks, sadhus, priests and holy men but neither circumambulation, meditation or cleansing has left me with anything but an empty feeling of doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8064;Eager to engage other in discussion I rushed right ahead to the centers of learning. I can tell the ideas and thoughts I have had over the years have made an impression on others here. Even great minds, scholars and sadhus alike seem taken by my reasoning and my home-grown theological arguments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8065;There are people here from every corner of the world. Though we are united in reverence of this holy place their languages, clothes and even the people themselves seem exotic and different. Meeting and conversing with strangers is in itself an experience that will impact me more than the religious aspects of this pilgrimage itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8066;A pilgrimage can be undertaken for many reasons. For some it is a way to atone for past sins, for others a way to repay the universe for what they have. To many the pilgrimage is a great and rejuvenating journey. I feel convinced this is so, for my journey has left me invigorated in a way I have never experienced before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8067;Like me many others have come here to seek the spiritual experience of their life. To some this is draining but I find it to be quite invigorating. With the appetite of the mind sated perhaps it is time to enjoy myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8068;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. After completing my cleansing bath in the Ganges and started to climb back up the ghats I met an old wrinkled man who bestowed his blessing upon me. Ever since I have felt more powerful and invigorated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8068_b;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. Knowing that their blessings are said to have great power I could not help but seek out one who is said to have a way to heal the sick. I spent some time with this man and ate and drank a variety of things according to his instructions. For the most part it is hard to remember what happened but it appears I slept for several days before leaving him with a feeling of invigoration I have not felt for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8070;Surrounded by pilgrims, temples and shrines it is hard not to be taken aback by the great faith of the masses. Their reverence really is quite endearing. Should I reveal my true identity to them and receive their open adoration and worship? What better place to do this than here, a destination they have all sought out to experience my favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8071;Enrichment of the spirit is all well and good but perhaps it is now time to see what the temporal world has to offer. Surely there is both food, good company and good drink to be had nearby? Now that I am here I must sate my appetite for the local delicacies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8072;The adoration I thought I saw was clearly nothing but blind stupidity! These pilgrims are fools and do not know the full extent of my power. The lucky ones may never find out but those that ejected me from the temple grounds will curse this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8091;I am home at last after my journey. I have learnt new things, experienced the greatness of the faith and met with interesting people. While it is good to be home I am confident that I will always remember this trip very fondly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8092;I am home at last after a long journey. While it is said that a pilgrimage can rejuvenate the soul and body I cannot claim it did for me. On the whole this has been a most disappointing experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8093;I am finally home after a long and tiring journey. Though the insolent rats did not recognize me or pay proper homage, it was still an enlightening experience. Now there is plenty of time to prepare their day of reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_8023;Pay them their fee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8024;Turn, and run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8025;I can learn much from these villagers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8026;This is a marvelous opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8027;I must thank them for their kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8028;A small offering and then I must continue onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8029;I must learn more about these reservoirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8030;I must stay and learn what these people can teach me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8031;Let us rest and enjoy city life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8031_TOOLTIP;You will make new acquaintances.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8034;I have made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8035;It would seem I have made a new enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8036;It is time we continue towards our goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8037;I am sure everything is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8050;I must seek the middle way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8051;I too seek to be enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8052;As is fitting for a disciple of Buddha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8053;It is time I proceed to the temples and mathas of this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8054;I must continue my ascent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8055;It is time to begin my ascent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8056;It is beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8057;I believe it is time for a bath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8061;The study of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] will be my priority from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8062;I cannot wait to tell others about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8063;What is my purpose here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8064;It is but a small contribution to the knowledge of mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8065;I must talk to them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8066;Perhaps the time has come to begin the journey home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8067;Yes, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8068;I have been healed by a higher power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8070;Let them see me for who I truly am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8071;Let us see what this place truly has to offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8072;They do not realize what they have awoken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8091;A great experience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8092;My home is my castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8093;They will pay for their shortsightedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_8001;I will go to Bodh Gaya, where Buddha achieved enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8002;I will travel to the mountain of Girnar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8003;I will travel to the mountain of Girnar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8020;I regret setting out on this adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8021;Such is life in the dry season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8022;I should have paid better attention to their instructions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8023;We must defend what is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8024;I must fight this beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_8027;They are only giving me what is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8028;It is time to rest and heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8029;Such a futile endeavor, rain falls where it wills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8030;I have no time to lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8031;City life is an unnecessary diversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8037;I cannot let go of these thoughts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8061;Enlightenment can only be achieved through Meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8065;I must observe and learn about the peoples of this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8067;I must exercise control of the body as well as the mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8068;This man was truly a great healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8070;They could not bear to receive me in full glory, for now I must spare them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
