EVTDESC_HF_12001;"For [Root.Society.GetName]!" I proclaim, raising my glass. The cheers around the table are boisterous and the air hangs heavy with anticipation. "There is nothing left here to conquer!" someone laughs. Raising an eyebrow conspiratorially, [fellow_hero_1.GetFirstName] murmurs: "Have you ever been to [target_title.GetName]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12002;[original_hero.GetTitledFirstName] has declared that the highest ranking members of [Root.Society.GetName] are to go on an adventure, into [target_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName], the lands of [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]. After the cheers have gone around the table, I am left with my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12005_A;[giving_member.GetTitledFirstName] approaches me, as I am poring over some maps of [target_title.GetName]. A servant alerts me to [giving_member.GetHerHis] visit, and as I glance up from the table, I notice they are carrying something wrapped in fine fabric. "For the battles to come", the [giving_member.GetManWoman] says, without further ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12006;My history in battle is known to many, but there are still those who could benefit from learning more about my experiences. "Like that time you chopped someone's head off?" [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] asks, in response to my idea. "A feast, where you regale your court with the stories!" [fellow_member.GetSheHe] continues. I consider the spirits it could lift, as I soon depart for [target_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12007;To bolster [fellow_member.GetHerHis] confidence for our adventure into [target_title.GetName], I am showing [fellow_hero_1.GetTitledFirstName] around my trophy room. "You are... a collector of skulls then", the [fellow_hero_1.GetManWoman] comments, before interrupting [fellow_member.GetHerselfHimself]: "Oh, but this one would make a fine chalice!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12008;Out [Root.GetRidingMarching] with [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName], my eagle by my side, the [fellow_member.GetManWoman] showers both me and my bird with compliments. "You make a great team", [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] concludes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12009;The time has come for us to move into enemy territory. [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] and I are toasting once more, to [Root.Society.GetName]. "We shall find their most experienced warriors, and show them what it means to be [Root.Culture.GetName]!" I declare. "Everyone shall know our name!" [fellow_member.GetSheHe] agrees, slamming [fellow_member.GetHerHis] fist into the table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_A;We are camped [target_ruler.Capital.GetInOn] the [target_ruler.Capital.GetTerrain], on our way to [target_title.GetName]. While I am scouting the perimeter, I hear the sound of fighting. As I lean out from behind a [target_ruler.Capital.GetTreeRockFence], I spot a [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] wrestling a [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal]! And winning...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_B;Having spent the evening drinking and talking around the campfire with my traveling companions, I finally bid them good night. On my way back to my sleeping spot, I pause. Nearby, leaning against a [target_ruler.Capital.GetTreeRockFence], is a [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] tending to nature's call. "An enemy!" I yell, more surprised than alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_C;Walking through the streets of a village in [target_ruler.Capital.GetName], the locals seem eager to point out how foreign I am. They have clearly never seen a [Root.GetManWoman] like me before, and while some are adoring my armor and confident stride, it does not take long before I encounter open hostility. "Go home!" one [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] barks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_D;Having turned in for the night, I find myself wide awake listening to the snoring of [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]. Just as I am about to get up and do something about my irritation, I hear a rustling in the bushes. Before I can get to my feet, I find a [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] leaning over me, eying me suspiciously, a weapon aimed at my throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_E;"The finest warrior around? Well, that would be [my_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.GetMasterMistress]", a little [Root.GetBoyGirl] says. [fellow_member.GetFirstName] fishes a coin from [fellow_member.GetHerHis] pockets, rewarding the urchin for the information. "There [my_duel_target.GetSheHe] is!" the child suddenly cries, pointing at a [my_duel_target.Culture.GetName] [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] down the street.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_F;Walking through the streets of a village in [target_ruler.Capital.GetName], the locals seem eager to point out how foreign I am. They have clearly never seen a [Root.GetManWoman] like me before, and while some are adoring my armor and confident stride, it does not take long before I encounter open hostility. "Go home!" one [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] barks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_X;I have been following a rumor, trying to track down what is supposed to be the most feared fighter in [target_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. A deadly fencer, I'm told. "You go to your death!" an innkeeper warns. Yet, when [combatant_2.GetSheHe]'s pointed out to me, I find myself face to face with a hunched elderly [combatant_2.GetManWoman], eyeing me suspiciously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_Y;I've partaken in a local tournament, and I have been knocking out [target_ruler.Culture.GetName] fighters with ease. Grinning, I search the crowd for the face of [fellow_member.GetFirstName], who has been cheering me on. I find [fellow_member.GetHerHim] looking a bit pale. Turning to face my final foe I hear someone shouting an introduction: "[combatant_2.GetBestName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12010_Z;Rumors of my adventures have been spreading here in [target_title.GetName] and I have received a personal invite from [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], to appear at [target_ruler.GetHerHis] court. "To the brute [Root.GetFirstName]. If you insist on causing trouble like this, you will fight someone I choose", the pompous messenger reads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12011;[original_hero.GetTitledFirstName] has declared that the highest ranking members of [Root.Society.GetName] are to go on an adventure, into [target_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName], the lands of [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]. "You still have some growing to do, [Root.GetFirstName]", [original_hero.GetSheHe] tells me, before raising [original_hero.GetHerHis] mug again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12012;As I am soon to be off into the lands of [target_title.GetName], my [Root.GetMyMarshalName] [marshal_character.GetTitledFirstName] is concerned for our troops being without leadership. "Might I suggest you leave your [target_artifact.GetName] behind, as a token of your continued guidance?" [marshal_character.GetSheHe] offers. "If nothing else, you should have that thing sharpened, my [Root.GetLordLady]" [marshal_character.GetSheHe] frowns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12102;My travel companion and fellow [Root.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been taken prisoner by [enemy_captor.Culture.GetName] [enemy_captor.GetTitle], after challenging [enemy_captor.GetHerHim] to one on one combat...! "Not quite as planned", I mumble to myself, as I struggle to fall asleep tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12102_B;While out on their raid into foreign territory, the [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been taken prisoner by [enemy_captor.Culture.GetName] [enemy_captor.GetTitle], after challenging [enemy_captor.GetHerHim] to one on one combat...!\n"I thought we only sent our brightest", I mutter to the servant delivering the news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12102_B_other_reason;While dreaming of fighting [From.GetHerHis] way through foreign territory, the [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has instead been taken prisoner by [enemy_captor.GetTitledFirstName]!\n"How the mighty have fallen", a servant chimes, before I shush at him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12102_other_reason;One moment we were dreaming of fighting our way through foreign lands, and the glory that awaited us back home. The next, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has instead been taken prisoner by [enemy_captor.GetTitledFirstName]! I admit, it does not quite fit  the story I was hoping we'd tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12103;[From.GetTitledName] has perished during [From.GetHerHis] adventurous journey through foreign lands. Everyone who fought alongside [From.GetHerHim] know that [From.GetSheHe] died a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_A;The [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal] dead on the ground, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] braces for my attack. I call out: "For [Root.Society.GetName]!", my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] swooshing, nay, singing through the air. With the trees as our audience, and only witness to my deed, I have soon seen to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_B;Albeit under the influence, the battle stance comes naturally to me. My opponent staggers backwards in surprise, almost tripping over the [target_ruler.Capital.GetTreeRockFence]. Before [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has time to catch up, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_C;I draw my weapon, without hesitation. The crowd scatters around us and my opponent and I fall into circling one another. The ensuing fight is more even than I care to admit. At the end, I am sending a quiet prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], as I take in the cheers of our audience, and slam my weapon against [other_combatant.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_D;As soon as the camp is out of earshot, my opponent draws [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon. Wind moves over the moonlit meadow, the grass bending in waves, causing it look as if the ground itself is breathing, under our feet. "This is too easy", I murmur. Then I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_E;[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] motions for people to get out of the way, just before [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] lunges at me, indignity on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I parry immediately, defending myself well, judging by the excited cheers of our spectators. At the end of it all, the crowd has grown still, the streets flowing with the blood of their [other_combatant.Culture.GetName] warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_F;My opponent seems to be getting tired, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves becoming slower. Strengthened by the cheers of the crowd, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_X;As the [combatant_2.GetManWoman] unclasps [combatant_2.GetHerHis] cloak, I gasp. Beneath the disguise of a poor and withered elder, is an athletic and statuesque person, donned in fanciful armor. [combatant_2.GetSheHeCap] lashes out at me with a silvery sword, and I almost scream in surprise. When it is over, I am bloody and out of breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_Y;The crowd is cheering loudly as the giant looms over me. All the men I have fought so far pale in comparison. "YOU DIE NOW!" the beast of a [combatant_2.GetManWoman] roars, swinging a massive club. When it fails to hit me and bites the ground, the earth shakes. As [combatant_2.GetSheHe] moves to lift it again, I strike! The crowd falls silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12200_Z;"A brute gets to fight a brute!", [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] proclaims, gesturing to the stage, where a... "That's a bear", I say, clearly less alarmed than expected. "I have fought bears before", I continue, picking up my [Root.GetDuelWeapon]. The creature roars. While the ensuing fight takes time, the monster soon lies at my feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_A;As I charge into the glade, I jump over the beast, now laying still on the ground. My opponent yelps, clearly worn out from [other_combatant.GetHerHis] previous fight. "Need to catch your breath, huh?" I snicker, hefting my [Root.GetDuelWeapon]. Then I hear an angry growl behind me. I turn, finding myself face to face with a furious [target_ruler.Capital.GetRegionalBigAnimal]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_B;"You must be lost!" I proclaim, drawing my weapon. I sway a little, internally cursing the alcohol in my veins. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman]'s face darkens, and I swallow. A scout! A spy? My mind races. "Your liege knows we are here then?" I demand to know, but my opponent has already slashed my guts open. "You heathen drunk", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] mutters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_C;"You want me to DUEL you?", the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] mocks, rolling [other_combatant.GetHerHis] eyes. The next thing I know, I am under a furious flurry of attacks, only barely keeping up with my opponent. A young girl screams as I collapse into the crowd, bloody and unable to stand any longer. "Inform [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], that the heathen troll is dead", is the last thing I hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_D;I hear birds. It must be dawn, I think to myself. Why does my face feel cold, my limbs frozen...? Tensing, I cannot move. What happened? We fought on a meadow, the moon was guiding me, and... I fell. That blasted scout skewered me, with [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sword. Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], welcome me to your side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_E;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] seems to be flying towards me, swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon vigorously. [fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] pulls a small child out of our way, and yells for the crowd to step back. My opponent's technique appears more focused on showmanship than actual swordplay, and I find myself drawn in by the spectacle. Then suddenly, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon sinks into my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_X;"I keep telling you plucky fools: I am retired", the [combatant_2.GetManWoman] hisses, unsheathing a silvery sword and straightening [combatant_2.GetHerHis] back. It dawns on me that my original assessment was wrong. "You're... Some kind of dueli-", I try, but I do not have time to finish my words. I am spluttering blood, staring in disbelief as my killer walks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_Y;The giant only grunts in response to my taunts, sluggishly swinging [combatant_2.GetHerHis] massive club. I slash at [combatant_2.GetHerHis] legs and unprotected arms, and the crowd roars with excitement. Suddenly, my opponent discards [combatant_2.GetHerHis] weapon, declaring: "I'll stop toying with you now, barbarian". [combatant_2.GetHerHisCap] swings pick up speed. I have nowhere to run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12201_Z;"A BEAR?" I protest. "Aye, my [Root.GetLordLady]", the spindly man nods, gesturing onto the stage. "Fight!", [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] proclaims, and I do. The bear is brutally strong, and a wild beast at that. My sword does little when it grazes [combatant_2.GetHerHis] fur, and I am being tossed around like a toy. I... Ouch! Arrgh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12300;Upon your return to [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.GetLegendaryReturnReception] The whole [Root.GetCapitalHolding] has been dressed in celebratory banners and your [my_beloved.GetRootRelation] [my_beloved.GetTitledFirstName] greets you with a smile. [Root.GetLegendaryAchievementSummary]\n\nFrom deeper in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] [Root.Society.GetName] are singing a song of battle, its melody inviting you to celebration...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12301;[From.GetTitledName], your [From.GetRootRelation], has left this earthly realm, but tales of [From.GetHerHis] adventures are all around us. The memory of the [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] warrior-[From.GetManWoman] is sure to live on, if not in the hearts of [From.GetHerHis] companions, so in the blood of [From.GetHerHis] family.\n\nA hero has left us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12302_A;They say that everyone in the [From.GetCapitalHolding] of [From.Capital.GetName] spent several moons preparing for the return of [From.GetTitledName]. The [From.GetManWoman] has been the main source of interest and fascinating rumor since even before [From.GetSheHe] left for [target_title.GetName], but reports all agree that the pomp is well deserved. As [From.Society.GetName] celebrate this warrior's victory, we pray that our young find this living legend an ideal worthy of emulating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12302_B;They say [From.Capital.GetName] will spend decades mourning the loss of [From.GetTitledName]. Rarely have the [From.Culture.GetName] seen a warrior like [From.GetFirstName], and the [From.GetCapitalHolding] in [From.Capital.Capital.GetName] will forever be the home of the fascinating [From.GetManWoman]. As members of [Root.Society.GetName], we are grateful for the time we shared, and we pray that our young find this legend an ideal worthy of emulating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12303;Having wreaked havoc in the realm of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], the warrior scoundrel [bloodline_founder.GetTitledName] has been carving a name for [bloodline_founder.GetHerselfHimself] in blood. Our records will remember that [bloodline_founder.GetSheHe] and [bloodline_founder.GetHerHis] band of warriors have taken great pleasure in cutting their way through our countryside, fighting any willing man or woman who dared stand in their way, leaving traumatized children and devastated villagers in their wake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12400;Wings brushing my shoulder, dark eyes trusting me. I... I must have been dreaming about hunting with my eagle. "My [Root.GetLordLady]! I tried to stop it, but it just flew in through the [Root.GetChamberOpening]!", an embarrassed servant blurts as I rub my eyes, realizing I can still hear the gentle cawing of a bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12401;Training with my soldiers, I find myself distracted by an excited barking from the barracks. "What *is* that noise?", I finally demand to know. My sparring partner lowers [Root.GetHerHis] weapon and clears [Root.GetHerHis] throat: "It was going to be a surprise, my [Root.GetLordLady], but we got a new puppy...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12402;From playing its favorite games in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], to warming my feet in the winter, my trusted war hound has taken its last breaths. "I will... Leave you alone with [Root.GetDogName], [Root.GetMasterMistress]" a servant says, wiping a tear from her face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_12405;"My [Root.GetLordLady]!", the [Root.GetWarriorRole] struggling next to me shouts. "We have to do something about these [enemy_liege.Culture.GetName] soldiers! They are gaining on us!".\n"What do you expect me to do?" I shout back over the turmoil of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_12001;Capital idea, [fellow_hero_1.GetFirstName]! Let's seek out fighters in [target_title.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12001_TT;A group of heroes begin preparing for a journey into the realm of §Y[target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]§!. For blood and glory!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12002;Terrific initiative! It is about time we earned our names as warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12002_TT;You will follow §Y[original_hero.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! lead, and venture forth, into blood and (hopefully) glory.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12005;I will make certain this is put to good use, [giving_member.GetBrotherSister]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12006;Yes, such an opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12007;Yes, I'll have someone fashion a cup out of one of these.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12007_TT;You set your finest craftsmen to re-purpose the old trophy.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12008;You are right. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is always there for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12008_TT;You gently stroke the head of the eagle.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12009;Yes! Together we are stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_A;A challenge! *clears throat* Hey, you! Yes, you! Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_A_TT;The [my_duel_target.GetManWoman] wipes some blood off [my_duel_target.GetHerHis] face, before steadying [my_duel_target.GetHerselfHimself] to face you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_B;Oh, excellent! I will duel this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_C;You want to say that to my face? Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_D;You come armed, I see... How about we do this one on one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_D_TT;You challenge the scout to a duel, and the two of you meet on a moonlit field.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_E;Aah, such fortune! My [my_duel_target.GetLordLady]! Come face me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_E_TT;§Y[my_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName]§! stops in [my_duel_target.GetHerHis] tracks, drawing a weapon...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_F;A challenge! I will duel this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_X;I will not go easy on you, just because you're old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_X_TT;The [combatant_2.GetManWoman] throws off [combatant_2.GetHerHis] cowl, accepting your challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_Y;Finally, a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_Y_TT;You will duel the tallest [combatant_2.GetManWoman] you have ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_Z;I am not afraid. I will duel any of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] champions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12010_Z_TT;As you accept, the messenger snickers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12011;Pfft. Good luck, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12012;The weapon could use some love, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12012_diplo;Sharpen it! I'll inform the troops of the confidence I have in you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12102;Blasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12102_TT;The legendary journey is over for §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12103;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12103_TT;Others will carry on the legendary journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12104;So it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12300;For every [Root.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12301;We will remember you, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12302;May we all share in [From.GetHerHis] glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12303;It is the way of barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12400;What do we have here? A new friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12400_TT;You will care for the young bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12401;I... I *have* been missing a companion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12401_TT;You will care for the dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12402;It was an honor to serve with you, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12402_TT;Perhaps you will get a new dog. One day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_12405;Battle hymns! Of course! *clears throat*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_12001;I am quite comfortable here in [Root.Capital.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12002_TT;You will be §Rblocked§! from ranking up to [Root.GetSocietyRank] again.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12005;Oh, this is far too generous. I shall pay you for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12006;I would rather focus on my personal training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12007;Actually, staring into its hollow eyes gives me great comfort as is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12008;Actually, it is just a bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12009;The glory will be all mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_A;This one looks too big for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_A_TT;You back away...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_B;I should just leave you be, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_C;This one looks too big for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_D;[fellow_member.GetFirstName]! WAKE UP!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_D_TT;Together with §Y[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]§!, you fight the scout off.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_E;... On second thought, perhaps this one is for you, [fellow_member.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_E_TT;§Y[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]§! cracks [fellow_member.GetHerHis] knuckles, eager for a fight.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_F;You are entitled to your opinion, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12010_TT;The legendary journey is over for you, and you return home in shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12011;I know I still have a lot to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12012;I trust you will take good care of it, [Root.GetMyMarshalName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12102;This is becoming too dangerous for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12102_TT;The legendary journey is over, for both you and §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\nYou return home in shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12103;And then there was only one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12103_B;And so it falls to me to continue this journey alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12103_TT;It is you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12400;By my [bloodline_founder.GetRootRelation]! A new friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12400_TT;You get the feeling that §Y[bloodline_founder.GetTitledFirstName]§! would approve of you caring for the young bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12401;By my [bloodline_founder.GetRootRelation]! A dog, for *me*?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12401_TT;You get the feeling that §Y[bloodline_founder.GetTitledFirstName]§! would approve of you caring for the dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_12405;Clang your swords together! To the rhythm of BLOOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_12005;I think you need this more than I, [giving_member.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_12012;I am not letting anyone else touch this weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
