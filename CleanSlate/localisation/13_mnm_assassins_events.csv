EVTDESC_MNM_6001;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI have decided to grant your request for a loan. I trust that you pay the sum back within a reasonable time and as soon as you are able.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6005;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour generous gift to the Order shall not be forgotten. The money will come to good use in the defense against those who threaten the true faith. \n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6006_A;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nThe time has come for you to repay your debt to the Order. I trust you send me the [Root.assassins_debt.GetValue] gold as soon as you receive this letter.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6006_B;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nThe time has come for you to repay your debt to the Order. If you cannot spare the [Root.assassins_debt.GetValue] gold, I have another suggestion. The order is in unending need of champions and your [child_offer.GetRootRelation] [child_offer.GetFirstName] would make an excellent addition to our ranks.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6006_C;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nThe time has come for you to repay your debt to the Order. If you cannot spare the [Root.assassins_debt.GetValue] gold, I have another suggestion. If you allow us to build a castle in [castle_offer.GetName] and aid us in its construction, your debt shall be forgotten.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6020_A;Most guests have departed and evening has turned into early morning, yet [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] and I are still deep in conversation. We are talking about religion, righteousness, how to do the right thing. [assassins_recruiter.GetFirstName] suggests that giving alms and fasting must surely bring mortals closer to the divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6020_B;Most guests have departed and evening has turned into early morning, yet I and [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] are still deep in conversation. We are discussing a hadith [assassins_recruiter.GetFirstName] just read. [assassins_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] suggest that its narrator, Abu Hurairah, might be unreliable and asks if the hadiths recorded by Ali are not preferable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6021_A;I approached [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] during a feast last night, intending to figure out whether [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] might be persuaded to convert to the true faith. We had a long, deep conversation and it seems like [assassins_recruitee.GetFirstName] is of sound opinions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6021_B;Last night I approached [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] during a feast, intending to figure out whether [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] might be persuaded to convert to the true faith. Unfortunately, as soon I steered the conversation towards the topics of the Prophet and his rightful heir, Ali, the narrow-minded [assassins_recruitee.GetManWoman] became quite disagreeable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6021_c;Last night I approached [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] during a feast, intending to figure out whether [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] might be persuaded to convert to the true faith. Unfortunately, as soon I steered the conversation towards the topics of the [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], the narrow-minded [assassins_recruitee.GetManWoman] became quite disagreeable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6022_A;Since I had such a good time a few weeks back, I invited [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] to share an informal meal. Yet again the conversation found its way to the topic of religion and righteousness. [assassins_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] expressed [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] admiration for those willing to give their life fighting for their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[assassins_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] expresses [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] admiration for those willing to give their life fighting for their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6023_A;I was just about to draft an invitation when [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to dine with [assassins_recruitee.GetHerHim]. We talked for many hours, even as the plates were emptied and the cups drained. As I praised those willing to die for their faith, [assassins_recruitee.GetFirstName] agreed wholeheartedly, wishing [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] could be more like them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6023_B;I was just about to draft an invitation when [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] invited you to dine with [assassins_recruitee.GetHerHim]. The conversation flowed easily and [assassins_recruitee.GetFirstName] expressed many admirable sentiments. However, when I mentioned those willing to die for their beliefs, [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] sneered and condemned "such fanatics".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6024_A;We are quiet for a moment, both seemingly contemplating these devoted souls. Then [assassins_recruiter.GetFirstName] looks up at me, a curious intensity in [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] gaze. "That is not an impossible wish, [Root.GetFirstName]. Are you ready to kill and, if He wills it, get killed to defend the words of His Prophet and the rightful heir?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Then [assassins_recruiter.GetFirstName] looks up at me, a curious intensity in [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] gaze. "That is not an impossible wish, [Root.GetFirstName]. Are you ready to kill and, if They will it, get killed to defend the words of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6025;When I suggested there is a way for [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] only scoffed dismissively and changed the subject. Judging by the look [assassins_recruitee.GetSheHe] gave me as I left, however, it seems as if [assassins_recruitee.GetFirstName] is not so oblivious after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6026;When I suggested there is a way for [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [assassins_recruitee.GetHerHis] eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope. "I am ready, [Root.GetFirstName]. Please, if it is true, will you set me on this path?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6027_A;"I do, [Root.GetFirstName]," says [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] with a solemn, almost ceremonial, voice. "There is an Order devoted to Allah and the rightful Caliph. One that defends those true of faith and bring vengeance to their persecutors. The Assassins are always in need of champions. Think it over, and someone might reach out...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6027_B;"I do, [Root.GetFirstName]," says [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] with a solemn, almost ceremonial, voice. "There is an Order devoted to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]. One that defends those true of faith and bring vengeance to their persecutors. The Assassins are always in need of champions. Think it over, and someone might reach out...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6028;My eyes open, seeing only darkness. For a moment, my mind is blank, before the first thoughts get through the haze of sleep. Why did I wake up? A deep [Root.GetManWoman]'s voice cuts through the silence, startling me. "The time has come for you to profess your devoutness to Allah and the rightful imam Ali.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6028_ALT;My eyes open, seeing only darkness. For a moment, my mind is blank, before the first thoughts get through the haze of sleep. Why did I wake up? A deep [Root.GetManWoman]'s voice cuts through the silence, startling me. "The time has come for you to profess your devoutness to [shiite.GetHighGodName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6029;"Excellent." I turn my head towards the voice. A hooded figure steps out of the shadows by the [Root.GetChamberOpening] and a hand appears from underneath the cloak, holding out a piece of parchment. "Before we continue, you must sign this. A written pledge of allegiance to the Grand Master of the Assassins. A routine... safety measure.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6030;As soon as I lift the tip of the quill from the parchment the hooded [Root.GetManWoman] snatches it from the desk. "The Grand Master will be pleased, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. You will receive an invitation to our stronghold, but for now, go back to bed. You will need the rest." The next moment, [Root.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6033;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nYou are hereby invited to the Assassins stronghold in [inductor_rendezvous.County.GetName]. Arrive at the [inductor_rendezvous.GetHolding] of [inductor_rendezvous.GetName] in a fortnight's time. One of our people will collect you there. Until then, keep safe, and breath not a word of this meeting to any living soul.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6034;The journey to [inductor_rendezvous.GetName] was comfortable, however, the dwindling mountain path to the Assassins' stronghold was a torment to tread. As I finally arrive at the castle, my guide brings me to the main tower, where I am introduced to [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6035;There is no time for pleasantries, not even a moment to catch my breath, before [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] leads me through another door, down a spiraling stone staircase. We descend in silence. The stair ends and the [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] opens another door, revealing a gloomy basement room and a figure kneeling on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_A;"This," [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [assassins_inductor.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman]'s head. It is [assassins_sacrifice.GetTitledFirstName], my [assassins_sacrifice.GetRootRelation]! The shock in [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim]." The [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_B;"This," [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [assassins_inductor.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [Root.GetManWoman]'s head. It is one of my servants! The shock in [Root.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [Root.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [Root.GetHerHim]." The [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6037;The blood is still gushing from the infidel's limp body as I kneel in front of the [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank]. [assassins_inductor.GetSheHeCap] recites the oath of the Assassins and I repeat after [assassins_inductor.GetHerHim]. As [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] speaks the final words, inducting me into the order, [assassins_inductor.GetSheHe] smears the blood across my cheeks. "Stand up, Adherent [Root.GetFirstName]. Welcome to the Assassins.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_A;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] I sink it into [assassins_inductor.GetHerHis] stomach. I free my intended victim and drag [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim] after me, up the stairs, without looking back once. You just keep running. By some miracle, no one intervenes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_B;I turn around and run. [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName]'s footsteps get closer behind me and as I reach the top of the stairs, [assassins_inductor.GetSheHe] grips a fistful of my mantle, pulling you down on top of [assassins_inductor.GetHerHis]. Vertigo. Crippling pain. Blind, manic frenzy. By some miracle, you manage to free yourself. You are alive. But for how much longer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_C;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName] I stab at [assassins_inductor.GetHerHim], without a moment's hesitation. The blade strikes only air. [assassins_inductor.GetSheHeCap] moves too quickly. I am on the floor, trapped under the weight of [assassins_inductor.GetHerHis] body. I plead for my life as [assassins_inductor.GetSheHe] wrestles the weapon from my hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_D;The look on [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_inductor.GetFirstName]'s face is pure disappointment. "We had high hopes for you, [Root.GetFirstName], although it seems we were mistaken." I swallow. Loudly. "This cowardice makes you useless to us. Your gold, on the other hand..." As I leave, my intended victim in tow, my hands will not stop shaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6039;You have no idea what happened as you wake up on the floor of your [Root.GetChamber], a taste of blood in your mouth and a pounding ache along the side of your face. Slowly, the memories come back. A hooded [Root.GetManWoman]... The Assassins. Perhaps you should consider yourself lucky, getting away with only a black eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6041_A;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe recruit you sent us, [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName], has now completed [assassins_recruitee.GetHerHis] induction into the order. I thank you for this contribution – it will not be forgotten.\n\nPraise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6041_B;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe recruit you sent us, [assassins_recruitee.GetTitledFirstName], proved to be disaster. We have spent significant resources in our attempt to induct [assassins_recruitee.GetHerHim], all for naught. This lack of judgment will be remembered.\n\nSigned, Grand Master [grand_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_A;After having relentlessly studied [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s habits and movements, I finally believe I have found the perfect opportunity for the grand spectacle that will be [plot_target.GetHerHis] death. In a week's time, when [plot_target.GetFirstName] leaves the [plot_target.GetHouseOfWorship] after [plot_target.GetReligiousRite]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_B;Not even the thick walls of [plot_target.Host.GetTitledFirstName]'s prison can protect [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] from Allah's judgment. After having spent many nights watching the rotation of the guards and studied the [plot_target.Host.GetCapitalHolding] from every angle, I think I have found my opening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_C;The craven [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] has gone into hiding, but no walls or disguises can save [plot_target.GetHerHim] from Allah's wrath. I have identified the servant who brings [plot_target.GetHerHim] messages and last night I followed [Root.GetHerHim] all the way to [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s lair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_D;The thick [plot_target.Host.Capital.GetHolding] walls of [plot_target.Location.Capital.GetName] might offer [plot_target.GetHerHim] shelter from the epidemic, but the wrath of the Assassins know no such obstacles. After having spent many nights watching the rotation of the guards and studied the [plot_target.Location.GetHolding] from every angle, I think I have found my opening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_E;The thick [plot_target.Host.Capital.GetHolding] walls of [plot_target.Location.Capital.GetName] might offer [plot_target.GetHerHim] shelter from lesser dangers, but the wrath of the Assassins know no such obstacles. After having spent many nights watching the rotation of the guards and studied the [plot_target.Location.GetHolding] from every angle, I think I have found my opening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6100_F;My target, [plot_target.GetTitledName], is hosting a feast in [plot_target.Location.Capital.GetName] and I have successfully infiltrated [plot_target.GetHerHis] kitchen staff. This will be spectacular...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6102_A;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe time has come to put an end to [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] and [plot_target.GetHerHis] sins. In a week's time, when [plot_target.GetFirstName] leaves the [plot_target.GetHouseOfWorship] after [plot_target.GetReligiousRite], I will strike [plot_target.GetHerHim] down.\n\nMay our enemies cower in fear!\nSigned, [assassin.GetSocietyRank] [assassin.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6102_B;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe time has come to put an end to [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] and [plot_target.GetHerHis] sins. I have found a way into the prison where [plot_target.GetSheHe] is held.\n\nMay our enemies cower in fear!\nSigned, [assassin.GetSocietyRank] [assassin.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6102_C;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe time has come to put an end to [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] and [plot_target.GetHerHis] sins. I have discovered the den in which [plot_target.GetSheHe] is cowering.\n\nMay our enemies cower in fear!\nSigned, [assassin.GetSocietyRank] [assassin.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6102_D;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nThe time has come to put an end to [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] and [plot_target.GetHerHis] sins. I have found a way into the [plot_target.Host.Capital.GetHolding] where [plot_target.GetSheHe] resides.\n\nMay our enemies cower in fear!\nSigned, [assassin.GetSocietyRank] [assassin.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_A;There is a solemn, almost reverential, atmosphere as the crowd pours out of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] after the [Root.GetReligiousRite]. I follow the flow of people absentmindedly while I ponder what the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] said regarding right and wrong, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Suddenly, I stumble. A moment later something heavy pushes me down into the dirt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_B;As the cell door creaks I steady myself. [Host.GetTitledFirstName]'s jailer is a brute of a [Host.GetManWoman]. However, when faint light of a distant torch reveals the silhouette in the doorway, my heart sinks from its position in my stomach to the floor. This is not the jailer. And... is that a dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_C;I open my eyes and suddenly I feel wide awake. Something is not right, I can sense it with all my being. Why is the window open...?\nThe whisper emerging from the shadows is soft as silk. "Did you think you could escape the Assassins, [Root.GetFirstName]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_D;The atmosphere at court grows more strained each day, so I thought a little feast would do us all good. I am conversing with [conversationalist.GetTitledFirstName] over the main course when the loud clatter of a serving dish crashing to the floor makes me jump out of my seat. I face the clumsy servant but words fail me as I discover the dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_E;It... it is so hard to breathe. A heavy weight is pressing down on me, constricting my chest, pushing the air out of my lungs. As the worlds come in to focus I see a figure hovering over me. Is that a dagger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_F;I am conversing with [conversationalist.GetTitledFirstName] over the main course when the loud clatter of a serving dish crashing to the floor makes me jump out of my seat. I face the clumsy servant but words fail me as I discover the dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_A;"I am here to carry out Allah's judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]." The [assassin.GetManWoman]'s voice is deep, tinted with a strange accent. It rises to a loud shout, "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" The afternoon sun is reflected in the raised dagger, blinding me as [assassin.GetSheHe] stabs downwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_B;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins." There is nowhere to run. Nothing within reach to use as a weapon. [assassin.GetSheHeCap] points the dagger at me, and says solemnly: "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_C;I grasp for the dagger under my pillow, but the shock of this unexpected visit has made my fingers stiff and movement imprecise. Before I can find it, the hooded figure is upon me. A dagger glints in the faint moonlight. "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_D;"The time has come for the judgment of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!" The guests fall silent as the [assassin.GetManWoman]'s shout echoes through the hall. A flash of gleaming metal, and then blood, pouring from between my fingers. A soft whisper as the world grows dim: "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_E;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins." The [assassin.GetManWoman]'s voice is deep, solemn. "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName]." The moonlight reflects in the dagger as [assassin.GetSheHe] raises it over her head. I close my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_A;It was easy to separate [plot_target.GetFirstName] from [plot_target.GetHerHis] guards. As if [plot_target.GetSheHe] was a sheep, I herded [plot_target.GetHerHim] into the midst of the crowd, where everyone would see. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" I shouted, raising my dagger. Those who saw will never forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_B;Due to my extensive preparations, entering the prison of [plot_target.Host.GetTitledFirstName] was almost too easy. The burly jailer had fallen asleep – one less death tonight, it seemed – but [plot_target.GetFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_C;[plot_target.GetFirstName] woke with a jerk as I slid through the window, scanning the room with a wild look on [plot_target.GetHerHis] face. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName]," I whispered and [plot_target.GetHerHis] head snapped towards the shadowy corner where I stood. [plot_target.GetSheHeCap] reached for something – a weapon, perhaps – but [plot_target.GetSheHe] was not nearly quick enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_D;Thanks to my servant's disguise I approached [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] unnoticed. [plot_target.GetHerHisCap] courtiers were loud and jolly, doing their best to forget the misery outside the [plot_target.GetCapitalHolding] walls. As I raised my voice and drew my dagger, however, they all fell silent. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_E;Once I had reached [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s [plot_target.GetChamber], my task became almost too easy. The feeble [plot_target.GetManWoman] could do nothing to defend [plot_target.GetHerselfHimself], if [plot_target.GetSheHe] was even aware of what was about to happen. "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName]." The moonlight reflected in my dagger as I raised it above my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6107;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nIt is done. [plot_target.GetTitledName] is dead. Everything went according to plan and no one will be able to track [plot_target.GetHerHis] death back to you.\n\nMay our enemies cower in fear!\nSigned, [assassin.GetSocietyRank] [assassin.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_A;"I am here to carry out [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]." The [assassin.GetManWoman]'s voice rises to a loud shout, "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" As I attempt to deflect the dagger, I manage to tear off [assassin.GetHerHis] mask, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_B;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins." There is no where to run. Nothing within reach to use as a weapon. So I shout. As [assassin.GetManWoman] launches [assassin.GetHerselfHimself] at me and in my attempt to defend myself I tear [assassin.GetHerHis] mask off, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_C;I shout as loud as I can. There are voices on the other side of the door, someone trying to tear it open, but they are too late. When the assassin launches [assassin.GetHerselfHimself] at me, I manage to tear off [assassin.GetHerHis] mask, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_D;"[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" As the assassin raises [assassin.GetHerHis] dagger, I grasp for anything within my reach, something to defend myself with. As the weapon tears my flesh I manage to pull down [assassin.GetHerHis] hood, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_E;My feeble cries seems to have alerted the guards, but they are too slow. "No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins. [Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName]." As [assassin.GetSheHe] raises the dagger, I struggle and manage to tear off the assassin's mask, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_A;At first, everything went according to plan. It was easy to separate [plot_target.GetFirstName] from [plot_target.GetHerHis] guards. However, when the time came to strike, my victim managed to tear of my mask, revealing my face to everyone around us. While it did not save [plot_target.GetHerHim], I almost did not escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_B;The burly jailer had fallen asleep, but [plot_target.GetFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. [plot_target.GetSheHeCap] launched [plot_target.GetHerselfHimself] at me, tearing of my mask. My blade slid easily between [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s ribs, but not before [plot_target.GetSheHe] could scream. I barely managed to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_C;[plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] woke with a jerk, scanning the room with a wild look on [plot_target.GetHerHis] face. "Guards!" [plot_target.GetSheHe] shouted, panic in [plot_target.GetHerHis] voice. I could hear movements in the adjacent room, and though they were too slow to save [plot_target.GetFirstName], they almost managed to catch me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_D;[plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] was holding a feast that night. While I managed to approach [plot_target.GetFirstName] unnoticed, [plot_target.GetSheHe] managed to tear off my hood, revealing my face to [plot_target.GetHerHis] entire court. I ended [plot_target.GetHerHim] nonetheless, but was almost caught in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_E;When I entered [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s [plot_target.GetChamber] and saw that feeble wretch sleeping in [plot_target.GetHerHis] bed I grew careless. How could this possibly go wrong? However, as I bent over [plot_target.GetFirstName], [plot_target.GetSheHe] opened [plot_target.GetHerHis] eyes and screamed. In the following struggle, my mask was torn off. While my dagger found its target, the guards got a good look at my face before I escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6110;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour wish has been fulfilled – the despicable [plot_target.GetTitledName] is dead.

EVTDESC_MNM_6111_A;"I am here to carry out [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]. [Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" The [assassin.GetManWoman] on top of me pulls a dagger from [assassin.GetHerHis] robes. I lunge for it, hitting it out of [assassin.GetHerHis] hand. I shout, drawing the attention of the crowd, and within heartbeats my assailant and I are separated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_B;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins." As the [assassin.GetManWoman] raises [assassin.GetHerHis] dagger, I do the only thing I can think of. I tackle [assassin.GetHerHim] to the filthy cell floor and run. I wake the snoring jailer as I sprint past. [Host.GetSheHeCap] catches me within a few heartbeats, but at least the assassin is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_C;I grasp for the dagger under my pillow, but the shock of this unexpected visit has made my fingers stiff and movement imprecise. So I shout, as loud as I can. The guards are forcing their way through the door as I roll off the bed, dodging a dagger. When I scramble to my feet, the assassin is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_D;"The time has come for the judgment of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!" The [assassin.GetManWoman] reaches for something inside [assassin.GetHerHis] robes, but then someone grabs me from behind, pulling me back. One of the guards tackle the assassin to the floor. There is blood, but it is not my assailant's. A moment later, [assassin.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_E;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins." There is nothing I can do but scream, so I do. Impressively so. There are echoes of footsteps and clashing metal from outside. Before my assailant can finish the deed, four guards burst through the [Root.GetChamberOpening]. The strange [assassin.GetManWoman] gives me one look and then [assassin.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_A;At first, everything went according to plan. It was easy to separate [plot_target.GetFirstName] from [plot_target.GetHerHis] guards. However, as I pulled my dagger, [From.GetSheHe] struck it out of my hand. I was about to reach for a second weapon, but upon hearing [plot_target.GetHerHis] screams, the people around us surged towards [plot_target.GetHerHim], separating us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_B;The burly jailer had fallen asleep but [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. As I lunged at [plot_target.GetHerHim], [plot_target.GetSheHe] managed to dodge me and ran, right into the arms of the jailer. Not wanting to share [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s cell, I slunk into the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_C;"[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName]!" I announced and the [plot_target.GetManWoman] woke with a jerk.

EVTDESC_MNM_6112_D;"The time has come for the judgment of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!" I raised my dagger, ready to strike, but then someone tackled me from behind. I stabbed, blade tearing flesh, hot blood running down my arm. When I got to my feet, [plot_target.GetFirstName] was outside of my reach. There were too many people, and weapons, between us. I turned around and ran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_E;"No one escapes [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s judgment, or the Assassins," I whispered as I bent over [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s sleeping figure. [plot_target.GetSheHeCap] woke with a start, and before I could bury the dagger in [plot_target.GetHerHim], [plot_target.GetSheHe] screamed. The next moment, guards burst through the door.

My guards are furious with the child, but noting the quiet defiance in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] eyes, I am reminded of myself. Remembering the mission assigned to me by the Assassins, I wonder if the child is as sly as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems – perhaps this incident could benefit us all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6252;Bolstered by my tutelage [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] is growing into a confident young [assassin_protege.GetBoyGirl]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] reads everything I throw at [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] and [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems eager to learn more about our beliefs... The next step for [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] should be chosen carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_A;The rigorous training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to subtly befriending several foreign diplomats at court, [assassin_protege.GetTitledName] has been studying the books fervently, even in candlelit hours. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_B;The combat training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to having spent rigorous amounts of time in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] practice grounds, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] clearly outmatches any opponents [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] own age. I believe a test is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_C;The rigorous schedule I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to demonstrating a knack for foreign languages, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] is proving increasingly proficient in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] combat training. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_A;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]. The reports state that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] somehow managed to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of it, convincing the attackers that they had the wrong target. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] then sent them on a wild goose-chase around the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], which I am told lasted hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_B;[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] expertly handled the surprise attack I planned out, striking the thugs down with frightening precision. When I explained that the men [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] had beaten, one even killed, had been working on my orders, [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] cocked an eyebrow at me before leaning back in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] chair, smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_C;The hired thugs I sent to ambush [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] came back bruised and confused tonight. When I confront my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] calmly explains that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] made them see the error of their ways. "One will likely die from the injury", I say. [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] nods slowly, before returning to [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_A;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and managed to sneak into a building to hide. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] caused quite a ruckus as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] stumbled into the bedroom of a local merchant and his wife. The escape from there was hasty, but I suppose I'm not entirely disappointed in [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] surviving the ambush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_B;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and eagerly drew [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] blade on them. The fight that ensued left both parties wounded, but at least [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] survived the ambush. I'll have to talk to [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] about the optimal points of attack on the human body, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_C;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] attempted to fool them by claiming my orders had changed, that the ambush was called off. While I am impressed that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] saw through the test, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] did not sell it completely, and instead ended up with running away in panic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6256;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] night when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] apparently tried to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of the situation, but the attackers were not so easily charmed... They were not supposed to injure [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] badly, but something must have gone wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6258;The time has come for me to confess my love for the one true god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_A;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has deeply impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that I should be proud to have been the guardian of this faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_B;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that they are pleased with my training of the faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_C;The death of my dear apprentice took me by surprise, but what is worse is the complete silence I have been met with from the Assassins. I can only assume that they are disappointed – all I can do is wait for a new mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_D;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that as soon as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] has agreed to convert to our faith, they will share in my pride as guardians of this remarkable young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_E;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that as soon as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] has agreed to convert to our faith, they will consider my mission to train the young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman] complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC_MNM_6259_F;The death of my dear apprentice took me by surprise, but what is worse is the complete silence I have been met with from the Assassins. I can only assume that they are disappointed – all I can do is wait for a new mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6260_A;My child, and apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination, has been the victim of an unexpected turn of events and a most untimely death. I could be beside myself with pain, but I must focus on recovering from the loss, while the Assassins are informed of my predicament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6260_B;My apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination has been the victim of an unexpected turn of events and a most untimely death. The Assassins will be informed of my loss and predicament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6800;It is time to open my mind to visions of paradise. They will ensure the steadiness of my hand as I act on behalf of the order, but how much do I dare reveal to myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6802_BAD;I woke in a haystack outside my tower window. My memories from the day before are hazy, but I remember the sensation of falling through darkness, surrounded by souls twisting and moaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6802_GOOD;The visions have revealed much to me. I understand so much more now, even a hint of my own place in the great mosaic of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6802_GREAT;Clarity! I can see the world as if I am soaring above it, with eyes as sharp as an eagle. Never before have I felt so aware.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6803;It has been weeks since I last used the hashish, and I find my thoughts returning to that day time and time again. My mind refuses to let go of the visions I had of Paradise, and I'm longing for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6805;It has been too long since the last time I used the hashish for the visions and I find myself growing more restless each day. My sleep is becoming erratic and I find it hard to focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6806;It has been months since the last time I used the hashish, and as the memory of my visions fade, so does my desperate desire to experience it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6813;The hashish has finally give me clarity, and now I see the treachery going on all around me. It is clear to me now that my [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] is having a relationship with [drug_cheater_lover.GetFirstName] behind my back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6814;My clothes! They come through the clothes! Subversive forces trying to sway the Righteous from the Path. We must get rid of it, so that They cannot use it, for if we wear them They will be close to the purity of our body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6815;The shadows close in from all around making the world seems so dark and frightening. My heart is racing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6816;As if from a haze, I emerge, once more standing in the light of the sun. I did not even fully understand what was weighing so heavily on my mind, but its dark grasp has finally loosened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6817;As my mind perceives the world in new and unexpected ways, the shapes in the smoke filling my chamber crystallize, and I begin to understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6818;As my body is purged by the intoxicating smoke, my very being changes, and what once ailed me can no longer touch what I have become.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6840;There is something strange, almost ominous, about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. The other day when we were exchanging pleasantries, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] asked me about my [Root.GetMatterOfImportance]. Normally, this would not unsettle me, but there was something about the tone of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] voice... Veiled or not, a threat is a threat, and this was certainly one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6841;When I met [From.GetTitledFirstName] the other day, I inquired about [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetMatterOfImportance]. [From.GetSheHeCap] certainly seemed to notice my veiled threat – [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetFaceDescription] face turned ashen and for the reminder of our conversation [From.GetSheHe] would not meet my gaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6842;I have marked [From.GetTitledFirstName] for death. Soon enough, one of my assassins will be sent on a mission to end [From.GetHerHis] life. They will notify me when the deed is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6843;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nIt is done. [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] has met [plot_target.GetHerHis] end at my hands. As these news reach our other enemies, they will tremble with fear!\n\nGlory to the Assassins!\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6900;I am trying to focus on my training, but [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] is always there! No matter if I am studying in the great Order library, hid behind piles of books, or sparring with a fellow Assassin, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] apparently has to do the same. And [friend_or_foe.GetHerHis] taunts and snide comments! They are driving me mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName]'s throat, [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] laughed heartily. ' A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_B;We were evenly matched, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [friend_or_foe.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [friend_or_foe.GetHerHis] arm. [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName]'s body shook as [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] laughed underneath me. 'A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_C;We were evenly matched, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I did not remember when we had lost our weapons. Now we were wrestling on the ground, neither of us getting enough of an advantage, sweat soaking our clothes and stinging our eyes. 'Draw?' I breathed. 'Alright, draw,' [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] chuckled in response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_D;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Impressive disguise, [friend_or_foe.GetSocietyRank]. I mean it,' [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] chuckled and gave me a hearty pat on the back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_E;We were evenly matched, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [friend_or_foe.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] lunged and nicked my arm as we fell. 'Good match, [friend_or_foe.GetSocietyRank],' [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] chuckled and rolled over on [friend_or_foe.GetHerHis] back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6904_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName]'s throat, [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] cursed my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6904_B;We were evenly matched, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [friend_or_foe.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [friend_or_foe.GetHerHis] arm. [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] cursed me loudly as [friend_or_foe.GetSheHe] pushed my body off [friend_or_foe.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6905_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Who laughs now, [Root.GetFirstName]?' [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] whispered before slashing the dagger across my shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6905_B;We were evenly matched, [friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [friend_or_foe.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [friend_or_foe.GetFirstName] lunged and slashed the blade across my dagger hand with a triumphant shout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_A;I could read [From.GetFirstName]'s answer in [From.GetHerHis] eyes as soon as the words had escaped my lips and my heart sank like a stone. It took [From.GetHerHim] a moment to recollect [From.GetHerselfHimself]. 'I am flattered, [From.GetFirstName]. Really, I am. But... I do not feel the same way. I'm sorry. Let us be friends?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_B;For a moment, the world stood still. I could not breathe. Then the most radiant, heart-warming smile spread across [From.GetFirstName]'s [From.GetFaceDescription] face. 'I thought you would never ask, [Root.GetFirstName].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6908_A;[friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] was not slow to accept my challenge. It was a simple one: we would both craft disguises and enter the nearby town at noon the next day. The first person to spot the other, sneak up on them and place a dagger at their throat would be the winner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6908_B;[friend_or_foe.GetTitledFirstName] gladly accepted my challenge. We decided to not complicate anything – a duel at midday the following day, a pair of daggers our only weapons. The first person to draw blood would be the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6912;While the uninitiated might believe that assassins always operate on their own, this is rarely the case. That being said, we are often occupied with our own, equally important, missions. [assassins_plotter.GetSocietyRank] [assassins_plotter.GetFirstName] has asked for my help assassinating [assassin_quest_target.GetTitledFirstName], however I am unsure if I can spare the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6922_A;I have found out that my superior, [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSocietyRank] [assassin_blackmail_target.GetFirstName], has a guilty pleasure. Despite [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHis] sober appearance, when no one is watching, [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSheHe] feasts on wine and treats. I have requested a meeting with [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHim] and dropped a hint about my recently acquired knowledge. How should I use it to my advantage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6922_B;I have found out that my superior, [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSocietyRank] [assassin_blackmail_target.GetFirstName], has a guilty pleasure. [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSheHeCap] is a slave to [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHis] carnal passions – I saw [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHim] together with [lover_of_target.GetTitledFirstName] myself. I have requested a meeting with [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHim] and dropped a hint about my recently acquired knowledge. How should I use it to my advantage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6922_C;A while ago, I noticed the frail nature of my superior, [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSocietyRank] [assassin_blackmail_target.GetFirstName]. People whisper about the [GetRootFromInsult], but no one has dared to draw any attention to the matter. However, for all [assassin_blackmail_target.GetSocietyRank] [assassin_blackmail_target.GetFirstName] knows, maybe there is a plot in the workings! I could blackmail [assassin_blackmail_target.GetHerHim] to get what I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6950;My target, the despicable [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], has died at my hands. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] got the end that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] deserved. The Grand Master will be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6980;When I met [From.GetTitledFirstName] the other day, I inquired about [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetMatterOfImportance]. [From.GetSheHeCap] certainly seemed to notice my veiled threat, but [From.GetHerHis] reaction was not what I expected. [From.GetFirstName] laughed right into my face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_MNM_6810;How could I not feel this hunger inside me before? No wonder the world is as it is when a hunger as demonic as this can reside silently for so long in my stomach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_6812;It is incredible how you can so easily not see a person close to you. I must have walked past [slacker_buddy.GetFirstName] hundreds of times without noticing him, but thanks to the Order I can now see what a good friend I have nearby!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_68112;Praise be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] for opening my vision, it is so obvious to me now that [drug_plotter_reveal.GetTitledName] is trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_MNM_6810;Through the smoke filling my room I see clearly. Traitors to the left of me and false believers to the right. All of them clamoring for my head. What a fool I have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_6812;I sank my eye into [drug_new_lover.GetHerHis]. I caught a glimpse of a deep dawn and saw the ancient yesterday and what I do not know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_68112;Praise be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] for opening my vision, it is so obvious to me now that [drug_plotter_reveal.GetTitledName] is having designs on my [drug_plotter_reveal.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCC_MNM_6810;In the darkness of my smoke-filled room, I wonder what the point of it all is. I was supposed to see Paradise. Instead I see the truth, and it has left me empty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_MNM_68112;I see now how our world is an intricate web of lies and plots, and it is thanks to the Order that I realized that [drug_plotter_reveal.GetTitledName] is planning to kill [drug_plotter_target.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCD_MNM_6810;By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap], they are everywhere. Hiding in every corner, nook and cranny. Flapping their wings and staring at us, trying to fool us that they are only around at night. I must tell my people what is going on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_MNM_68112;The herbs that the Order has made me realize how we all just desire things like rabid dogs. Like how I now see that [drug_plotter_reveal.GetTitledName] is trying to get [drug_plotter_reveal.GetHerHis] filthy paws on the [drug_plotter_reveal.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName] belonging to [drug_plotter_target.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
