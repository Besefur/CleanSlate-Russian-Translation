EVTDESCHFP20400;Pregnancies come with considerable risks. Now that I am with child I ought to appoint a regent who can take over if anything should happen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20404;As the time passes, I feel more and more restless. The changes in my body are constraining me, making hard what were simple actions once. It has been days since I have been out in the fields... This is all so frustrating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20405;My [GetFromRelation] seems to be going through a particularly harsh pregnancy. Perhaps it would be best for her to retire for a few months from public life and think of her health during this delicate period of her life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20408;Thankfully, my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and decided to spend the last months of her pregnancy in seclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20409;Thankfully, my [GetFromRelation] has taken my advice to heart and decided to spend the last months of her pregnancy away from court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20410;Unfortunately, my [GetFromRelation] has decided to ignore my advice and maintain a public presence even in her precarious state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20413;Curse them all! And the pox to this infernal piece of meat within me, stretching and destroying my body from the inside out! This is absolutely unbearable. I have snapped several times at my courtiers, even when I knew there was no good reason to do so, but I just cannot help it anymore! I want this to be over! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20414;It was only after the fifth course that I realized how much I had eaten last dinner. It has become so hard to tell when my body is already bloated, hosting a little insatiable pest. Perhaps I should stop bothering at all and just eat whenever I am hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20415;The maid apologized and tried to bring me back to my chambers, but I refused her hand and kept crying in the middle of the corridor until two servants dragged me to my private rooms. It is my fourth episode this week and I am not feeling like it will stop anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20416;Drinking a little every night has helped me a lot with relieving some of the tension I have been experiencing since the start of this pregnancy. I have started to feel a little dizzy in the past few days, but it is not like I have to do anything important in the next months anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20417;Just as I was finally being lulled into sleep by the slow rocking of the carriage, when the horses suddenly broke off the driver's control, sending my entire entourage charging out of the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20418;I thought being away from court and enjoying the clean air of the countryside would help me release some of the tension of this pregnancy, but it has only made things worse. My health is deteriorating by the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20419;I thought being away from court and enjoying the clean air of the countryside would help me release some of the tension of this pregnancy, but [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] had other plans in mind. [Root.GetWildernessWeather];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20420;I have just realized today that, even with the pregnancy finally being over, I have yet to stop my daily visits to the cellar. I should probably stop it, but, on the other hand, it *has* become some sort of tradition by now for me and many courtiers do agree I have had a sunnier disposition since I started doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20421;I thought that after the pregnancy I would go back being my usual self, but it seems I have gained a little weight. I am sure it is nothing to worry about, but still, reverting back to my old diet has not been as easy as I thought it would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20422;This is the ninth servant I disciplined this week. The poor boy did not even cry as the guards flogged him. Now, I do not even remember what was the reason I was mad at the boy in the first place. The realization shook me: my temper has gotten really out of hand, what if I unleash it on my newborn child?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20423;I have spent the last two days secluded in my chambers, refusing any food, too tired to move and too ailing to answer to any plead. I have given all myself to bring forth a new life into the world and now I feel empty, useless, discarded, alone. What was even the point of all that sufferance and anguish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20424;As days go by, I find harder and harder to ignore how my wife seems to have been letting herself go since her pregnancy, ravaging meal after meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20425;Outrageous! My spouse just had the nerve to tell me that I have put on too much weight and that I should start eating less, as if recovering from the pregnancy was not hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20426;Every night my wife keeps going down in the cellar, drinking herself to sleep. It was bad enough that she was doing it during the pregnancy, but I hoped she would have grown out of this bad habit by now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20427;My husband seems to have noticed my nightly visits to the cellar: this morning he voiced his concern about having a drunkard for a wife. He could have been a little more gentle about it after all I have been through in the last months...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20428;I hoped the solution would solve itself after the baby came out, but my wife's temper still remains a problem. I *could* try and tell her to calm a little, I suppose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20429;My spouse, he *dared* to say I have a temper problem! After all I have done!! After all I have been through! He *dares* to complain, as if he has any right! Maybe I have become a little touchy after all the pain and stress I was exposed to in the last months, but that is understandable! What is *his* excuse?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20430;It has been months since I saw my wife in a cheerful mood: she does not speak, she barely eats, never leaving her chambers unless she really has to. Every night I hear her crying in her sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20431;Today my husband talked a lot with me. Or rather to me, as I was not really in the mood for talking, myself. He was very gentle and tried to make me leave my room by inviting me to a private dinner. I do not know what to tell him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20432;My dear wife has finally listened to my advice. In a few weeks she might be back into shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20433;It seems my advice fell on deaf ears. Every day that passes by my wife keeps stuffing herself like a goose. So much for moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20434;I cannot remember the last time I saw my wife drunk. She has recovered from her bad habit quite nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20435;All my pleads have been for naught: my wife keeps sneaking out every night to drown her sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20436;Surprisingly, even if she yelled at me when I talked about it, my wife seems to have finally resolved her anger issues. She is treating everybody better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20437;Curses! I did not even manage to make my case: my wife just snapped at me and pushed me over the stairs. ...I think I broke something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20438;It is such a relief to see my wife alive again! I was really starting to worry, but she finally managed to recover from her depression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20439;I do not know what to do with my wife anymore: I can barely recognize her, all gloom and pale, she looks like a ghost. She has become completely unresponsive to everything and everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20440;A little sip here, a small bottle there, it might not be what is best for the child, but drinking more has definitely help me cope with the stress of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20441;I feel a lot less under pressure since I stopped caring about what I eat. In fact, I have started to routinely look forward to gorge myself on whatever the cooks have prepared every day. Besides, it is all to make a healthy son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20442;The pregnancy seem to be getting on my nerves. Lately I have been more and more irate, sometimes lashing out at the smallest thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20443;I do not know what day it is, or how long is left before this pregnancy is finally over. It feels as if I have always been in this bed. I cannot recall a single accomplishment of worth in my entire life. I feel hollow, worthless, and in constant pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20500;My health has quickly fallen in the last days to the point that I can no longer leave my bed. This pregnancy might be much more difficult than I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20502;In her current state [From.GetTitledFirstName] is almost entirely defenseless. Her pregnancy might present me with the perfect opportunity to get rid of her permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20538;Given the ominous circumstances of my birth, I am clearly no ordinary child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20539;The pregnancy has been a hellish torture, but its fruit at least seems to have been a strong and healthy baby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20540;As if the terrible pregnancy was not enough, there seems to be something wrong with my child as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20541;The pregnancy is over, but I have yet to leave my chambers, scourged by a steaming fever which is leaving me shivering and burning under my bedsheets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20542;As I turn restlessly in my bed, I find another curl of hair laying severed amongst the sheets. There is no doubt anymore that the strain my pregnancy put me under is resulting in an alarming loss of hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20543;My bleeding has yet to stop. Even with the child out, I am still experiencing frequent accesses, despite the best efforts of my healers to stop the flow of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20544;The horrific trial is finally over: I have fully recovered from the ordeal that was this pregnancy without any lasting scar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20545;I am finally starting to recover from the ordeal of this labor, but there is no doubt that this experience has considerably weakened me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20546;Although my body is recovering from the pregnancy, the pain I endured has deeply scarred my mind. Every little sound puts me on alert and it is harder and harder to find the resolve to go outside of my room, even to perform the simplest task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20547;I hoped the pain would be over with the child out of me, but the internal bleeding I have suffered by giving birth to [From.GetHerHim] has made everything worse. As I lay in my blood-soaked bed, the servant desperately try to preserve what little spark of life I have left as I slowly slip into unconsciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20548;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor, but she seems to have miraculously recovered from it without any permanent damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20549;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor and, while she managed to survive it, she has been left weakened and fragile after the ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20550;My wife [From.GetFirstName] went through an extremely painful and dangerous labor and, while her body managed to survive largely unscathed, her mind was unfortunately shattered by the hellish experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20551;My wife [From.GetFirstName] did not survive her pregnancy, dying of complications during her labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20406;My dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is worried about my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] believes it might be better for me to retire from public life for the duration of this pregnancy. I can leave someone else in charge of affairs as I tend to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20407;This pregnancy is becoming a greater burden than I initially imagined. If I am not careful about my health, I may risk both my life as well as the child's. Perhaps I should take leave and spend the rest of the pregnancy in reclusion, looking after myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20501;Your wife's pregnancy is not going well at all. She can no longer leave her bed and has been barely conscious during the past few days. If she is not properly treated, she may well not survive the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw the golden gates of Heavens before me. A creature of light flew over them, blowing in his horn to let me in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw a golden child fly before me, spreading his wings to welcome me in his embrace. Yet, my relief turned to horror as I realized his robes were covered in filth, and snakes were nesting among his curls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20505;Worrying for my precarious state, my [GetFromRelation] decided to send [From.GetHerHis] best physician to help me through the last months of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20506;Worrying for my precarious state, my [GetFromRelation] decided to offer [From.GetHerHis] own skills as physician to help me through the last months of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20507;[From.GetFirstName] has welcomed my physician to her bedchambers. Hopefully things will improve from today forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20508;[From.GetFirstName]'s stubbornness knows no bounds: as she lays feverish in her bed, still she refuses my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20509;My [GetFromRelation] has sent a priest to my bedchambers to help and comfort me with his prayers. Hopefully his words will bring me some comfort during my labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20510;My [GetFromRelation] has sent a shaman to my bedchambers to perform the proper rites and scare away any evil spirits that might be the cause for my current predicament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20511;The chalice slips from my fingers as my vision starts to go blurry. Usually it takes me longer to fall asleep, but tonight I really cannot keep my eyes open. Only when I start choking and spot my regent, peeking from the door with a leering look, I finally understand what has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20512;My plan worked and [From.GetTitledFirstName] choked on her own blood. I doubt anybody will suspect the cause for her untimely death to be anything but complications during her difficult pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20513;It takes me some time to react to the sudden pressure on my face: I had just finally managed to fall asleep after a long, painful night of cramps and nightmares. When I finally gained full conscience I find myself with only little air left. I struggle for a few seconds, trying to push the pillow away or grab my assassin's arms, but it is all in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20514;I waited until [From.GetTitledFirstName] fell asleep, snuck inside her room and pushed a pillow over her face. She barely put up any fight and, after a few minutes, she stopped struggling entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20515;I was about to drink my usual glass of wine to help me sleep, when a sudden retching forced me to hold it away for a moment. As I picked the glass once more, I noticed a strange smell coming from the wine. Just then, in my hesitation, I glimpsed at the reflection of my Regent [From.GetFirstName], ominously spying on me from my chamber's door with expectation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20516;My plan did not work: [From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow managed to discover my plot to kill her moments before I set the plan in motion. She steadily screamed for help and her personal guards came in to arrest me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20517;My plan did not work: [From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow managed to discover my plot to kill her moments before I set the plan in motion. She steadily screamed for help and her personal guards came in to kill me on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20518;I was hoping that I could finally have a night with a peaceful sleep when the contents of my stomach decided to strongly disagree. I was just about to stand up when I heard a rustle near my bed: I slowly opened my eyes to see [From.GetFirstName] standing beside me, holding a pillow over my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20519;[From.GetFirstName] promised that [From.GetSheHe] will visit me every day until my labor comes to term to offer me all [From.GetHerHis] support and [From.GetHerHis] prayer for a speedy recovery and a healthy childbirth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20520;I cannot stand up, I cannot lay down, even the gentler action sends shivers of pain through my body. If I do not do something about it, this pregnancy might be the end of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20522;I turn again and again under my bedsheets, panting desperately for air. My throat has become dry and hoarse, making it even harder to breathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20523;The servants take away the last bucket filled with my vomit, but they are not fast enough to place the new one under my face. As I puke all over my bed, the stench provokes a new surge of nausea, making me shiver violently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20524;I tear off another bush of hair from my chest, trying to stop myself from scratching my arms and legs some more. Despite my best efforts to stop it, since a few days now dozens of rashes and spots of disgusting fur have started to dot my skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20525;I spit out the glass of water, and order one of my servants to try it again. As the pregnancy progressed, everything has started to taste progressively worse, to the point that now even the blandest of foods and beverages feel like rusted copper in my mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20526;I feel the touch of the servants covering me yet another time as I stir under my bedsheets, sweating and shivering. I have long since lost the sense of time since this fever has started tormenting me. In fact, I can barely tell if I am awake or not most of the times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20527;As I spend more days wasting away in my bedroom, tormented by this pregnancy, I am finding it a lot harder to focus on anything. Things that I thought obvious now slip away from my mind, and I can hardly remember the names of half the people I seen moving back and forth from my rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20528;Once again, I wake in the dead of night, covered in cold sweat, with my heart beating wildly and struggling to breathe. My throat is already sore, but I still manage to scream my lungs out for help. When the guards finally come in, it takes them some time to stop me from screaming entirely and to assure me that there is nothing I should be worrying about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20529;One of my servants hangs a dish filled with yet another delicacy below my nose, but I quickly push it aside in disgust. I have barely the strength left to breathe, let alone to chew anything, and the growing cramps from your womb are making me feel nauseous at every turn, so much so that has become really hard for me to eat anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20530;I stir and drool, twisting uncontrollably in my bed, despite my servants' best efforts to hold me still. I hear voices, both worried and threatening, echo around me, but everything is blurry and I have no idea what is happening to me, nor why I am unable to stop screaming and foaming at the mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20531;The servants come once more to change the bedsheets soaked in my blood as I scream and fruitlessly grasp for something to hold onto as I try to ease the pain that coursing through every fiber of my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20532;I let out a whimper when the tooth rolls over my bedsheets, and then moan through my closed mouth as I feel the metallic taste of blood fill my throat and more teeth loosen from my weakened gums.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20533;Yet another servant girls falls asleep in the middle of her story as I keep staring at her, teeming with envy. It has been almost a week since I last managed to sleep properly. My eyes are bloodshot and my ears scream in pain at even the softest whisper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20534;Some of the servants seem to have been really started to worry about me since a few weeks, but in truth, I have not felt this good since quite some time, especially after since the talking fox brought some of his friends in my bedchamber to entertain me with their delightful escapades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20535;I startle as a pair of hands drags me back from the edge of the balcony. How did I even get here? The last thing I recall was trying to find the right position to sleep without squashing my womb...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20536;Things seem to be finally improving. I have resumed to sleep and eat regularly and the cramps have subsided. I may be able to see this labor to its end after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20537;The servants are working tirelessly around me, changing bloodied bedsheets and brushing blood and sweat off of me, but there seems to be no end to it. The bleeding will not stop and I am too weak to endure any more pain and deprivation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20552;The nightmare is not over yet for my wife: her recovery was only passing, her conditions have quickly worsened after giving birth to her child. If she does not get better soon, she will surely perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20553;My treatment is finally showing some results: my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is sleeping and eating regularly again, and her cramps have subsidized. The pregnancy is not over yet, but she might be able to make it after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20554;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is sleeping and eating regularly again, and she claims to be feeling better. The pregnancy is not over yet, but she might be able to make it after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20557;This is going to be my first child, and I feel completely lost. What if I am doing something wrong? What if something bad happens? What should I do while I wait for the day of my labor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20558;Ouch! As I place a hand over my belly and slowly sit down, a soft smile makes its way across my face. The baby is kicking again. I wonder if he will grow up to be a warrior...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20559;Today, as I was laying down, gently caressing my stomach and looking out my bedroom's window, I started to wonder what will my next child be. It would be nice to finally give birth to a boy, after all this time, and make sure my dynasty has a proper heir...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20560;What a bother! The number of good dresses that I am still able to wear is growing increasingly smaller as my pregnancy takes its course. Perhaps I should order new clothes to be tailored on my current measurements...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20561;My wife [From.GetFirstName] asked me to buy her some new clothes. Because of the pregnancy, she has outgrown most of her wardrobe and now she feels frustrated for not having anything nice to wear whenever she needs to make an appearance at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20562;[From.GetFirstName] convinced me that I do not need any new fancy clothes when I am already positively glowing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20563;[From.GetFirstName] was happy to buy me new clothes. Being able to wear something that is both nice and comfortable has certainly improved my disposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20564;Unbelievable! [From.GetFirstName] refused to buy me new clothes! Am I not already under enough stress as it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20565;At first the signs were small, easily dismissed as coincidences, but now they are becoming too frequent to be ignored: I will give birth under auspicious stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20566;At first the signs were small, easily dismissed as coincidences, but now they are becoming too frequent to be ignored: my wife will give birth under auspicious stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20567;At first the signs were small, easily dismissed as coincidences, but now they are becoming too frequent to be ignored: the omens surrounding my pregnancy are terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20568;At first the signs were small, easily dismissed as coincidences, but now they are becoming too frequent to be ignored: the omens surrounding my wife's pregnancy are terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20569;I am uncertain about my future and I cannot stop worrying about the life of my unborn child. Perhaps I should make a vow to the Holy Virgin Mary, and pray her to ease my tribulations and help me give birth to a strong and healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20570;The statue of the Holy Virgin stands over the chapel's alcove, the divine child resting on her arm. I kneel before it and look up at her somber smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20571;I cannot stop worrying about my unborn child. Perhaps I should make a personal offering to the old gods and placate their thirst for blood so that they in turn may spare the life of my unborn child as well as mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20572;As the smoke of my offering rises to the sky, I can almost hear the faint whispers of the gods traveling through the wind. I have called the attention of the immortals, it is now time to make my request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20573;Ugh, the child is in the mood for something different today. What should I eat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20574;Mother is not feeling well. The baby in her belly is unruly and she is gloomy all the time. Maybe I should go cheer her up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20575;I can only imagine how [From.GetFirstName] must feel – as if being unable to publicly declare our feelings for each other was not enough, she now must lie about the fruit of our love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20576;I was very surprised to find my husband waiting for me in my rooms tonight, surrounded by an entire collection of assorted presents. Apparently, he just wants to give me his best wishes for the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20577;[From.GetFirstName] was extremely happy about the presents I bought for her. Right after seeing me, she jumped into my arms and gave me a passionate kiss. It looks like my kind gesture has really struck her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20578;[From.GetFirstName] decided to come visit me. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried about my health, and so decided to spend the entire afternoon trying to cheer me up, asking questions about [From.GetHerHis] future brother, touching my belly, and trying to hear the baby inside. [From.GetSheHeCap] is such a sweet child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20579;I was right to go to Mother. She was much happier after I talked to her. She even told me I will be a great [Root.GetSisterBrother] for the new child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20580;When I discovered [From.GetFirstName] lurking in my chambers I barely managed to restrain myself from screaming and accidentally call the guards on [From.GetHerHim]. My lover told me that [From.GetSheHe] wished to comfort me in this stressful period of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20581;The baby is finally out, and I can sleep easily once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20582;My little [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a very talkative and cheerful [From.GetBoyGirl]. If only it weren't for that twisted foot of [From.GetHerHis]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20583;My little [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a silent [From.GetBoyGirl]. I worry that [From.GetSheHe] might be having a harder time learning to talk because of that harelip of [From.GetHersHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20584;My little [From.GetFirstName] may not be the cutest of children, but [From.GetSheHe] certainly has a very curious and inquisitive mind behind [From.GetHerHis] plain face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20585;It looks like all that time kicking in my belly was not just for show: my sweet [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a fierce and healthy [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20586;The gods are truly generous! My sacrifice was not in vain: [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a healthy and strong [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20587;The gods are truly generous! My sacrifice was not in vain: [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a healthy and beautiful [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20588;The gods are truly generous! My sacrifice was not in vain: [From.GetFirstName] is growing into a healthy and bright [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20589;My prayers have been answered! The seed planted within me was indeed that of a wonderful [From.GetBoyGirl], just as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20590;The vow I made was not in vain. The Holy Virgin has blessed me with a healthy, strong [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20591;As soon as I broke my vow, my poor child's health started to drop. It is only because of my sins that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] now suffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20594;I never knew how terrible it was for my mother to give birth to me until a few years ago, and only now I am starting to truly understand the deadly danger she put herself through in order to bring me into this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20595;Today [From.GetFirstName] decided to talk to me about [From.GetHerHis] birth. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] did not understand until very recently just how close I was to die when giving birth to [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] wished to openly show [From.GetHerHis] appreciation for my care and endurance, both during the labor and in the years following it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20596;The pregnancy has caused my wife to develop quite the unusual tastes. Most of what she asks for dinner nowadays ranges from mildly unsettling to positively revolting. Still, scholars do agree that a pregnant woman's cravings should always be accommodated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20598;As I hold little [From.GetFirstName] in my arms, I cannot stop myself from thinking what will ever be the place for the Pope's [From.GetSonDaughter] in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20599;[From.GetFirstName] sleeps safely in my arms. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks so sweet and innocent, the first days after the pregnancy was over I could not be parted from [From.GetHerHim], but I am starting to feel the weight of my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] pulling me away from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPB20406;My Court Physician is worried about my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] has advised me to retire from public life for the duration of this pregnancy. I can leave someone else in charge of affairs as I tend to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20424;Even now that the pregnancy is over, my wife's cravings for exotic foods have yet to stop. I am starting to think she is just taking advantage of my generosity to grow fat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20501;Your [GetFromRelation]'s health has experienced a sudden drop during the last week. If she is not properly treated, she may well not survive the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I saw the heavenly palace of Asgard and the battling fields of Valhalla where heroes of old were fighting against each other and alongside the mighty Aesirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, the fiery pits of perdition opened below me, letting a host of horrid jinns emerge to crawl over my flesh and froth at my face with their boiling spits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20507;[From.GetFirstName] has welcomed my offer to help her with her labor. Hopefully I will be able to save her as well as our child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20552;Labor is not going well. My wife is bleeding profusely and seems to be suffering great pains. If the bleeding does not stop soon she will surely perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20559;Today, as I was laying down, gently caressing my stomach and looking out my bedroom's window, I started to wonder what will my next child be. It would be nice to finally give birth to a girl, after all this time, and make sure my dynasty has a proper heir...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20574;My mother has not been feeling well lately. Going through a pregnancy is no easy task. Perhaps I should visit her and try to cheer her up a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20575;I can only imagine how [From.GetFirstName] must feel – as if being unable to publicly declare our feelings for each other was not enough, she now has to carry a child against her will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20578;[From.GetFirstName] decided to come visit me. [From.GetSheHeCap] worries about my health and wished to offer [From.GetHerHis] sympathies for my current condition. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is quite eager to meet [From.GetHerHis] new baby brother or sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20579;I was right to visit my [GetFromRelation]. She is feeling much better now. Hopefully what I did will help her get through this pregnancy more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20589;It looks as my prayers went unanswered. I was truly hoping to have something better than a [From.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20590;Perhaps I was not virtuous enough to gain the favor of the Holy Virgin: my vow did not help little [From.GetFirstName] to be born in good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20599;At first I may have been uncertain about this pregnancy, but after all the pain and tribulation, looking at the sweet, innocent creature resting in my arms fills my heart with joy. The maids insist that I should leave [From.GetHerHim] in their care now, go back to my duties as [Root.GetTitle]. Perhaps they are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPC20503;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I found myself riding over the vast planes. Then, suddenly, my horse left the ground and rose up, bringing me closer and closer to the ethereal clouds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I found myself in a dark and frozen cave. A sleek man was bound to a rock in its darkest recess, screaming and crying as two snakes were dropping poison in his eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20559;Today, as I was laying down, gently caressing my stomach and looking out my bedroom's window, I started to wonder what will my next child be: am I carrying a boy or a girl?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20574;It occurred to me that my wife is feeling somewhat gloomy as of late. The burden of her unborn child is surely causing some humoral unbalance that is affecting her mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20578;My beloved husband decided to pay me a visit tonight. We have not had a lot of time to be together since the pregnancy started showing, so it was a much welcome surprise for me to meet him in private again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20590;The Holy Virgin has turned her gaze away from me. Why else would she let my poor innocent child die before [From.GetSheHe] could even be baptized?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20599;This pregnancy was far from easy. [From.GetFirstName] rests happily in my arms, unaware of all the tears and pain [From.GetSheHe] has put me through. I am starting to wonder if the circumstances of [From.GetHerHis] birth will make it harder for me to love [From.GetHerHim] as I should...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPD20504;As I struggled in my bed, burned by the fever, I felt as if somebody was dragging me below the ground itself, to be crushed and suffocate under dirt and ashes. The grotesque spawns of Elrik then crawled beside me, crying and gnawing at my limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20574;Whether it's guilt for her vile betrayal, or simply an humoral unbalance brought by her pregnancy, my wife has looked quite gloomy as of late. Perhaps she has finally started to understand the gravity of her crime against me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20599;Even after all the pain, all the hours spent screaming and praying, when I look down at the little miracle resting safely within my arms, I cannot find it in my heart to hold a grudge towards my child. How is [From.GetSheHe] responsible for the ill circumstances of [From.GetHerHis] birth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOOLTIPAHFP20501;Tell your wife that your Court Physician will take care of her in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPAHFP20502;Attempt to poison §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPBHFP20501;Tell your wife that you will put your skills as a Scholar to good use to help her in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPBHFP20502;Attempt to suffocate §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPCHFP20501;Send a priest to comfort your wife in her time of need and pray for the salvation of her soul should the worst come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPDHFP20501;Send a shaman to comfort your wife and cast the proper spells to facilitate her labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOOLTIPEHFP20501;Offer to comfort your wife in her time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20400;I will think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20404;I must endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20405;I will tell my [GetFromRelation] to take leave for the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20406;It sounds like a great idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20407;Sounds like a great idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20408;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20409;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20410;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20413;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20414;I am eating for two after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20415;Yet, how inspiring my tribulation is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20416;I will ask the servants for another round before going to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20417;I will calm them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20418;It is just some travel nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20419;I will not let a simple storm break me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20420;No excuses: I cannot go on like this. I have to stop drinking so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20421;I should try to eat more moderately now that I have no child to sustain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20422;I really have an anger issue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20423;I cannot simply give up now. I have a child to look after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20424;She might use a little moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20424_B;I think you have had enough, dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20425;He *is* right after all. I should try harder to stop eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20426;Maybe she needs a little more encouragement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20427;He is right! This behavior is unbecoming of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20428;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20429;Hm... Perhaps I *do* have a temper problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20430;I cannot bear to see her this way. I should talk to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20431;I have suffered enough, perhaps this is my chance to live again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20432;Good for her. And me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20433;Ugh, we will need a larger bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20434;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20435;I do not know what else to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20436;Hopefully this will last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20437;At least I am out of reach, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20438;Now if only she could stop talking for once in awhile...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20439;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20440;I am not drinking *that* much anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20441;I will stop the moment the little thing is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20442;I am surrounded by idiots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20443;I am truly pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20500;Oh, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20501;My Court Physician will know how to help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20502;A nice poison will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20503;Help me through this, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20504;Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20505;All aid is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20506;All aid is welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20507;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20508;I can only pray now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20509;Pray for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20510;Protect me, o wise one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20511;You...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20512;She is finally at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20513;Hmmmmnngfhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20514;She is finally at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20515;Guards! Seize [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHFPA20516;No, wait, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHFPA20517;No, wait, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20518;Guards! Seize [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20519;That is really kind of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20520;I will call for my Court Physician.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20522;I am suffocating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20523;Ugh... When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20524;This is horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20525;Utterly repulsive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20526;Where..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20527;Who are you again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20528;But I saw something! I saw..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20529;I just wish to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20530;Ghgghghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20531;Let it stop! Please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20532;Gllkh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20533;I just want to rest! Even just an hour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20534;Oh, Lord Butterfly, you are such a braggart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20535;Who..? Who are you? Where am I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20536;Hopefully the worst has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20537;I cannot-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20538;Guh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20539;My child...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20540;Am I cursed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20541;When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20542;What is happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20543;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20544;I am a little bit tired still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20545;I might not survive another labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20546;I am so tired and- what was it again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20547;It is over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20548;This is wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20549;Is the womb still in working condition though?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20550;At least the body is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20551;At least she is at peace now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20552;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20553;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20554;This is wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20557;I need to pray for my child's good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20558;I am sure I am carrying a fierce little soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20559;I sure hope it is a boy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20560;Maybe if I ate less I could still wear some of my old dresses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20561;My dear, you do not need new clothes. You are already wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20562;Oh you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20563;I feel much better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20564;He never thinks about how I feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20565;I must be sure to interpret all signs correctly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20566;Hopefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20567;Maybe I am misinterpreting the signs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20568;I am sure I am misinterpreting the signs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20569;I must do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20570;I vow to be chaste and virtuous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20571;I will make an offering to the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20572;Gods! Grant me a strong and healthy child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20573;It does not matter 'what' as long as it is a LOT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20574;I will buy her something nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20575;I must visit her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20576;Oh, dear, you really *do* love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20577;I love you too, dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20578;You are going to be a wonderful big [From.GetSisterBrother], [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20579;I hoe you are well, Mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20580;I am so glad you came!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20581;I feel liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20582;I wonder what caused it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20583;I wonder what caused it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20584;I wonder who [From.GetSheHe] took after...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20585;I am so proud of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20586;Thank you, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20587;Thank you, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20588;Thank you, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20589;My beautiful [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20590;I must still keep true to my vow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20591;What have I done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20594;I must talk to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20596;I will make sure that she gets all she wants and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20599;I will always be with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP20400;I know just the person fit for the job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20405;She can think for herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20406;I'd better leave the [Root.GetHouse] entirely then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20407;I'd better leave the [Root.GetHouse] entirely then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20413;Perhaps I should try to calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20414;I should still try to use moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20415;I am a horrible person and a shame to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20416;This is really irresponsible of me, I should stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20417;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20418;My physician will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20419;I cannot stand this anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20420;I have survived a difficult labor: a little sip here and there won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20421;What is wrong with a little indulging?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20422;That will not be *my* problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20423;There is no point in going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20424;She can take care of herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20425;Fat?! I will show him fat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20426;There is nothing wrong in having a little bottle once in a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20427;He should learn to enjoy himself a little and stop patronizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20428;No, I am not feeling suicidal today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20429;*Now* I really am angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20430;I really cannot stand her incessant moaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20431;I want nothing! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20501;I am as good as any Physician. I will help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20502;I will simply smother her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20503;Is it my fate to join them already?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20504;Leave me be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20505;I do not want a charlatan poisoning me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20506;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no expert in these matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20515;Guards! Kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20518;Guards! Kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20520;I need to hire a healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20557;I need to rest and avoid any hard task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20558;Dear [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I need a rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20559;I sure hope it is a girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20560;I will have [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] buy me new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20561;Very well, summon the tailor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20565;I am surely blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20567;I am surely cursed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20568_A;My poor [From.GetFirstName]! What am I going to do now!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20568_B;Hopefully they are just coincidences...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20569;I do not need to concern the Holy Virgin with my troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20570;I vow to be humble and set aside all frivolous things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20571;It would be too dangerous to go out alone in my condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20572;Gods! I only hope to have a beautiful and healthy child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20573;I wonder what a quail's foot tastes like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20574;I will go spend some time with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20575;It would be too dangerous right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20576;Thank you, I really appreciate your gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20578;Thank you for your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20589;And yet, I still love [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20590;I think it is time to turn my mind back to mundane concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20594;I think she already knows how I feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20595;It is very kind of you to say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20596;Are you sure you do not mean a quail's *leg*, dear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20598;I am sure there are great things in store for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20599;Time to go to the wet-nurses, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20406;Nonsense, I feel perfectly fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20407;Nonsense, I feel perfectly fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20418;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s Physician will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20501;She needs a priest to pray for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20502;No need to worry: she probably will die on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20503;The Great Blue Sky protects me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20504;I will not be trapped here forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20520;I need a priest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20557;I need to find something to distract myself from this burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20559;It does not really matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20560;I really need to order new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20561;Why? So that she can throw them away a few months from now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20570;I vow to be charitable and take care of the needy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20572;Gods! I wish for my child to be bright and healthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20573;I am really feeling hungry for hare's head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20574;I am sure she will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20574_B;Too late to feel sorry now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20589;I will just have to wait a little more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20590;What have I done to offend you, Mother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20596;Wh- a hare's head?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20599;I cannot stand [From.GetHerHis] sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP20418;Why is this happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20501;She needs a shaman to protect her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20504;Let me out! I cannot breathe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20520;A shaman will exorcise the evil spirits plaguing me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20560;No need to go through all this trouble for some dress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20570;I vow to be temperate and avoid all excesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20573;I want a trout's eye! NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20596;Ugh! Why on Earth would you want a fish's eye?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHFP20501;The only thing she needs is me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20520;I can do this on my own, I just need to endure the pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20573;I will ask my husband about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20596;I have no money to spend on this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHFP20501;She will manage on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHFP20404;This child is not worth my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHFP20424;After [From.GetHerHis] labor, I think [From.GetSheHe] deserves a treat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHFP20430;Solace in solitude is what [From.GetSheHe] requires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPC20003;Smoother skin, shining eyes, fuller curves... I was never much of a looker, but the changes brought by this pregnancy have turned me into a much prettier woman than I thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20004;I could scarcely believe it possible, but the pregnancy has managed to make my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] look passable. I have found myself strangely attracted to her since a few weeks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20015;I must be really trustworthy for [From.GetFirstName] to open herself so much when talking to me... Or perhaps it is just the baby in her belly loosening her tongue. I can barely keep up with her gossiping, but speaking so much and about so many different subjects is helping me almost as much as it does her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20020;As I took the communion from the priest's hand, a sense of uneasiness filled my heart. Something is weighing on my soul, preventing me to find peace in the Lord's embrace, tormenting my mind with doubts and impure thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20021;As is tradition, my wife [From.GetFirstName] underwent her churching after recovering and cleansing herself from the recent pregnancy. Unfortunately, her mood was not improved by taking the holy communion. Perhaps some old sin is still weighing on her soul...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20054;My wife could have not been a more appropriate choice for this year's festival. She is a model of modesty and pious conduct. Hopefully her actions will both help her deliver a strong child as well as spread the goddess' blessing across my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20059;It is time for the adults to start fear me as well as other kids have always done. Under my quiet and frail demeanor I have ironed I ruthless mind, and now I have finally the power and maturity to put it to use for my own benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC20060;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has always been a frail and quiet kid. Unfortunately, it has long become apparent to me that beyond [From.GetHerHis] silence and [From.GetHerHis] scrawny body lays a vicious and ruthless spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPC30032;It wasn't hard to realize that my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is left-handed like me. I am wondering now whether it wouldn't be better if I corrected this behavior in the child before it becomes permanent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20015;I have tried my best to divert the conversation of our gossiping group to more interesting matters, to learn more about my friends and relatives, but [From.GetFirstName] is much better at this than I am, unfortunately. I was entirely unable to gather any useful information with my prodding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20020;As I try to swallow the communion, a surge of nausea fills my body. I fall to the ground, and, taken by panic, I start coughing madly. It takes some time for me to retake my senses, and when I do, the priests surrounding me tell me that, while I was choking on the flesh of Christ, I called out the name of the real father of my newborn child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20021;As is tradition, my wife [From.GetFirstName] underwent her churching after recovering and cleansing herself from the recent pregnancy. Unfortunately, the unthinkable happened: [From.GetFirstName] nearly choked on the holy communion. The officiant priest swears that, in the subsequent delirium, the Lord compelled her to confess to her adultery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPD20054;My wife has really taken on her role as [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the festival. She acts as imperious as any goddess would. Her behavior might be a bit out of place, but at least she is having fun and she is administering the rites properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPE20015;I might have spoiled [From.GetFirstName]'s peace of mind, but taking over the conversation is really helping me learn more about my family's secrets. The venomous gaze of my [GetFromRelation] is a small price to pay for my success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPE20054;My wife has really taken on her role as [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the festival. She acts as imperious as any goddess would. I just hope all of these special attentions will not inflate her ego to the point of making her inadvertently offend [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] herself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPF20015;I might have spoiled [From.GetFirstName]'s peace of mind, but taking over the conversation is really helping me learn more about my family's secrets. The poor sight of [From.GetFirstName] waiting silently with her head down is a small price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPF20054;My wife has really taken on her role as [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the festival. She acts as imperious as any goddess would. She is certainly having her fun administering blessings, but her demeanor is always collected and sophisticated. I am sure her actions will bring prestige to our family name, as well as the favor of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPG20015;I really wish to help [From.GetFirstName] be as comfortable as possible during this delicate period of her life. Yet, despite looking genuinely thankful for my concern, my [GetFromRelation] still insists to do everything on her own, and be content with enjoying my company only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPG20054;My wife could have not been a more appropriate choice for this year's festival. She is the spitting image of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess], and all the peasants love her. If nothing else, this ceremony has certainly helped improve the spirit of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPH20015;Thanks to our concerted efforts, [From.GetFirstName] already looks more relaxed. We visit her almost every afternoon and make sure that her every need is tended to. Hopefully all this care will help her deliver a strong and healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPH20054;My wife could have not been a more appropriate choice for this year's festival. She is the spitting image of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess], and many of my vassals have taken a liking to her collected and pious conduct during the course of the ceremony. I have received quite a few compliments for choosing such a wise woman to be my wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPI20015;Thanks to our concerted efforts, [From.GetFirstName] already looks more relaxed. We visit her almost every afternoon and make sure to satisfy every craving that the baby puts into her mind. Hopefully all this care will help her deliver a strong and healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPI20054;My wife is certainly having her fun taking on the role of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]. Everybody seems to like her, and she has wasted no time hoarding all the food offerings made to the goddess for herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPL20054;My wife is certainly having her fun taking on the role of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]. Everybody seems to like her, though I am worrying a bit about how frequently she is accepting cider from her petitioners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPM20054;My wife could have not been a more appropriate choice for this year's festival. She is a model of modesty and pious conduct. Hopefully her actions will both help her deliver a strong child as well as spread the goddess' blessing across my land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPN20054;My wife might have taken her role as goddess of fertility for the harvest festival a bit too literally. While she has undoubtedly enjoyed the celebration and earned the praise from peasants and nobles alike, I have received some disturbing rumors about her granting suspiciously private audiences to the prettiest petitioners in her crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPB20000;"Father! Father!" calls [From.GetFirstName], pulling my arm, pleading to play with [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] latest toy, completely oblivious to all the important work I am in the middle of. Yet, how could I say no to such a sweet, innocent exuberance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20001;My poor [From.GetFirstName] is so unresponsive, so slow to learn the most basic things... Sometimes I wonder if smoking so much while I was carrying [From.GetHerHim] has had a bad effect on [From.GetHerHis] health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20002;My poor [From.GetFirstName] is so unresponsive, so slow to learn the most basic things... Sometimes I wonder if [From.GetHerHis] slow mind is a result of [From.GetHerHis] mother smoking so much while she was carrying [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20003;Smoother skin, shining eyes, fuller curves... The changes brought by this pregnancy have made me more beautiful than I ever was in my entire life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20004;I could scarcely believe it, but the pregnancy has made my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] look more beautiful than she ever was. Whenever we are in the same room I can hardly take my eyes off her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20006;[From.GetFirstName] has enlisted the help of some of the women from our staff to cheer me up and keep my mind off the pregnancy while I wait for the child to be born. If nothing else, it will be nice to have somebody to talk to when I am not dealing with my duties as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20015;[From.GetFirstName] is even more talkative than I am! I can barely keep up with her gossiping, yet speaking so much and about so many different subjects is helping me almost as much as it does her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20020;I took the communion from the priest's hand and a warm sense of bliss filled my heart. I feel whole and at peace once again, ready to put the pain and unclean memories of my labor behind, and move forward with my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20021;As is tradition, my wife [From.GetFirstName] underwent her churching after recovering and cleansing herself from the recent pregnancy. She felt much better when she returned, clearly relieved to have fully rejoined the Church after her forced abstinence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20028;The vision my wife had at her churching all those years ago was correct. [From.GetFirstName] is growing into an amazing [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20030;This pregnancy has made my wife [From.GetFirstName] much more talkative and cheerful than usual. She never misses the chance to chat with anybody within earshot. Unfortunately, most scholars agree that a pregnant woman should spend as much time as possible resting in a dark room to avoid giving birth to a sickly child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20054;My wife could have not been a more appropriate choice for this year's festival. She is as gentle and caring when giving blessings to my subjects as [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] herself. Hopefully her actions will both help her deliver a strong child as well as spread the goddess' blessing across my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20055;[From.GetFirstName] grows more beautiful every day. I had my doubts at first, but now I cannot deny it any longer: the child is surely blessed. When my wife played [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the festival, the goddess must have touched the child within her and gifted her with her beauty and purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20056;My poor, sweet [From.GetFirstName] is dead. She resisted for as long as she could, but she was unable to survive her labor. She sacrificed herself so that a little, pale fiend could come out of her womb, so sickly and skeletal that the midwives are scared to hold it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20059;I have always been too weak for any sort of manual labor, but being able to focus on my mind since my earlier years has allowed me to learn a lot more than most kids do by my age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20060;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has always been a frail and quiet kid. [From.GetHerHisCap] body is not meant for manual labor, and is voice barely goes beyond a whisper, but [From.GetHerHis] mind is a boiling cauldron of ideas, restlessly working to explore the darkest subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20061;I have just discovered something terrible! Rather than risk her life in a difficult pregnancy, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to kill the child growing in her womb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB20067;I have received news that my lover [From.GetFirstName] is with child. Hopefully she will be able to persuade her husband to be the real father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPA20000;"Father! Father!" calls [From.GetFirstName], pulling my arm, pleading to play with [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] latest toy, completely oblivious to all the important work I am in the middle of. Sometimes this kid can really be insufferable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20001;My poor [From.GetFirstName] is so unresponsive, so slow to learn the most basic things... Sometimes I wonder if drinking so much while I was carrying [From.GetHerHim] has had a bad effect on [From.GetHerHis] health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20002;My poor [From.GetFirstName] is so unresponsive, so slow to learn the most basic things... Sometimes I wonder if [From.GetHerHis] slow mind is a result of [From.GetHerHis] mother drinking so much while she was carrying [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20003;Smoother skin, shining eyes, fuller curves... The changes brought by this pregnancy have made me even more beautiful than I already was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20004;I could scarcely believe it possible, but the pregnancy has made my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] look even more beautiful than she already was. Whenever we are in the same room I can hardly take my eyes off her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20005;It is good tradition to have some gossips around a pregnant woman in order to keep her calm and distracted from the tribulations of this delicate time in her life. As [From.GetFirstName]'s husband, it is my duty to provide her with the support she needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20006;[From.GetFirstName] has enlisted the help of some of the women in our family to cheer me up and keep my mind off the pregnancy while I wait for the child to be born. If nothing else, it will be nice to have somebody to talk to when I am not dealing with my duties as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20007;I cover my mouth and try to contain a giggle. Spotting a servant discreetly lighting up a candle, I realize that it's night already. This isn't the first time I spend my entire afternoon gossiping about friends and family with my guests without even realizing it, but I cannot deny that this new habit is really helping me getting through the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20008;I thought I would enjoy the gossips provided by my husband, but this has been far from the case: these cackling harpies barely give me the chance to talk at all, and seem more interested in blathering on and on about their own petty concerns rather than making me feel better during this delicate time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20009;One of the maids helps me sit down, gently taking a feel of my belly and asking me if I am comfortable enough. Another servant encouragingly holds a spoonful of soup close to my mouth. All this pampering from my gossips is really spoiling me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20010;My [GetFromRelation] has asked me to spend some time with [From.GetHerHis] wife, as is tradition, hoping it will put her mind at ease as the day of her labor draws near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20011;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s [FromFromFrom.GetHouse] is filled with relatives and maids, all surrounding the pregnant woman, gossiping and tending to her needs. Overall, it's a very lively and cheerful pastime, even though more often than not the topics of conversation are beyond frivolous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20012;I cover my mouth and try to contain a giggle at [From.GetFirstName]'s joke. Spotting a servant discreetly lighting up a candle, I realize that it's night already. This isn't the first time I spend my entire afternoon gossiping about friends and family with my relatives without even realizing it, but I cannot deny that this new habit is really helping me getting through the pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20013;I thought I would enjoy the gossips provided by my husband, but this has been far from the case: [From.GetFirstName] and her host of cackling harpies barely give me the chance to talk at all, and seem more interested in blathering on and on about their own petty concerns rather than making me feel better during this delicate time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20014;[From.GetFirstName] helps me sit down, and stroking my belly gently [From.GetSheHe] asks "are you certain that you are comfortable enough?" Meanwhile, a servant next to her holds a spoonful of soup to my mouth, encouraging me to take another bite. All this pampering from my gossips is really spoiling me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20015;I ran my mouth dry to keep [From.GetFirstName] entertained, but, while she does look interested in what I have to say, she barely puts in a word of her own. While all this talking has earned me her gratitude, it was not as instructive for me as I hoped it would be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20016;Amongst all the forgettable gossiping I have been doing in the past days, the only meaningful conversations that I remember having are the ones with [From.GetFirstName]. I have really grown to like her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20017;I had never realized what a great woman [From.GetFirstName] is, but spending all these afternoons talking with her has really changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20018;A month has passed since I gave birth to little [From.GetFirstName]. As is tradition, I should undergo my Churching, as any good [christian.GetGroupName] mother does, and rejoin the Holy Church now that my body has been cleansed of all impurities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20019;I submit myself to the forgiving embrace of Our Lord, ready to partake of His sacred flesh after the long abstinence imposed by my pregnancy. Yet, I must be certain to be free of sin before I undergo the holy communion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20020;As I took in the holy communion, a surge of ecstatic bliss filled my heart. In a fleeting moment, I saw a flight of angels from the stained glasses of the church spring to life, carrying my little [newborn_baby.GetFirstName] in their warm embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20021;As is tradition, my wife [From.GetFirstName] underwent her churching after recovering and cleansing herself from her recent pregnancy. When she returned home, she was teeming with excitement: while taking the holy communion she had a wondrous visions of angels leading our [newborn_baby.GetSonDaughter] [newborn_baby.GetFirstName] to glory. The child is surely destined for greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20022;My husband [From.GetFirstName] must have realized that something went wrong during my churching. [From.GetSheHeCap] spent the entire evening trying to cheer me up and clear all my lingering doubts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20023;Word of my unfortunate churching has reached my husband, yet, in a surprising show of kindness, [From.GetSheHe] has told me that, no matter what the truth is, [From.GetSheHe] is ready to forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20024;Word of my unfortunate churching has reached my husband, and [From.GetSheHe] is livid. [From.GetFirstName] is convinced that [newborn_baby.GetFirstName] is not [From.GetHerHis] child and denounced me publicly as a vile adulteress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20025;Something truly unexpected happened. During her recent churching, [From.GetFirstName] was unable to take her communion. The power of Christ compelled her to admit her infidelity towards her husband. Even worse, as she was choking on the sacred flesh, she called for my name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20028;The vision I had at my churching all those years ago was correct. [From.GetFirstName] is growing into an amazing [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20029;It has been a long while since [From.GetFirstName] gave me so much attention. I am fairly sure [From.GetHerHis] sudden interest in me might be related to my recent changes, but I cannot deny I am flattered by it nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20030;I have been feeling a lot more energetic than usual recently. Unfortunately, while I have had no problem wearing down the ears of everybody at court, I have been unable to focus all this newfound vitality on my duties. Yet, according to most scholars, an expecting mother should simply seclude herself in the dark for most of her pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20031;Spending all these hours laying awake in the dark was almost unbearable at first, but, after I ordering a bard to sing me stories from outside the bedroom, the experience has completely changed. Now I am a lot more relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20032;At first, [From.GetFirstName] struggled to rest properly in her dark room, but, after I had the brilliant idea of having a bard tell her stories from outside, the experience has become a lot more bearable for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20033;I can barely keep track of time, spending hours upon hours in the dark while the sun shines outside, then being unable to sleep when night finally comes. I was just bored at first, but now I am starting to be scared as well. After my prolonged seclusion, my mind is starting to conjure shadows and whispers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20034;The dark rest may be good for my future child's health, but it is proving to be detrimental to my wife's mental stability. She is finding it harder to sleep at night, and has become twitchy and impossible to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20035;I was dubious at first, but spending these long hours in quiet, dark meditation has helped me find peace. I am a lot less worried about my child than I was only a few weeks ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20036;Resting in the dark has really helped my wife calm herself and clear her head. She looks in much better health and ready to deliver a strong child, just as I hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20037;I might not be able to accomplish much while wasting all this time chatting, but at least I think I am becoming better at talking in general...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20038;My wife can really never stop chatting with courtiers and staff. If nothing else, this new habit of hers has made her much more comfortable and skilled at talking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20039;Being always so distracted might have prevented me from doing much work, but all this talking with my vassals and servants has had the unforeseen advantage of strengthening my relation with many of the people in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20040;Being always so distracted might have prevented my wife from taking a good rest, but all this talking with my vassals and servants has had the unforeseen advantage of strengthening her relation with many of the people in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20041;My husband [scoped_spouse.GetFirstName] has been so patient with me, carefully listening to all the rambling I have been doing in these last weeks... I have never felt so close to him before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20042;My wife has spent as much time with me as possible in the past week, constantly talking about the strangest subjects. I was worried at first, but now I am starting to enjoy our long conversations in a way I did not think possible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20043;With my wife [From.GetFirstName] pregnant, I am starting to worry if I shouldn't organize something special for this year's harvest rite. Pleasing [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] could be instrumental to ensure the birth of a healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20044;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetFirstName] decided to make a huge sacrifice during the seasonal festivity made to honor [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] this year, hoping it would help me deliver a strong child with little complications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20045;[From.GetFirstName] has really gone out of his way to ensure that both our child and I receive the favor of the gods. He has personally organized this year's harvest festival, and elected me to portray [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] herself during the celebration, hoping it will help me deliver a strong, healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20046;I place the baby back in the arms of the peasant woman and give her a warm smile as she thanks me for the blessing and gives space to the next petitioner. Acting on behalf of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] for this short time has truly made me understand how I could become a better [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20047;Wearing the symbols of divinity, looking at all the hopeful and awestruck faces of the petitioners come to take [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]'s blessing through me... It would be an overwhelming responsibility, if I didn't feel the touch of the goddess upon me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20048;This festival was no mere coincidence. I can feel the goddess' power coursing through my veins as I administer my blessings to the crowd of petitioners from [Root.Capital.GetName]. I must really be a descendant of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20049;Being carried around town, administering blessings on behalf of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess], is not as relaxing or satisfying as I hoped, but the people are loving this year's festival. They are always excited to see me smile at them and hold up their children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20050;Another noble guest bows his head at me, giving me his best wishes as my litter is moved through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. I never realized how many of my vassals are devout followers of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]. Having been elected to portray the goddess during the celebration has endeared me to many people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20051;This year, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was elected to represent [From.GetFertilityGoddess] during the harvest festival. The [From.GetTitle] has really risen up to the task, sharing her motherly love with all her subjects and ensuring prosperity to the land and cattle through her blessings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20052;Portraying [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] during the harvest festival is a very enjoyable experience. An entire crowd of petitioners has come to my [Root.GetHouse] to get my blessing. They all shower me with words of gratitude, many of them have even brought sweets and cider to serve as small offerings to the goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20053;As I administer another blessing, wearing [Root.GetFertilityGoddess]'s regalia, I wonder... If she is the goddess of life and fertility, how can she also be portrayed as virtuous? Is the drive that allows her to bring life to the world more important than her demeanor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20054;My wife was thrilled to take the role of [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] for the festival. She has been very popular with the public, maintaining a cheerful demeanor, always smiling at everybody. Hopefully this will both help her deliver a strong child as well as spread the goddess' blessing across my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20055;[From.GetFirstName] grows more beautiful every day. I had my doubts at first, but now I cannot deny it any longer: the child is surely blessed. When I played [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] while I was carrying her, the goddess must have touched her and gifted her with her beauty and purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20056;After much struggling, my wife bled out, giving birth to a fragile, sickly child. All the suffering that we went through has produced only a pale, skeletal creature that might not even survive the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20057;I have always lived a sheltered life because of my sickly disposition. Other children are scared of how I look, and many of the grown-ups are mad at me for killing my mother by being born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20058;Throughout my entire life, I have always been shadowed by death, yet I am still here. Despite my weak disposition and frail bones, I have endured past my childhood years. I cannot tell if this is a blessing or a curse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20059;I have survived my mother's death and the scorn of everybody around me. Many thought that I would die of illness long before now, but they were all wrong. Time and again I have escaped death, to the point that I now find myself no longer fearing its cold embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20060;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has always been a frail and quiet kid. Yet, the more [From.GetSheHe] grows, the more brazen [From.GetHerHis] behavior becomes. It seems like being constantly on the brink of death due to [From.GetHerHis] weak disposition has stripped away all of [From.GetHerHis] natural fears...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20061;As if being infidel to me was not enough, I have just discovered that, rather than risk her life in a difficult pregnancy, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to kill the child growing in her womb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20062;[From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow found out that my abortion was not an accident. Even worse, [From.GetSheHe] made the news public, accusing me of infanticide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20063;[From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow discovered that my abortion was not an accident. Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] understands why I took this decision and that [From.GetSheHe] is still willing to stand by me and support my choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20064;What horrible crime have I committed? Whenever I close my eyes I can hear the silent cries of my son that never was. The guilt for the ruthless murder of that innocent soul plagues my mind like a disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20065;The unthinkable has happened. Rumors about my terrible crime have spread across the court. And, if the stories are true, I have nobody to blame but myself. The servant whisper that every night I walk in my sleep around the castle, asking forgiveness to the child I murdered before his own birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20066;I feel that there is something wrong with me. The premature end to my last pregnancy broke something within me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20067;My lover [From.GetFirstName] has just informed me that she is pregnant with my child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20069;My [GetFromRelation] has been surprisingly understanding of my new habits. Knowing that I have [From.GetHerHis] unconditioned approval has put me much more at ease with my recent change in lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA20070;I was surprised to see how tactful my [GetFromRelation] has been ever since my last pregnancy. [From.GetSheHeCap] has allowed me to mourn in peace, without complaining about my isolation or attempting to drag me back into society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20000;Alright, [From.GetFirstName], what is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20001_A;Enough wine! I cannot risk ruining my next child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20001_B;Enough hashish! I cannot risk ruining my next child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20001_C;At least I stopped drinking since then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20001_D;At least I stopped smoking since then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20002_A;And she still drinks now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20002_B;And she still smokes now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20002_C;At least she stopped poisoning herself since then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20002_D;She was always unable to control her urges...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20003;It's well worth the nausea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20004;Better make a move quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20005;She needs familiar faces around her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20006;This is exactly what I needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20007;And I learn so much, just by listening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20008;At least I am learning some pretty interesting secrets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20009;Don't worry, I can handle this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20010;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20011;But that is the point, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_A;How does she do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_B;What a great gossiping partner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_C;I am flattered by her trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_D;Next child, [From.GetFirstName], next child...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_E;Oh, don't be so sour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_F;She was never that talkative to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_G;If that's what she wants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_H;I am sure it will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20015_I;She needs to eat for two after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20016;I am sure she wants to be my friend too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20017;She has become my dearest friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20018;I cannot wait to take the communion again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20019;I will make a donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20020_A;[newborn_baby.GetFirstName] is surely destined to greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20020_B;I feel so relieved now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20020_C;What sin have I committed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20020_D;No! That cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20021_A;How wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20021_B;I am happy for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20022;He can be so sweet sometimes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20023;I truly appreciate your support, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20024;You don't understand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20025;Impossible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20028;I am so proud of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20029;Enjoy it while it lasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20030_A;I should follow tradition and rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20030_B;She should rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20031;And I am learning a lot too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20032;And she is learning a lot too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20033;Who goes there!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20034;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20035;Blissful quiet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20036;All thanks to such a simple remedy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20037;And I love it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20038;If only we could have some quiet every once in a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20039;How fortuitous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20040;How fortuitous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20041;I think I am in love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20042;Am I falling in love with her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20043;I will dedicate the entire festival to [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20044;I am sure the goddess will protect me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20045;I am so excited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20046;I must talk more often with my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20047;I am truly special!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20048;I am a goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20049;Simple souls are easily impressed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20050;I wonder how long it will last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20051;She is such a pious woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20052;Refusing to eat would be blasphemous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20053;Virtue takes precedence, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20054_A;I am sure this will help her deliver the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20055;I could never be happier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20056;I will protect this child, for her sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20057;Nobody understands me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20058;I have nothing to fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20059;This is what I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20060;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20061;Not my child, not my problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20062;This is not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20063;I am so glad of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20064;What have I done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20065;I damned myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20066;Was I cursed by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20067;What wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20069;If only my throne was as supportive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20070;I only wish I could find the strength to thank [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP20000;Not now, child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20001;It is best not to think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20003;It would be inappropriate to flaunt my looks while I am with child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20004;She is with child. I should not look at her this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20005;I will have some maids dispatched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20006;Fine, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20007;I really do love talking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20008;I hate them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20009;What a blissful life I have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20010;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20011;We should make sure [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] is well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20016;She is only being polite because of the baby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20018;I have no time for these superstitions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20019;I will humble myself before God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20021;I am sure I can calm her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20030_A;But I love talking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20030_B;I will let her have her fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20042;It is but a passing fancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20043;I will make a larger sacrifice to [Root.GetFertilityGoddess] in her name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20045;I am truly flattered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20046;As a mother is to her children, I must be to my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20047;Could I be her own descendant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20052;My throat does get hoarse with all these blessings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20053;She inspired lust in all of us so we could create life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20056;The little monster stole her from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20057;I just wish to disappear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20058;I want to learn why I am like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20061;Everyone should know about her crime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20067;We can only hope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20005;She doesn't need old women filling her head with nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20007;I have never been so relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20008;Enough! Get out! I need some quiet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20009;Just soup? The baby is hungry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20011;Why can't we talk about something more interesting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20019;I will confess all my sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20021;She must deal with this problem on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20030;I should stop wasting all this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20043;No need to waste money on old superstitions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20045;I am humbled by this honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20046;I must be a more exemplar worshiper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20047;No mother was ever as honored as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20058;Now the world will suffer as I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20061;I must find the strength to forgive her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP20019;I need not do anything, for I am already pure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20021;Whatever happened, I forgive her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20061;I suppose we will have to try again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
