EVTDESC_RoI_2000;You have decided to organize a tiger hunt. You will invite your vassals to enjoy this occasion with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2001;Dear vassal,\n\nI am organizing a great tiger hunt for all my vassals, and hereby invite you to attend.\n\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RoI_2003;My liege,\n\nUnfortunately, I have pressing business that forces me to decline your invitation to the tiger hunt.\n\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2019;You have arrived at the hunting camp. Retainers are available to see to your every need, and soldiers will be useful both for guarding the camp and for flushing out any tigers. This should be a fine day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2020;The hunters and their respective entourages have gathered at the hunting camp. Retainers are available to see to your every need, and soldiers will be useful both for guarding the camp and for flushing out any tigers. This should be a fine day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2100;The social life at the camp is an important part of the tiger hunt. Late at night, after many cups of wine, you sit and talk into the small hours. You are having a good time, and it seems you have made a new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2102;The social life at the camp is an important part of the tiger hunt. Late at night, after many cups of wine, you sit and talk into the small hours. But misunderstandings occur so easily among the inebriated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2104;Evening pastimes during the tiger hunt include playing at cards. A group has gathered to play and you join them. Of course, the game is only interesting if you play for gold and silver - but how much will you bet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2105;The card game didn't go very well, and you lost a significant amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2106;You had mixed fortunes at the card game, and in the end your wins and losses balanced out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2107;You had an excellent run at the card game, and won a significant amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2111;The hunting party moves through the jungle. You are hoping luck will find you a tiger to kill. Suddenly, there is a movement in the underbrush... and a large tiger springs out, roaring fiercely! It attacks the hunting party, but soldiers immediately move to attack it and they manage to kill it with their spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Suddenly, there is a movement in the underbrush... and a large tiger springs out, roaring fiercely! It attacks the hunting party, striking at one of the hunters, ripping and tearing flesh before disappearing again into the jungle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2120;Several forward scouts come running back to the main hunting party. In excited whispers, they inform you that a large tiger has been spotted ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2121;Stepping forward, you watch the tiger closely, weighing your spear in your hand and waiting for the right moment to strike. The tiger prowls towards you, slowly. Then suddenly, it leaps towards you! You sidestep and stab with your spear, sinking it deeply into its flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2122;Stepping forward, you watch the tiger closely, weighing your spear in your hand and waiting for the right moment to strike. The tiger prowls towards you, slowly.

EVTDESC_RoI_2123;Stepping forward, you watch the tiger closely, weighing your spear in your hand and waiting for the right moment to strike. Then suddenly, the tiger leaps towards you! Surprised, you stumble backwards as it starts to tear at you with claws and teeth. Your soldiers run in, stabbing at the beast, and it decides to retreat, disappearing into the dense vegetation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2124;The hunting party edges forward, encircling the area and closing on the tiger. The beast discovers the trap too late and tries to run, but the hunters close in from all sides, stabbing with their spears. The tiger roars wildly as its life's blood spills over the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2125;The hunting party edges forward, encircling the area and closing on the tiger. The beast, however, smells the trap and turns and flees into the dense vegetation. Several soldiers run after it but return shortly after to report that the animal is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2501;A most successful hunt! A slain tiger means luck for the realm and everyone heads for home with new optimism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_2502;A failed hunt! No tigers were slain, and this is an ill omen for the realm. You vow to return and have better luck next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
