EVTDESC_CM_1000;As your father Pepin died, he divided the Empire of the Franks and left one half to you and the other half to your brother. He divided the lands in such a way as to force you to cooperate - but it does not appear to have had the desired effect. The friction is constant, and at every turn it seems your brother is now trying to thwart your plans and weaken your position. You still rule as joint kings, but surely this peace cannot last...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1002;With the death of your brother [From.GetFirstName], the prestige and honor of the Frankish kingship falls on you. He was your rival but now he is no more. There is still much to be done, but here begins a new chapter in the story of [Root.GetFirstName], [Root.GetTitle] of the Franks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1010;My Lord, the power of your enemies are growing steadily, and while your vassals are surely loyal beyond doubt, it would perhaps be prudent to look for alliances outside the Frankish realm. If you would marry a daughter of the Lombard King, you could gain a powerful ally if things threaten to get out of hand due your brother's devious machinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1011;My Lord, there is a lot of grumbling among the lords of the realm. While it is understood that your marriage to [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has great political utility, it is hard for many to accept that you have married a princess from the realm of our age-old enemies the Lombards. It has reached the point where you may even be losing the support of some nobles. But perhaps it is still not too late to rectify the situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1021;Your mother has come to see you. As she is shown in, she falls to her knees in front of you and says: 'My dearest son. I know my support for your brother in your struggle may have caused you grief. After his death, I have seen how wrong I was to take sides. Please, can you find it in your heart to forgive me and take me into your household, so that I may now repay the injury that I have done to you with new love and loyalty?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1024;My son,\nI write to you to ask that you stop causing trouble for your brother and do not interefere with his plans. He loves you and you should support him instead of making things difficult for him. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] sees all and family should not fight with family.\n\nYour loving mother,\n[Root.Mother.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1027;Your mother has come to see you. She speaks to you of your brother and the rivalry between you: 'My dear Charles, it grieves me so that your brother Carloman will not support you as he should but rather has wicked designs on your domains. Rest assured, however, that I shall do all in my power to help and support you. I have even written to him, asking him to cease his plotting and acknowledge that, though the realm is divided between you, he recognize you as the primary ruler of the Franks. I fear, however, that he will not listen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1040;Your son Pepin is illegitimate, but perhaps he could grow into a man worthy of ruling the Franks? His body is twisted and he looks frail, but a boy that overcomes such unfair punishments in life could perhaps with time become an even stronger ruler?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1050;A young nobleman called Roland has approached you, declaring that he wishes to serve you. You have heard his name before, he is known to be a strong warrior and able diplomat, wise beyond his years and especially familiar with the Breton lands to the west. He would surely be a useful addition to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1052;You have been spending a lot of time talking to [roland.GetFullName] recently. He is not only loyal but also wise, amiable and very good company. You find you have many things in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1053;Your loyal knight Roland is truly distinguishing himself on campaign. He never fears to lead from the front in battle, he fires up his soldiers with his personal bravery, and he is always first into the fray and the last to withdraw. Where outriders are needed for dangerous scouting missions he insists on going, often being away for days behind enemy lines. If only all your soldiers were this brave and dedicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1055;The battle won, Roland led a small group of knights in aggressive pursuit, leaving the rest of the army far behind. Penetrating deep through the enemy formations and causing havoc, they caused much damage. Then no one knows what happened - maybe they went too far, or maybe they were surprised by an unexpected counterattack. None of them returned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1057;As your army was retreating, the battle lost, Roland took a small group of knights and rode out to raid the enemy's flank and harass them in order to slow them down so that the rest of your forces could escape. It is said that they fought fiercely and valiantly. However, none of them returned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1070;My Lord, there is a visitor at the gate, a Norseman calling himself Ogier. He looks strong and rugged but also speaks with grace and has a noble bearing. He says he comes from the land of the Danes and has travelled far to offer his services to you, naming you rightful lord of all Christians. He also claims to have seen in a dream how you will conquer all and your name will rise in glory to the Heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1076;[From.GetDynName], the wife of the recently deceased [FromFrom.GetTitledName], has arrived at your gates, asking for refuge for herself and her offspring. She claims that her late husband's evil brother murdered him in cold blood in order to take control of the realm for himself, and now she fears for her life as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1077;Word reaches you that [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]'s wife [FromFrom.GetDynName] has received refuge at the court of [From.GetTitledName]. Surely, there is a plot against you brewing here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1078;Your soldiers have brought [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]'s family before you. [FromFrom.GetDynName] falls to her knees, begging you for mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1080;[From.GetDynName] has appeared at your gate, begging for protecton. They are destitute and alone, woman and child. She speaks weakly and nervously: 'My Lord, I have nothing left and I throw myself at your feet and put faith in your mercy. Remember that it is not I but your brother that was your enemy'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1100;The heathen Saxons living North of the realms of the Franks have for a long time held their own against all foreign conquerors, while defiantly staying true to their old religion and raiding Christian lands with no fear of God. No longer shall it be so - the time has come to bring them both the Sword and the Cross. Mercy is something they will find in the next life, should they accept baptism before they perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1101;You have captured the great pagan sanctuary at Paderborn, one of the holiest places of Germanic paganism. Here stands the great holy tree of Irminsul, which is said to have an immense importance in the heathen faith of the Saxons. To them, Irminsul represents the 'world tree' and is a focus from which they appear to draw much moral strength and inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1102;As the bitter war in Saxony rages on, the armies of [From.GetTitledName] have captured Paderborn, the site of the great shrine of the holy tree of Irminsul. By order of the conquering [From.GetTitle], the troops burned the holy tree and then proceeded to destroy the entire shrine. This has infuriated people of the Germanic religion everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1104;During the course of the Saxon War, you have captured a lot of Saxon prisoners. Many of them are of noble birth and also very defiant in their views and attitude to our righteous Christian conquest. They keep to their heathen ways and scorn the name of Christ. Perhaps it is time to teach these stubborn Saxons a lesson through a show of strength. If we should try, condemn and execute these captured heathen leaders, we may strengthen our cause, please God and put fear into the hearts of our enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1105;The Saxons are a people that clings fiercely to its old traditions. After suffering defeats and conquest in spite of tenacious resistance, discontent has continued to simmer in the Pagan Saxon lands. Raids on tax collectors, defiance of church duties, all these things have been annoyances to the new rulers without really presenting any severe danger. Now, however, things seem to have changed. A rebel leader has emerged, uniting the rebellious Saxons and gathering warriors for more concerted attacks. He calls himself Widukind, a name that means 'Child of the Woods', in obvious reference to old Pagan myths and fitting to the hit-and-run tactics used by his forces thus far. The army he is gathering is growing, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1108;My Lord, your old enemy Widukind of the Saxons has sent word. He says he recognizes not only the strength of your arms but also the superiority of the Christian faith. He asks for free passage to come to your court in order to be baptized as a Christian. He says he wishes only peace between you and in return for your generosity he will be forever your loyal servant and stay true to the creed of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1120;Your mother comes to see you. 'My son, your brother's plotting against you is dangerous. I know you love him as dearly as I do, but something must be done. With your permission, I shall go see him and do what is needed to resolve this conflict. He must not come in the way of you fulfilling your destiny as ruler of all the Franks, but I fear a bloody war. Trust me, it will be better like this.'\n\nYou look thoughtfully at your mother, trying to read her mind. There is an odd look of determination in her eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1121;Your mother Bertrada has arrived at the gate. She travels with a but a small escort and she is asking to see you. Shall we let her in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1122;As you dine with your mother that night, she speaks with you of your youth and of her great love for you: 'I know it pains you that I support your brother, but please let us speak of happier days. I would like to forget for a moment these troublesome times and spend the evening with you in intimacy and friendship. We can dine and reminisce, and you shall be my beloved son as always. Here, i brought some excellent wine for you to drink while we talk of old times.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1123;Your mother left early this morning, before you woke. It was strange to see her again like that. You have a strange, slow pain in your stomach as well, and you feel rather weak. Maybe it's something you ate or drank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1132;To my former liege, [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick],\n\nIt is with great regret that I must inform you that I am declaring fealty to the true ruler of the Franks. I do not find your claim at all satisfactory and have decided to serve the stronger King.\n\nFor the glory of the Frankish Empire,\n[switching_vassal.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1160;One evening at court, your mother [Root.Mother.GetFirstName] takes to voicing very aggressive criticism of your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] in front of everyone. She says your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] doesn't know [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] place and should be kept on a tighter leash. Your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] looks pleadingly at you for support...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1172;Your mother comes to see you. 'My [Root.GetSonDaughter], I am worried. Your [target_councillor.GetJobTitle], [target_councillor.GetTitledFirstName], doesn't seem to have our best interests in mind when executing the tasks of [target_councillor.GetHerHis] office. I fear [target_councillor.GetSheHe] may become a danger to your rule in the long run.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1181;[target_mother.GetDynName] has decided that she will take over the regency for her [From.GetSonDaughter],  [From.GetTitledFirstName]. It seems there is nothing you can do about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1182;Your mother [Root.Mother.GetFirstName] has decided that it is best that she rule as your regent instead of [Root.Regent.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1192;Persistent and disturbingly detailed rumors have it that your mother [Root.Mother.GetFirstName] has managed to seduced your [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [target_spouse.GetFirstName], engaging in carnal relations behind your back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1401;You are getting tired of serving [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], but [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is very powerful. Perhaps it is time to seek foreign allies - the Franks to the north are growing ever more powerful and surely have no love for the [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName]s. You could promise them your fealty in exchange for assistance - you needn't keep your promise once they have helped you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1402;You have received a most unusual embassy from Spain. An emissary from [From.GetTitledNameWithNick] comes before you and speaks: 'My [From.GetLordLady] has come to request your assistance against the evil [From.Liege.GetTitledName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks for a pledge of your armed assistance in rebellion, and in return [From.GetSheHe] will swear fealty to you once the yoke of [From.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] oppression is off [From.GetHerHis] back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1403;Your emissaries have returned from Francia with bad news. [From.GetTitledName] has declined your request for assistance against your [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1404;Your emissaries have returned from Francia with good news. [From.GetTitledName] has accepted your offer and pledged to help you in your rebellion against your [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1405;The time is now! [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] armies will sally forth to depose the [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName]s, and the might of the Franks will stand behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1406;My [Root.GetLordLady], the news from Spain is that [From.GetTitledName] has risen in rebellion against the [target_liege.GetOnlyDynastyName]s. The time has come to honor our agreement and intervene with our armies to aid them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1408;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have finally gained our independence from the [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName]s. The Frankish ruler who aided us will expect that you honor your pledge and swear fealty. What is your command?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1409;My [Root.GetLordLady], the treacherous [From.GetTitledName] has gone back on [From.GetHerHis] word and refused to swear fealty to you, in spite of you so generously helping [From.GetHerHim] gain [From.GetHerHis] independence from the Umayyads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1410;My [Root.GetLordLady], the treacherous [From.GetTitledName] has gone back on [From.GetHerHis] word and refused to aid you against the Umayyads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_1500;Having taken the reins of power without fear, defeated his enemies and ruled the Frankish realms successfully, [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] was finally crowned emperor on [GetDateText]. He stood still as a statue and cold as ice before the throne as the crown of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was solemnly placed upon his head. True heir to his father Pepin, descendant of Karl the Hammer, leader of men and master of war, he was claiming his exalted place in history. He looked out across the gathered lords and priests, his eye fixed on something beyond this triumphant moment, something great, a new ambition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_CM_1000;He will not succeed in his vile schemes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1002;Still, he was my brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1010;Yes, this will be a good marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1011;I knew this was a bad idea. I'll renounce her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1021;I forgive you, Mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1024;It is clear that she is not on my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1027;I thank you for your support, Mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1040;I will legitimize him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1050;Welcome, Roland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1052;A good and stalwart friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1053;A model knight indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1055;Alas! He was my bravest knight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1070;Welcome this bringer of good prophecies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1076;You shall be welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1077;This will not go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1078;Lock them up in houses of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1080;To the convent with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1100;Crush the heathens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1101;Burn it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1102;Irminsul! We will have our revenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1104;Behead them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1105;These indomitable Saxons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1108;I will welcome him and baptize him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1120;Yes, Mother. Go and sort this out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1121;Yes, let her in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1122;Ah, wine... good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1123;Something is wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1132;This is unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1160;Mother is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1172;You are right, Mother. The [target_councillor.GetJobTitle] has to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1182;I am sure she knows best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1192;I am sure it is nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1401;I will send a messenger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1402;Very well, we shall sign an agreement to that effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1403;This crushes my hopes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1404;Time to prepare for war, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1405;Make them suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1406;Raise the banners and ride forth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_1408;My word is sacred and I shall honor it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_CM_1010;No Lombards in my bed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1011;She is their Queen now. They must learn to accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1021;Begone, witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1040;I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1050;I don't need a new knight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1070;We don't need his kind here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1076;I am sorry, this does not concern me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1078;They must die, there is no other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1080;Snake-spawn must be killed ere they bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1100;Leave them alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1101;Keep it and build a grand Christian church on the site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1102;A foul sacrilege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1104;I shall be merciful even to these heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1108;Let's invite him here and then kill him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1120;There is no point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1121;I have nothing to say to that woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1122;I don't trust you, mother. Please leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1160;Quiet, Mother. You are out of line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1172;I will not get rid of [target_councillor.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1181;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1182;Hmm... who really rules this [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetTier]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1192;Alas, I must send [target_spouse.GetFirstName] away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1401;No, it's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1402;I'm sorry, Spanish politics do not interest me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1406;I have reconsidered. We'll leave them to their fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1408;[Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] take the Franks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_1409;Such treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_CM_1101;Leave this devil-tree well alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_1102;Gloria in excelsis Deo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_1108;I shall not even dignify such a proposal with an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_1160;I've had enough. It's the convent for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_1172;Enough of your meddling. It's the convent for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_1192;That's it. Mother must be sent to a convent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_CM_1192;They must both be punished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
