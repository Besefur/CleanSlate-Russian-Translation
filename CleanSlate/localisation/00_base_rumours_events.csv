EVTDESC69000;The lifestyle of a childless courtier has made me suspect that he fancies other men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me today if I really fancied men over women!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69002;A note left on my table by an unseen visitor told me that if I did not deliver fifty gold within one hour to [From.GetTitledFirstName], my secret would be a secret no more. A small post scriptum wrote: 'the secret is that you are a sodomite'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69003;A childless courtier with a strange choice of lifestyle has shown men a bit more attention than the women at court. Might it be that he is a sodomite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] started questioning my lifestyle, asked why I didn't have any children and made me feel incredibly awkward. My answers did not seem to satisfy [From.GetHerHim] and finally [From.GetSheHe] blurted out [From.GetHerHis] question: was I or was I not a sodomite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69005;I need to prove to everyone who thinks I prefer men over women that I am not a sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69006;An unfriendly [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] denounced me in front of everyone today because of the silly rumors about me being a sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69007;I have started to doubt myself, might it be that the rumors are true? Am I a sodomite, attracted to men rather than women?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69010;The affection a courtier shows his sister is unnatural. I have begun to suspect they might be having a incestuous affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69011;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] started implying that I and my sister had an incestuous affair I could do nothing but deny, deny and deny. No matter what 'evidence' [From.GetFirstName] think [From.GetSheHe] has, [From.GetSheHe] cannot prove anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me what [From.GetHerHis] silence was worth to me, and when I asked [From.GetHerHim] what in the world [From.GetSheHe] was talking about, [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] knows about my incestuous affair with my sister. If I did not pay [From.GetHerHim], there would be nothing stopping [From.GetHerHim] from telling everybody about our forbidden love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69013;I did not know [From.GetTitledFirstName] could be so charming, and I had never really noticed how handsome [From.GetSheHe] is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69015;The rumors about my supposed incestuous love affair with my sister has reached the ears of my confessor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69016;My sister and I enjoyed a few hours together in the high, abandoned tower of [Root.Location.GetName] when a child's face appeared in one of the windows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69017;I should have killed the child when I had the chance! The child told everyone about me and my sister in the tower, describing in detail what it had seen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69020;Everyone knows how deep and passionate the love between one of the courtiers and his wife are, but sadly it has not resulted in any children. I have heard the wife asking the other wives about cures and ways to get with child but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69021;The biggest grief in our lives is the absence of children so when [From.GetTitledFirstName] stuck [From.GetHerHis] long nose in our private life the longing and sorrow returned with full force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69022;I would never have thought anyone would try to profit off our grief, our sorrow that we have failed to conceive a child. The demand for gold or the secret about our trouble conceiving would be out in the open made me furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69024;It seems as if the rumor about me being impotent has spread throughout the court. People are laughing behind my back, or so my so-called 'friends' tell me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69030;The lingering looks, the small, almost inappropriate touches, the secret smiles given to someone other than his wife... A courtier is having an affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69031;We hadn't been as discreet as we had hoped, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about the adultery I had committed with the beautiful lady at the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69032;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] denied that [From.GetSheHe] had committed adultery I was stunned, I had been so sure of what I had seen that it had never occurred to me that I might be wrong. I apologised and [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted the apology with a frown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69033;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me about my husband [From.GetFirstName]'s little affair with some unknown women I was furious! My rage had subsided a bit when I finally found my cheating husband, but as I saw him admiring the bosom of yet another clueless little strumpet the rage grew once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69034;The fury in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s eyes scared me nearly to death and when [From.GetSheHe] started screaming and cursing at me I wished I was dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69035;[From.GetTitledFirstName] forgave me for my little indiscretion but I could see how much it had hurt her. I promised and swore that I would never commit adultery again, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69036;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was direct: if I did not pay [From.GetHerHim] to keep quiet, [From.GetTitledFirstName] would make sure everyone in the court would know about my little affair with one of the court ladies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69038;I came home one evening and found that my wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] had told our children about my affair and now they all refuse to speak to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69039;The voices could be heard through the walls and I recognized them as belonging to my wife and my mistress. My wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] tried to make my mistress break up with me, but she refused so I decided to step in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69040;I knocked on the door and heard him swear when something was knocked to the floor and broke, by the sound of it. When he finally called 'Come in!' I opened the door and saw the messy room, filled with weird looking glasses, stuffed exotic animals and the man I was visiting in the middle of the mess with singed eyebrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69041;My latest experiment went a bit badly and I was trying to clean up the mess when someone knocked on the door. [From.GetTitledFirstName] entered and saw the mess I was standing in, with my singed eyebrows and the remains of my experiment spread all over the room. It didn't take long before [From.GetSheHe] accused me of dealing with the occult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69042;I could hardly believe my ears when [From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pressure me into giving [From.GetHerHim] money to keep quiet about my dealings with the occult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69044;A child has gone missing and it seems as if everyone suspects me to have something to do with that. Apparently being a suspected occultist everyone believes I might use the entrails of children to read the future. Pah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69045;The voice woke me up, whispering about spells to awaken the dead, curses to make your enemy go blind and potions to make anyone fall in love with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69046;My confessor talked sternly to me, clearly avoiding to bring up the occultist rumor but as I just nodded and accepted all he told me without admitting to anything, he lost his patience with me. He scolded me and told me to repent, to stop fiddling with the occult or else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69047;I had only managed to remember one of the many spells and invocations the voice had whispered to me in the dark. It was long and complicated with many different ingredients, not all easy to acquire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69050;The diplomatic skill of [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] is deplorable! No matter what task I give [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHim] [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] always manage to disappoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69051;[From.GetTitledFirstName] claims my diplomatic skill is deplorable! No matter how hard I work, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is never satisfied and [From.GetHerHis] demands are preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69052;I have to trust Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] to train my troops and to be able to suppress revolts but [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has not proved to be adept in those manners. [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] have to shape up or I need to find another Marshal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69053;I know I have failed [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s expectations for what a Marshal should be able to do, but if only [From.GetSheHe] could give me a chance I would show [From.GetHerHim] that I do not lack in martial skill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69054;I sent Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] to oversee construction in a county - and the building fell apart almost instantly. Then I sent him to collect taxes in one of the richest provinces and [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] returned with much less than I had anticipated. [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] clearly lacks the stewardship skill needed to perform even the simplest of tasks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69055;It was not my fault the builders had used inferior materials for the building, nor that the locals managed to swindle us on most of the taxes. Still, my liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] aren't too happy with me as a Steward and I do not blame him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69056;An efficient Spymaster must be able to uncover plots. Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] did not even manage to uncover a plot which was being planned right under [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHis] nose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69057;I was so ashamed when the plot unfurled in front of my nose when I hadn't even noticed that something was going on. It was right of [From.GetTitledFirstName] to chastise me, but still, it hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69058;It seems to me [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as pious as [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] claims to be. Instead of improving relations with the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] managed to make an utter fool out of [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerselfHimself] and, indirectly, me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69059;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] was a bit too harsh when [Root.GetSheHe] chastised me for ruining the relations with the local clergy! Although, I admit, I should probably have chosen less unconventional ways of assuring their support...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69060;The lack of piety I have observed in one of the courtiers makes me worried. I wouldn't want to accuse anyone of not being a good Christian, but if my suspicions are correct then something needs to be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69061;Religion has never been one of my great strengths, I do believe in a God but I have trouble accepting all the rituals and demands the priests of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith feel necessary. [From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about this, I hadn't even realized my lack of piety was so noticeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69062;All those rituals and demands the priests of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church feel necessary to prove one's piety is pure nonsense. Despite my feelings about those unnecessary, empty gestures I have always been careful to not show my lack of piety, but perhaps not careful enough. If I don't pay [From.GetTitledFirstName] fifty gold [From.GetSheHe] will expose my lack of faith to everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69064;Why will you burn in hell?', my child asked me. The rumors of my lack of piety had obviously spread throughout the castle and now even my children have heard about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69065;Now even the Pope has heard about my lack of piety! Officially, the Pope sent the legate to make sure the bonds between the Pope and the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church in [Root.Location.GetName] is still strong despite my lack of piety but unofficially, the legate was there to give me a stern speech about my lack of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69066;Now even the Caliph has heard about my lack of piety! The Caliph's messenger was there to give me a stern speech about my lack of faith and to make sure the bonds between the Caliph and the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church in [Root.Location.GetName] is still strong despite my lack of piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69070;The man is a coward, that's for certain! He can't fight, shadows and loud noises frighten him and blood makes him faint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69071;I gave a small shriek when [From.GetTitledFirstName] touched my arm, which didn't really help when I tried to defend myself from [From.GetHerHis] accusations about my cowardice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69072;'Fifty gold', [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me.\n'Fifty gold or I tell everyone what a coward you are...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69074;The soldiers watched me while I practised with my sword and one of them asked when I had finished why I was taking unnecessary risks when practising with the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69075;Women laugh behind your back', someone told me.\n'Women laugh behind your back because of your reputation of being a coward'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69076;I have finally proven my bravery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69080;Everyone at court believes I am a sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69081;Everyone at court believes that my sister and I has an incestuous affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69082;My wife and I have been unable to conceive a child, and now everyone believes I am impotent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69083;Rumours at the court suggests that I have been unfaithful and committed adultery with one of the ladies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69084;My harmless experiments and interest in science has led to rumors erupting in court about me being an occultist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69085;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s distrust in me as [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetChancellorName] has made everyone in court dislike me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69086;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s distrust in me as [From.GetHerHis] Marshal has made everyone in court dislike me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69087;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s distrust in me as [From.GetHerHis] Steward has made everyone in court dislike me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69088;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s distrust in me as [From.GetHerHis] Spymaster has made everyone in court dislike me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69089;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s distrust in me as [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetLordSpiritualName] has made everyone in court dislike me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69090;Somehow the rumors at court is all about me lacking piety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69091;Everybody 'knows' I am a big, fat coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69095;It seems to me [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as pious as [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] claims to be. Instead of improving relations with the imams, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] managed to make an utter fool out of [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerselfHimself] and, indirectly, me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69096;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] was a bit too harsh when [Root.GetSheHe] chastised me for ruining the relations with the imams! Although, I admit, I should probably have chosen less unconventional ways of assuring their support...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69100;The lack of piety I have observed in one of the courtiers makes me worried. I wouldn't want to accuse anyone of not being a good Muslim, but if my suspicions are correct then something needs to be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69101;Faith has never been one of my great strengths, I do believe in Allah but I have trouble accepting all the rituals and demands the imams feel necessary. [From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about this, I hadn't even realized my lack of piety was so noticeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69102;All those rituals and demands the imams feel necessary to prove one's piety is pure nonsense. Despite my feelings about those unnecessary, empty gestures I have always been careful to not show my lack of piety, but perhaps not careful enough. If I don't pay [From.GetTitledFirstName] fifty gold [From.GetSheHe] will expose my lack of faith to everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA69000;Ask him if he really desires men rather than women;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69001;What nerve! I love women, not men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69002;I cannot let anyone believe that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69003;I will accuse him of sodomy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69004;What!? No! No, I am not a sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69005;The brothels it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69006;[Root.Religion.GetPriestTitleCap] or not, nobody denounces me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69007;I don't know what to know anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69010;I should warn him about his incestuous affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69011;I love my sister, but not in that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69012;Your silence is very valuable to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69013;Well, I wouldn't kick [From.GetHerHim] out of my bed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69015;I have sinned, if not in flesh then in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69016;The things I do for love...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69017;I fear the Holy Father will not look kindly upon us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69020;Might he be impotent? I have to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69021;We have a little trouble conceiving, that is all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69022;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] would be devastated, I have to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69024;Let them laugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69030;It is my duty to confront him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69031;I did not commit adultery with that woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69032;I know what I saw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69033;You BASTARD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69034;I will never cheat on you again, I promise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69035;Trust me on this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69036;Take this, I don't want to see you ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69038;Why did you have to involve them?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69039;I reassure my mistress of my deep love for her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69040;Have you tampered with the occult?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69041;Are you mad? I would never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69042;This is all I have got...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69044;I ignore the talks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69045;I hope I can remember all of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69046;I repent, I will never fiddle with the occult again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69047;This spell will benefit me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69050;You are not good enough, you have to shape up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69051;[From.GetTitledFirstName] does not appreciate me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69052;Shape up or you're out of a job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69053;I will make you appreciate me, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69054;Not good enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69055;I will shape up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69056;You can and must do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69057;I'm sorry, I'll work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69058;Why does [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] disappoint every time I try to trust [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69059;Why can't I be appreciated for the things I do right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69060;Confront the courtier about the lack of piety;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69061;I will prove my piety by good deeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69062;Here, now leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69064;I won't burn in hell! Where have you heard that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69065;I will donate to the church just to keep him quiet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69066;I will prove my piety by doubling, nay, tripling the zakat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69070;You are a disgrace and I despise you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69071;I will try to prove myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69072;Please don't tell anyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69074;I need to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69075;I admit, I am a coward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69076;This is a glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69080;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69081;That is preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69082;We only need to try more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69083;...and now my wife believes those rumors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69084;So what if I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69085;What have I done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69086;Totally unjustified, I am sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69087;Well then [From.GetSheHe] should get a new Steward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69088;Why I never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69089;This is troubling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69090;How could that happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69091;I strongly reject the notion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB69000;I should tell others about my suspicion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69001;You are right. I desire men, not women;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69002;No one will believe that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69003;It is my duty to inform everyone about this suspected sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69004;Yes, I am a sodomite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69005;I should talk about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69006;Just keep quiet, people will forget this soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69010;I have to tell everyone about their incestuous affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69011;I will prove I am not having an affair with my sister!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69012;You cannot prove anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69013;Charming and handsome won't buy your way to my bed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69015;I have nothing to confess, nothing to be forgiven for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69016;Ignore the child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69020;It surprises me no one else knows this, I should tell them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69021;It's true, I'm impotent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69022;I will never give in to your demands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69030;I should tell someone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69031;I won't say a word;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69032;Maybe I was wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69033;I should forgive and forget. I still love him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69036;As if someone would believe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69039;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], you are the one I love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69040;I got to get out of here and tell everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69041;I cackled madly at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69042;I don't care if everyone knows about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69044;I attempt to clear my name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69045;I ignore the voice and go back to sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69046;Or what? You haven't got anything but rumors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69047;I must recant my acts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69050;I don't trust [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] to do a good job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69052;I don't think [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] is the right [Root.job_marshal.GetManWoman] for this job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69054;I can't say I trust [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69056;[Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] failed me, now I have to do the job myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69058;I cannot trust you with anything, can I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69060;Expose the courtier as not Christian enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69061;I shrug the question off. I feel no need to explain myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69062;Find someone else to extort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69064;I truly need to repent or I will burn in Hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69065;Ignore him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69070;I will tell the whole castle about his cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69071;I'm not craven! Just easily startled...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69072;Go ahead! I'm n-not afraid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69074;I am a coward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69075;I am NOT a coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69100;Expose the courtier as not a good Muslim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC69000;I will accept money in exchange for my silence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69010;I wonder how much my silence is worth to him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69020;This is perhaps a secret he would pay to keep secret...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69030;I need a bit of persuasion if he wants me to stay silent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69040;He might pay for my silence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69047;The Church is after me, save me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69050;[Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] lack of diplomatic skill has cost me dearly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69052;I might be persuaded to let you keep your job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69054;Do you want to keep your job? Then pay up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69056;You don't deserve the salary I pay you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69058;You will pay for this fiasco with your own means!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69060;I could keep quiet, for a price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69065;I will repent publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69070;I could squeeze him for some money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
