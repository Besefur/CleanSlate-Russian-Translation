EVTDESC_ZE_9000;As the war rages on, you find that your so-called ally, [ally_not_active_in_war.GetTitledNameWithNick], has been inactive for several years, not taking any offensive action to support you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9001;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIt pains me greatly to have to tell you that I have noticed the absence of your armies on the field of battle while the war is being fought by others. As I have no need for cowardly and treacherous allies, you may henceforth consider our alliance void.\n\nWith the hope of your speedy demise,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9100;Pirates have been marauding in increasing numbers all along the coast of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] recently. Worse, there is a rumor among the common folk that the pirates are being aided by [pirate_alliance_friction_ally.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9101;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nWe are experiencing a plague of pirates on our coasts, and there is a rumor that you are supporting them. Can you please put my mind at ease regarding this, for I assume that it is not true. Or is it...?\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9110;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt grieves me to hear of your troubles. However, I can assure you that I have nothing to do with the pirates that plague your coasts.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9111;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou are a [GetFromRootInsult] and a liar and I will have you know that our pact has been broken through no fault of mine but through your treacherous actions.\n\nMay your days be filled with deserved misery,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9120;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI must say I do not approve of the tone in your last letter. Accusing others to try and obscure your own failings in keeping your realm safe only leaves you looking like a [GetFromRootInsult].\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery from your paranoia,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9121;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt distresses me that you perceived my earlier letter as accusing you and questioning your honor, as that was not my intention. Please accept my sincerest apologies for this misunderstanding, and rest assured that I do not suspect you of involvement in piracy.\n\nWith hopes of continued friendship,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9122;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI accept your apology and look forward to many more years of continued good relations.\n\nWith my kindest regards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9123;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nLamentably, your words of apology do not ring true. I am no fool, and a trust that has been broken cannot be repaired with mere empty words. I cannot maintain a pact under such circumstances.\n\nWith scant pleasure,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9130;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYour aggressive words only serve to strengthen my suspicions regarding your low character and propensity to underhanded dealings. Clearly you planning some dark deed. I demand that you cease at once.\n\nWith reluctant regards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9131;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou are quite right that I have erred in my ways. However, after pondering my faults and considering what a [GetFromRootCompliment] you are, I am now fully committed to seeing you prosper and to preserve our good relationship. I convey to you my sincere and humble apologies.\n\nWith the greatest respect and admiration,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_9132;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYou are the worst kind of scum to frame and then attack in such a vile way those who have been so loyal and steadfast towards you. You are a [GetFromRootInsult] and I would not wish upon anyone the misfortune of making pacts or agreements with you.\n\nSincerely and disappointedly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_9000;[ally_not_active_in_war.GetSheHeCap] has failed me for the last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_9001;I never...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_9100;I must send a letter to the [pirate_alliance_friction_ally.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] [pirate_alliance_friction_ally.GetTitle] and find out if it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_9122;It is all good, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_9123;Very well, if it must be so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_9130;I should back down before this breaks our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_9131;Ah, very well then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_9000;I'll just pretend I didn't notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_9101;A strange accusation. [From.GetSheHeCap] is up to something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_9110;[From.GetSheHeCap] lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_9120;The [GetRootFromInsult] is hiding something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_9121;I must distance myself from this [GetRootFromInsult] snake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
