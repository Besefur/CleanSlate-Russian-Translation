EVTDESCLoR.400;One day in the Imperial Palace, while surrounded by shouting advisors waving decrees and edicts that demand your signature, a small man approaches claiming to be a representative of the Venetoi - the "Blues," one of the two major chariot teams racing in Constantinople. They no longer have the political influence they enjoyed in the days of Justinian the Great, but they are still popular with the broad masses. You wave your advisors away and decide to hear him out.\n\nThe man introduces himself as Anaximandros and explains that he has a proposal for you. If you race for the Blues in the grand chariot race next week, he and his associates will make certain you win. You both stand to gain from this, with the glorious [Root.GetTitle] winning as a champion of the great Blue team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.401;You practise hard at chariot racing to better prepare for the upcoming event at the Hippodrome. Despite managing well enough and only falling off the chariot a handful of times, you simply cannot see how you are supposed to beat the other professional racers. When you mention this to Anaximandros, the little gnome of a man smiles and tells you not to worry. He assures you that the Greens, your main opponents, will not be a problem, and the other Blue racers have been instructed to let you win.\n\n"You had better be right about this," you tell Anaximandros. "If I am made to look the fool, I swear I will not be the only one to suffer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.402;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt. Spyridon, the star of the Greens, looks at you with scorn as your chariots line up. "I shall endeavour not to embarrass you too much, Your Imperial Majesty," he says through clenched teeth.\n\nThe trumpets blow, and the race begins! One by one, the Green chariots fall apart and topple over, giving you a clear path. Only Spyridon's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. Still, you skillfully navigate through the wreckage and manage to hold off Spyridon long enough to win the race!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.403;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt.

One by one, the Green chariots fall apart and topple over, giving you a clear path. Only Spyridon's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. Without their aid, Spyridon steers his chariot past you and wins the race!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.404;It is a fine day for racing and the Hippodrome is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt. Spyridon, the star of the Greens, looks at you with scorn as your chariots line up. "I shall endeavour not to embarrass you too much, Your Imperial Majesty," he says through clenched teeth.\n\nThe trumpets blow, and the race begins! One by one, the Green chariots fall apart and topple over, giving you a clear path. Only Spyridon's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. The furious crowds storm the arena in disgust at this blatant attempt by both teams to cheat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.405;As you walk at a brisk pace through an empty corridor in the Imperial Palace, on your way to another tiring meeting with your advisors, you hear a faint whisper from one of the window curtains. After readying your dagger you pull the curtains aside to reveal Anaximandros, the gnome-man who recruited you into chariot racing!\n\n"You! I should have you drawn and quartered," you hiss at the man. "The entire Blue team had their chariots fall out from under them!" Anaximandros smiles at you, and speaks: "Calm yourself, Majesty. Your chariot held together, did it not? I have a new and cunning plan for the next race - one that cannot fail. Your epic victory will be celebrated for centuries to come.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.406;You resume your chariot training and although you are an even better racer now, it still may not be enough to best the other competitors, many of whom have been driving chariots since early childhood. Anaximandros approaches to tell you of his new scheme.\n\n"Behold, Majesty," he says, and produces a small bottle from within his cloak. "One drop of this concoction, which my associates and I only acquired at great cost I might add, is enough to send a man running for the latrines within minutes. Each member of the Green team will be offered some spiced wine by their quartermaster - a man in our employ - just before the race is about to begin. I think you can see where I am going with this, Your Grace...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.407;Once again you ride into the Hippodrome in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Constantinople has turned up for this momentous race. Spyridon, your old nemesis, is instructing the rest of the Green team when their quartermaster offers them a sip of wine to fortify their resolve. All accept this offer, except Spyridon. Instead, he loudly proclaims, he will offer his wine to the Blue team who need it more. Before you can object, the other Blue racers happily share the wine between them...\n\nThe trumpets blare and the race begins. Within seconds the first few racers leap off their chariots, sprinting for the latrines. Soon only you and Spyridon remain. Fortune favours you, however, as Spyridon collides with the last racer to abandon his chariot. This delays him enough to grant you victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.408;Once again you ride into the Hippodrome in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Constantinople has turned up for this momentous race.

Before you can object, the other Blue racers happily share the wine between them...\n\nThe trumpets blare and the race begins. Within seconds the first few racers leap off their chariots, sprinting for the latrines. Soon only you and Spyridon remain and sadly for you, he proves to be the better chariot racer. He overtakes you in the final lap and rides his chariot to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.409;Once again you ride into the Hippodrome in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Constantinople has turned up for this momentous race.

Within seconds the first few racers leap off their chariots, sprinting for the latrines. Soon only you and Spyridon remain, but the crowd is up in arms over this disgraceful display. It is obvious to all that foul play is involved. They jump into the arena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.410;You enjoy a quiet moment away from your advisors under the shade of a tree in the palatial garden. A sound from above catches your attention, and as you look up you spot Anaximandros, the chariot gnome, hiding on a branch. "Your Grace," he whispers with a smile. "Before I suffer your wrath, I ask that you hear me out."\n\nHe scurries down from the tree and gives you his new offer. "Fate may have conspired against us in the past, Majesty, but this time my plan is foolproof." He flashes a toothless grin, the closest he can manage to a winning smile. "Third time's the charm, eh, Your Majesty? What do you say?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.411;Anaximandros brings you to a small workshop in one of the seedier districts of Constantinople. Here, he explains, they will weaponize your chariot. While you watch, the craftsmen install a pair of extendable metal blades into its chassis, intended to shred the wheels of any chariot adjacent to yours.\n\nYou train extensively with the new chariot until you have mastered its new weapons. As you are about to leave for the Hippodrome on the eve of the race, Anaximandros hands you a flanged mace. "For good measure," he explains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.412;This is it, the final race of the season. The Hippodrome is filled to capacity and a deafening roar greets you as you ride your chariot into the arena. You line up next to Spyridon, your old foe from the Greens and the crowd's favorite. "Your Majesty," he says and spits on the ground.\n\nThe trumpets blow and the race begins, but it seems you weren't the only one to have brought arms. Everything turns into a huge melee as all the drivers hack and slash at each other using both handheld and chariot-mounted weaponry. Anaximandros has played both sides against each other - there can be no other explanation. The situation escalates further when the agitated crowds enter the fray. You spot Anaximandros climbing into Spyridon's chariot, and the two of them escape the Hippodrome through the unguarded exit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.413;As Spyridon and the traitor Anaximandros depart the Hippodrome leaving nothing but chaos in their wake, you rally the Varangian Guard to your side. Together with a squadron of cataphracts from the nearby garrison you finally manage to bring order to the madness. The cost of life is great, especially amongst the audience, but it can't be helped.\n\nYour career as a chariot racer is over, but despite everything, you have emerged through all this as the strongwilled leader many feel the Empire needs. You wonder what possible motive compelled Anaximandros to turn the Blue and Green factions against each other in open battle. For how long did he mastermind events with that purpose in mind? You will likely never know. He is now a wanted man throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.414;You leave the madness of the Hippodrome behind and steer your chariot out into the streets of Constantinople, in hot pursuit of Spyridon and the traitor Anaximandros. With blades unfolded, your chariot smashes through market stalls and pottery in the narrow back alleys while a hissing Anaximandros tries to give you a taste of the whip, without success.\n\nYou rush past the Hagia Sophia and onto the Augustaion square as terrified priests scramble to get out of the way. With a sharp turn you continue forward on the Mese, the main thoroughfare, and speed past oxcarts and the Forum of Constantine before Spyridon abruptly turns north, towards the Golden Horn. He finally loses control of his chariot at the docks, and it crashes into some stacked crates. You step out of your chariot and draw your mace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.415;Spyridon has been impaled on a nearby fence and his dead eyes glare at you accusingly. Anaximandros, however, lies wheezing on the docks with a broken leg. He curses your name as you approach him with your mace. "Why do all this?" you ask him. "What could you possibly gain?"\n\nThe little man grins wryly at you. "Eons ago, there were four chariot racing teams: the Blues, the Greens, the Whites and the Reds. Then the two most powerful teams all but absorbed the two weakest. Who speaks of the Whites today? Or the Reds? Where is their glory? The domination of the Blues and Greens had to end, Majesty. At any cost. If my nephew Spyridon and I could get them to wipe each other out..." You have heard enough. With a single blow, your mace forever silences Anaximandros.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.416;Spyridon has been impaled on a nearby fence and his dead eyes glare at you accusingly. Anaximandros, however, lies wheezing on the docks with a broken leg.

Or the Reds? The domination of the Blues and Greens had to end, Majesty. At any cost. If my nephew Spyridon and I could get them to wipe each other out..." You have heard enough. Varangian Guardsmen on horseback finally catch up with you and are instructed to take Anaximandros away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.417;Members of the Varangian Guard leap into the arena in defense of their [Root.GetTitle] and swiftly cut down those rioters foolish enough to approach your chariot. They rush you to the safety of your palace, but the rest of Constantinople burns when the upset crowds spill out of the Hippodrome and onto the streets. As you watch the fires spread from your palatial balcony, you raise your fists to the heavens and bellow at the top of your lungs:\n\n"AAANNNNAAAXIMANDROOOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.500;Chariot races are scheduled to be held soon at the Hippodrome. Eight charioteers from the traditional Blue and Green teams will be competing for glory on the track. You may choose to throw your weight behind one of these factions and bet on them in a show of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.501;It was close, but the Blue team emerged as the winner after a tense final lap. Their triumphant charioteer makes a victory lap to the cheers of the ecstatic crowds. When he passes your seat he bows his head as a sign of respect and gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.502;The Blue team lost the race after a nail-biting final lap. To the cheers of the crowd, the triumphant Green charioteer makes a victory lap. As he passes your seat, he flashes a gloating smile and gives you a little wave. Fortunately, your quick-thinking servants remove your wine cup before you can hurl it at him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.503;It was close, but the Green team emerged as the winner after a tense final lap. Their triumphant charioteer makes a victory lap to the cheers of the ecstatic crowds. When he passes your seat he bows his head as a sign of respect and gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
