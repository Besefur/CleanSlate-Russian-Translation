EVTDESC_HF_43000;As your fight against the infidels continues, large groups of citizens from all around the [Root.Religion.GetName] world has gathered to support your cause. The men are waiting for your orders at [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43250;Suddenly [great_theologian.GetBestName] appear at my doors, asking for a place to stay. Inspired by [theologian_founder.GetFirstNameWithNick], [great_theologian.GetSheHe] has decided that [Root.Capital.GetName] must be one of the closest places to [great_theologian.Religion.GetHighGodName] and will prove essential to [great_theologian.GetHerHis] studies. [great_theologian.GetFirstName] is known throughout the whole [great_theologian.Religion.GetGroupName] realm as one of the truly great minds of our time. It is an honor to have [great_theologian.GetHerHim] around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43300;Convinced I am the latest in the line of great defenders of the faith, as a descendant of [founder_of_zealots.GetFirstNameWithNick], a group of [founder_of_zealots.Religion.GetName] zealots has appeared in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Though assured they are spreading the faith, they are in fact creating chaos among the local populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43301;The zealots continue their rampage in §R[Root.Capital.GetName]§!, unhindered by the soldiers pathetic attempts to stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43302;The zealots are removed from [Root.Capital.GetName] forcefully. Peace returns, and the populace are happy with my leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43303;The zealots continue their wild rampages through §R[Root.Capital.GetName]§! despite my support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43304;The zealots have decided to follow my commands, and have organized into a proper militia at §G[Root.Capital.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43305;The general of the zealots, §Y[zealot_general.GetBestName]§! have decided to join my court, and [zealot_general.GetHerHis] men are stationed at §G[Root.Capital.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43306;The zealots remain unconvinced by my arguments, and continue their frenzy at §R[Root.Capital.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43307;Persuaded by my arguments, the zealots leave and peace returns to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_43400;A message is delivered to you by a [Root.GetMonkOrder]. Your ancestor made an impact on them, and they would like to extend their hand to you in friendship. If you so wish, they will settle some of their monks in [Root.Capital.GetName] to talk to the locals and spread the faithful message of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_43000;I should take advantage of this zealous rabble while they are still assembled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_43250;I am sure I can find a use for [great_theologian.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_43300;Have the men disperse them and restore peace to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_43300_CUSTOM_1;The soldiers fail at restoring order, and the zealots increase their frenzied behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_43300_CUSTOM_2;The zealots are removed, and the people are happy with my leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_43400;A donation to help them out will be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_43300;I will create a better environment for them, so they can spread the faith properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_43300_CUSTOM_1;It is ineffective and the zealots continue their chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_43300_CUSTOM_2;The zealots decide to follow my commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_43300_CUSTOM_3;The zealots and their General decide to follow my commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_43400;I will do them one better, and join the monastic order myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_43300;By the logic of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] I will convince them to leave my people alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_43300_CUSTOM_1;The zealots remain unconvinced and continue their frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_43300_CUSTOM_2;The zealots are persuaded to leave peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_43400;All right, I wish them luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HF_43300;They will probably leave in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
