EVTDESC_RoI_146;My [Root.GetLordLady], the soldiers are reluctant to follow you to India. They are tired of the combat, pain and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_147;My [Root.GetLordLady], there is a mysterious plague on our province of [thugs_province.GetName]. Many travellers and caravans have been disappearing, much more than would be a normal toll of robbers, accidents and disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_148;The agents that we sent out to investigate the unknown menace on the roads have disappeared without trace. We haven't heard from them in months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_149;We have spread much terror and woe in the countryside, my [Root.GetLordLady], and the peasants now seem sufficiently cowed. However, there is no new information on the mysterious disappearances. It would seem that the peasants really know nothing about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_150;My [Root.GetLordLady], the problem of the disappearing caravans persists. Perhaps we should try sending large parties of soldiers to scout after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_151;A young traveller has come forward, claiming he has important information about the disappearing caravans. He says he wants the gold reward, but asks to see you personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_152;The young man enters the throne room, looking around cautiously. He looks up and says he has brought good information, then reaches inside his jacket. He pulls out... a throwing knife! He throws it at you, shouting: 'Our Mother Kali will harvest what is hers!' [saving_courtier.GetFullName] reacts and throws [saving_courtier.GetHerselfHimself] in front of you, saving your life but sacrificing [saving_courtier.GetHerHis] own, with a knife through the heart. The strange youth quickly escapes, running past the surprised guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_153;A council is held after the assassination attempt. Your advisors all agree that this menace must be dealt with forcefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_155;Your riders have still not been able to find any clues regarding the attacks, though at least the caravans they accompany in strength are safe. Also, it has been noted that short-range caravans seem to never be attacked in the same way, only the longer-travelling ones. Strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_156;Several months have passed since you ordered large military escorts for all long-range caravans in the province of [thugs_province.GetName]. In this time, no caravans have disappeared. Travellers and merchants can once again breathe easily. It still irks you that you will never know who did it. There are rumours, however, of an increased number of disappeared caravans in several neighboring provinces...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_157;A delegation from your subjects has arrived. Large-scale forest clearing work is being done in one of your provinces. Recent illness among the elephants means the peasants don't have enough of the animals to be able to finish in time before the rainy season. They ask you to lend them elephants to speed up the work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_158;An elephant has gone crazy and is running amuck in the town outside the castle. It has already killed several people - what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_159;Several soldiers were severely injured, but they managed to kill the elephant. The animal died screaming, spilling a whole river of blood all over the street. The peasants are very upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_160;The soldiers managed to lure the elephant to a safe area and then kill it with spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_161;It was impossible to capture the crazed beast. It killed several more people, flattened a couple of buildings and then ran off into the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_162;A couple of veteran elephant handlers managed to snare and capture the elephant. It has been brought safely to the pens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_163;A priest from the local temple has arrived, asking speak with you: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], the holy elephants at the temple are all sick. However, we have learned that there is a healer in a neighboring province who is famous for healing ailing elephants. He is, however, most expensive...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_164;My [Root.GetLordLady], messengers have arrived from the great [white_elephant_donor.GetFullName]. It seems [white_elephant_donor.GetSheHe] has decided to honor you with the grandest of all gifts, a white elephant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_165;You will need to build a proper stable for your white elephant. It is a unique and holy animal and must have an abode fitting its status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_166;My [Root.GetLordLady], the guards keeping watch over your white elephant report that they have caught some trespassers. It seems they are members of a rather strange local Ganesha cult, and they have been stealing the white elephant's dung for worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_167;Your white elephant has still not gotten used to its new housing, and it seems restless and bored. Last night it got worse, it started kicking around and going on a rampage, almost tearing the whole place apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_168;My [Root.GetLordLady], there is a problem with your white elephant. Yesterday, it broke out from its stable and ran out into to the nearby fields. Once there, it immediately attempted to mate with several elephants - this desire may actually have been the reason for its escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_169;If you truly wish to kill the White Elephant, you must decide how to proceed, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Whichever method we employ, we should try to make it look like an accident so as to avoid insulting the person who gave it to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_170;The caretakers poison the white elephant's drinking water. The elephant soon starts to wail in pain and becomes quite sick. It is a slow poison, and it takes several days for the beast to expire. Everyone is very concerned and very sad at this sudden 'illness'. No one suspects that you had the elephant poisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_171;The caretakers poison the white elephant's drinking water. The elephant soon starts to wail in pain and becomes quite sick, vomiting blood and dying within minutes. Most people think it very strange that such a healthy animal suddenly died so quickly. Rumor quickly spreads that you had it poisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_172;You instruct the caretakers to stop feeding the elephant. The animal gets progressively weaker and weaker until one morning it is found dead. You have your servants and medics complain loudly about the animal having been sick and refusing to eat. Everyone is sad, but no one suspects foul play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_173;You instruct the caretakers to stop feeding the elephant. The animal gets progressively weaker and weaker until one morning it is found dead. Word gets out, however, that your servants had stopped delivering food to the stable and soon it is common knowledge that you starved the elephant to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_174;You arrange to bring the white elephant on an official procession very near some high cliffs. At the right moment, the guards prod the elephant with spears and drive it over the cliff, and it falls to its death. You swiftly have the guards spread the news of the terrible accident. Everyone is shocked, but no one suspects your involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_175;You arrange to bring the white elephant on an official procession very near some high cliffs. At the right moment, the guards prod the elephant with spears and drive it over the cliff, and it falls to its death. Unluckily, however, some hunters passing by witnessed the whole incident, and rumor of your bloody deed swiftly spread throughout the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_176;You send twenty soldiers armed with lances into the white elephant's stable. They attack and swiftly kill the animal in a few very noisy and bloody moments. Everyone knows it was done on your direct orders, and that's exactly the way you want it to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_177;The white elephant seems to be a lot calmer now, and hasn't broken anything or injured anyone in quite a while. It seems that perhaps our troubles with it are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_180;A group of wandering Buddhist monks have come to visit the province. They are staging impressive shows of acrobatic unarmed fighting techniques in the villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_190;A strange man has approached you, seeking audience with you. He claims he is an 'engineer' and he wishes to build a boat that can travel under water and sail it up the Indus. All he needs is a sponsor for the project. If you help him, he will name the boat after you - 'a you-boat', he jokes, smiling nervously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_191;The 'engineer' spent many days building his underwater boat. In the end it was finished and he set out, submerging the craft to the sound of amazed murmuring from the great crowd gathered along the shore. A faint trail of bubbles could be seen as the boat navigated underwater up the river.\nAlas, he was never seen nor heard of again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_193;It is rumored that a sacred yogi has mastered the art of levitation, and that he can be seen at a marketplace nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_194;You arrive at the marketplace. There is a large crowd gathered around the yogi. He does indeed seem to be levitating above the ground, eyes closed. Someone mutters that he has been still like that for several hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_195;You leave the levitating yogi, pondering the magical mysteries of these holy men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_196;You poke the yogi. He blinks, then regains his composure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_197;The yogi opens his eyes, irritated. He steps down and leaves without a word. The rest of the crowd eyes you with disapproval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_198;You take step back, then throw yourself forward, giving the yogi a forceful shove. He topples over with a frightened screech, hitting his head on the ground. The crowd stares in stunned silence at you and the yogi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_203;A Hindu yogi has appeared at your court, seeking audience. He speaks of the many Hindu gods and how to reach for wisdom and power by honoring them and follow the wisdom of the Mahabharata.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_204;The yogi continues to elaborate on the way of ascetism and yoga and how to live a spiritual life through discipline and mediation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_206;A Buddhist yogi has appeared at your court, seeking audience. He speaks to you of the ways of the Buddha and of how to reach wisdom by rejecting excess and moderating your desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_209;A naked Jain ascetic has appeared at your court, seeking audience. Sitting before you in the throne room, he criticizes your lifestyle, calls you sinful and speaks to you of the Jain ways of harmony and purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_210;The naked Jain ascetic continues to elaborate on the way of ascetism and yoga and how to seek spiritual purity through discipline and mediation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_215;My [Root.GetLordLady], a huge diamond has been found in a mine in one of your provinces. It is truly one of those stones that are found once every five centuries! The only question now is, of course: what do you wish to do with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_216;As you sit in your throne room, the huge diamond sparkles in your magnificent crown. It casts a lustrous brilliance over everyone present, a brilliance that echoes in your reputation across the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_217;You are riding with a troops of soldiers through a nearby town, returning from inspecting your lands. You are wearing your magnificent crown. Suddenly, someone jumps at you from an overhanging roof and tries to grab your crown. The thief misses, however, and breaks his neck in the fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_218;You are out in the countryside, inspecting forest-clearing work being done by your subjects. You are wearing your magnificent crown. As usual, elephants are employed for the heavy work. The sun catches your huge diamond and it sparkles wildly, blinding a nearby elephant who panics! The animal rampages through your company, injuring several people severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_220;Sleeping in bed at night, you wake to the sound of furtive footsteps. As you sit up, you see [target_courtier.GetFullName] in the process of removing your diamond crown from its place near your bed. As you cry out, [target_courtier.GetSheHe] pulls a knife and stabs at you. You scream, and moments later your guards enter and seize the thief. Enraged, you order [target_courtier.GetHerHim] executed on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_221;You are busy ruling your realm, but in your free moments you take a pause to think of that beautiful large diamond that is hidden safe in your treasury. You are certain that no one else in the world has such a precious treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_222;Lately, you find yourself spending more and more time in your treasury. You go down there to look at your lovely diamond. It really is lovely. When one has such a treasure, one doesn't need people.\nPeople don't sparkle, they wither and die. Diamonds are forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_223;One day, your guard captain comes before you with grave news: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], something terrible has happened! Thieves broke into your treasury last night and stole the great diamond. Nothing else is missing.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_224;Lately, you have been sleeping badly. You worry about your great diamond. You know it should be safe in the treasury, but when you don't see it you worry. Have you really taken all precautions to keep it safe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_226;Your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] is very pleased with the magnificent diamond. [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] keeps it with [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] all the time, relishing the admiration it attracts from everyone who sees it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_228;Your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] comes to see you, in tears. [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] tells you that the grand diamond that you gave to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] has been stolen while [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] was riding through a market town. There is no trace of the thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_230;You are worried about your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]. Lately, [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] mostly sits around in [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] room, fondling [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] great diamond and talking to [Root.Spouse.GetHerselfHimself]. [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] doesn't even answer anymore when you try to talk to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_232;The captain of your guard comes to see you, sweating, terror in his eyes. He tells you that [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has been murdered on the road, by robbers probably wanting to get their hands on the great diamond! A patrol of soldiers arrived just as the crime was committed, however, killing the robbers and retrieving the treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_240;Apart from more serious events, you have found that a lot of little strange, bad things happen around the great diamond. Several servants who have handled it have died. People around whisper and gossip, they say the diamond is cursed and will bring woe on your dynasty. You are beginning to wonder if they may not be right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_241;You sold the great diamond, but now you find that you really miss it. Maybe if you sent riders after the merchants, you could still get it back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_242;The riders you sent after the diamond return. They explain that the merchant who bought the jewel refused to sell it back, and when they insisted a fight broke out. The merchant has been killed but your men managed to retreive the diamond. As things turned out, you got to keep your money as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_243;You threw the magnificent diamond in the river, but now you miss it terribly. Perhaps it'd still be possible to find if you went and looked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_244;You send your men to search the river where you threw the diamond in, but to no avail. Frustrated, you dive in yourself. You wade and swim back and forth, searching for hours, but it's useless, you just can't find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_245;One morning when you wake up, you realize that your precious diamond is gone! Someone has stolen it while you were sleeping, from your very bedchamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_247;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is very upset at your accusation. You hold [From.GetHerHim] in the dungeon while [From.GetHerHim] quarters are searched, but nothing is found. After a while, you start to doubt - perhaps you were mistaken in your suspicion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_400;It seems that my interest in the Indian religions has come to the attention of one of their practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_401;You have received a visitor - an emissary from the famous university at Nalanda. He tells of you of the research and other work they do there and offers you a formal invitation to visit and see this marvel of Bihar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_402;You have arrived at the magnificent University of Nalanda. It's a massive complex of red brick buildings, busy with a bustle of scholars and monks. You have been told that people come here from all over India and beyond in order to study and exchange ideas. The library has a huge amount of texts in every language known to man.\n\nIt's an impresssive place. You don't have much time to spend here, however, so you need to decide what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_403;Ganges is the embodiment of all sacred waters in Hindu mythology and is personified in the goddess Ganga. As you live fairly close to this great river, your Upadhyaya suggests that you make a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_404;You have arrived at the banks of the Ganges. You enter a temple at the banks of the river, avoiding the throng of the common pilgrims. The sacred waters offer a ritual of purification and will strengthen your link to the divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_410;Priests from a local Hindu temple have approached you, asking for donations. They need to expand the temple with a new building in order to accomodate the growing number of worshipers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_411;Monks from a local monastery have approached you, asking for donations. They need to accomodate the rising number of worshipers and still have enough provisions to maintain their other work and studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_412;There have been increasing complaints from merchants in the nearby town lately. It seems a number of naked Jain ascetics have taken to sit and preach in the main square. The merchants say they understand the need to respect other religions, but the naked ascetics are driving away customers and upsetting people's sensitivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_500;Some traveling merchants from Europe have arrived, seeking audience. They say they are from Venice and are on a long journey to reach the court of the Khan in in the far east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_501;The merchants turn out to be brothers, going by the names of Niccoló Polo and Matteo Polo, and Niccoló's son Marco is also traveling with them. They petition you to provide an escort or guides for travelling east through your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_502;The Polo brothers thank you gratefully for your assistance. The next day they set off eastwards, strengthened by the aid you have provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_503;The Polo brothers thank you for the audience. After spending the night in town, they set off again the next day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_504;You have received an unexpected visit! The Venetian merchants Niccoló, Matteo and Marco Polo have once again arrived at your court. They explain that they reached the Far East and are now returning after a successful voyage, wanting to stop at your palace to thank you for the valuable aid you offered when they last came by. And they have brought gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10001;My little [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has an odd birthmark that closely matches that of my [GetFromReincarnationRelation], [From.Reincarnation.GetBestName]. Could [From.Reincarnation.GetSubjectPronoun] have been reborn as my [GetFromRelation] in this life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10002;Sometimes I think of my other family, when I was an old [Root.Reincarnation.GetManWoman]. Where are all my old friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10003;My beloved [GetFromRelation] is showing every sign of being my reborn [GetFromReincarnationRelation] [From.Reincarnation.GetFirstName]. Little [From.GetFirstName] often speaks of [From.GetPossPronoun] old friends and family, even naming many correctly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10010;My tutors say that they see more of my [GetReincarnationRelation] [Root.Reincarnation.GetFirstName] in me every day, even though my own vague memories of that past life are fading fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10011;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], [From.Reincarnation.GetTitledFirstName] reborn, is acting more like [From.GetPossPronoun] previous incarnation every day! [From.GetFirstName] is definitely expressing another of [From.Reincarnation.GetFirstName]'s personality traits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10020;[Root.Reincarnation.Killer.GetFirstName]!' you scream as you wake up from a horrible nightmare of being killed. As your guards come rushing in, you calm down and realize that it was no ordinary dream. You remember the name of the one who had you murdered in your previous life as [Root.Reincarnation.GetBestName] - the evil [Root.Reincarnation.Killer.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10021;As you gaze idly into the pond, a feeling of deep love suddenly comes over you, and then, the sweetest memory. You remember making love to your beloved [Root.Reincarnation.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Reincarnation.Spouse.GetFirstName] by another pool of water, in another forest, in another life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RoI_10022;Watching a group of children at play, you suddenly remember another child, little [target_child.GetFirstName], who was yours when you were in the world as [Root.Reincarnation.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RoI_160;Ah, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_163;How unfortunate for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_164;I will accept this gracious gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RoI_168;From now on, make sure it gets weekly 'exercise'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_169;Poison it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_176;It had to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_177;Let's hope so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RoI_241;Send riders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_242;I will sleep with it under my pillow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_243;It's not too late to correct my mistake. We will search for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_244;It's gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_245;It must have been my wife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_247;It seems to me that [From.GetSheHe] is innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_400;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_401;Interesting - I will accept the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_402;I will focus on studying the architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_403;I will go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_404;I descend into the water and Ganga washes away my sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Shiva statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_411;Give them gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_412;Why do you bother me with this petty nonsense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_500;Bring them before me, I shall speak to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_501;I will provide seasoned guides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_502;I wish them a good journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_503;What strange men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_504;Come, tell me tales of the East, my friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10001;Such is [From.Reincarnation.GetHerHis] Karma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10002;I miss them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10003;I wonder how alike [From.Reincarnation.GetFirstName] [From.GetSubjectPronoun] will become...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10010;I just feel like... me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10011;How remarkable is Samsara - the cycle of rebirth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10020;That vicious spawn of a Rakshasi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10021;Ah, [Root.Reincarnation.Spouse.GetFirstName] my love, where are you now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10022;How the wheel turns...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_100;All-powerful, crowned Vishnu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_101;Ganesha, the remover of obstacles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_110;Vaishnavism, revering Vishnu as supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_110_ALT;I shall follow the Vaishnavism tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_111;Vajrayana, of the Two Truths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_111_ALT;Vajrayana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_112;Svetambara, the white-clad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_112_ALT;Svetambara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_117;I am now a Svetambara Jain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_117_ALT;I am now a Svetambara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_146;Onward! They will learn to fear us in the East as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_147;The sufferings of commoners are nothing to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_148;Burn farms and hang peasants until the truth comes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_149;No one is wholly innocent. Now let's forget this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_150;No, we will offer a large money reward for information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_153;No, this is too dangerous. Leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_155;Give it up, this takes up too many resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_157;I can't spare my elephants, but I will send soldiers to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_158;Try to capture it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_163;I shall pay for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_164;I will not accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_165;A normal elephant pen will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_166;No harm done, give them the droppings as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_167;I've had enough, return this cursed gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_168;I've had enough, return the lecherous beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_169;Let's just starve it to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_180;They had better not teach those things to my peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_190;'You-boat?' Get out. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_193;I have no time for superstitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_194;Fascinating! I must donate money to this holy man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_196;Leave him alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_203;If you have finished talking, you may leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_204;You are wise. I shall take up the Hindu faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_207;You are wise. I shall take up the Buddhist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_209;Put some clothes on, man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_210;You are wise. I shall take up the Jain faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_215;I will hide it in the treasury, where it's safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_240;Throw it in the river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_241;No, it's over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_243;Leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_245;It must have been my own blood who did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_247;No, [From.GetSheHe] must be guilty - execute [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_401;I don't have the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_402;I think I will spend a few days in the library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_403;I have no time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Vishnu statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_411;Give them food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_412;We will ask the ascetics to move to a less prominent location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_500;These people do not interest me. Send them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_501;I will provide seasoned guides and an armed escort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_10001;No, this Atman is different;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_10003;Remarkable, but I want [From.GetObjectPronoun] raised as a new person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_100;Mighy Brahma, He of four faces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_101;Ganga of the waters, She who purifies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_110;Shaktism, revering Shakti, the feminine divine, as supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_110_ALT;I shall follow the Shaktism tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_111;Theravada, of the Pali Canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_111_ALT;Theravada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_148;Give up, this is clearly hopeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_157;Your problems are not my concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_166;Let them work in the stables. We will pay them with dung.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_167;Sell the damned thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_168;Hmm, maybe we could sell it for breeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_169;Push it over a cliff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_194;Let's poke him and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_196;Give him a good shove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_203;I don't need your strange, pathetic demon-gods. Guards, throw him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_204;On second thought, this is perhaps not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_206;I don't need your pseudo-philosophy. Guards, throw him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_207;On second thought, this is perhaps not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_209;Call me sinful, will you? Guards, take him out and behead him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_210;On second thought, this is perhaps not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_215;I will give it to my [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife], [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_240;No, it's my precious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_245;I know it was someone on my council!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_402;I have come to receive religious instruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Brahma statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_411;This is none of my concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_412;My soldiers will throw these heathens out town!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RoI_501;I'm sure they they can manage on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_100;There are other powerful deities as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_101;On second thought, I shall associate myself with one of the Trimurti...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_110;Smartism, revering the oneness of many gods as supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_110_ALT;I shall follow the Smartism tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_167;This stupid animal needs to die - now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_168;Kill this elephant. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_169;I don't care who's insulted. Send in the soldiers with lances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_194;I think I'll give him a hard shove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_215;It's worth a fortune, sell it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_240;I cannot live with it nor without it. I must swallow it and kill myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_245;I think I know who it was...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Kali statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Ganesha statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_RoI_410;I will help you. Make sure you put in a large Ganga statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_RoI_410;I will help you with a small donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_RoI_410;I'm sorry, I don't have the funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
