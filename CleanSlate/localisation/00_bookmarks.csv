BM_100_YEARS_WAR_DESC;The death of French King Charles IV in 1328 with no immediate heir triggered a succession dispute that would last for over a hundred years. Edward III of England was the closest living male heir, but the French nobility, balking at the prospect of a foreign king, claimed the line could not pass through a woman, and crowned another pretender - Philip. Nine years later, war broke out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_100_YEARS_WAR_ERA;Late Middle Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_100_YEARS_WAR_ERA_INFO;Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_CHARLEMAGNE_DESC;The Early Middle Ages started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century. The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FATE_OF_ENGLAND_ERA_INFO;By the late 10th and early 11th centuries the Muslim world was changing, with Turkish dynasties such as the Seljuks and Ghaznavids now dominating Persia. The Byzantine Empire was still holding its own but was to see worse times coming. Central and Western continental Europe was split between France and a strong Holy Roman Empire, while Christian kings were advancing against a fractured and weakened Muslim Spain. Scandinavia was quickly converting to Christianity, and the Norse settlers in Russia and Britain had become assimilated with the local populations. Yet Viking descendants in Normandy and Italy were preparing new conquests, and the time of the First Crusade was approaching...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KOMNENOS_DYNASTY_DESC;After a series of devastating losses to invading Turkish forces, the Byzantine Empire is reeling. But there is hope - the great general Alexios Komnenos has just seized the throne from the corrupt Nikephoros III. Alexios - whose life was documented by his daughter Anna in 'the Alexiad' - and his successors would halt the decline of the Empire and push back the Turkish invaders from western Anatolia, buying more time for the ailing remnants of the old Roman Empire. For now, Anatolia is ruled by Suleyman I, a member of the Seljuk dynasty, who arrogantly calls his new state the 'Sultanate of Rum' (Rome).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_RISE_OF_THE_HANSA_DESC;The burghers of the Imperial Free Cities of Lübeck and Hamburg in Northern Germany have just formed a trade alliance that will eventually become known as the Hanseatic League. Meanwhile, the terrible Mongol Horde has swept like a scythe through Eastern Europe, effortlessly mowing down all opposition. As even the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II cowers in fear, the great invasion suddenly comes to an inexplicable halt as both Batu Khan of the Golden Horde and Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate return to Karakorum to elect a new Great Khan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_LATIN_EMPIRE;The Latin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_LATIN_EMPIRE_DESC;The notorious and ill fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_THE_MONGOLS_DESC;After uniting the warring steppe tribes under a single banner for the first time, the great warlord Temujin, or Genghis Khan as he now styles himself, has set out to expand his growing empire further. In Central Asia, Mongolian envoys to Ala ed-Din of Khwarezm have been massacred and this is an insult the Great Khan cannot ignore. He has led his armies west and now stands poised to punish the powerful Muslim realm for its insolence. Like a coiled spring, the massed Mongol armies are ready to be unleashed upon the world. Where will they stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_MONGOLS_ERA;Age of the Mongols;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_MONGOLS_ERA_INFO;As Europe entered the 13th century, Constantinople had been weakened by the Turks and sacked by the Fourth Crusade, so the Byzantine Empire was very much weakened. The Turks still reigned in the Middle East and Persia, in India many new kingdoms vied for power after the fall of the old dynasties. The Norman conquest had brought new political and dynastic struggles to England and France, the Christian kingdoms in Spain were continually growing stronger, Scandinavia had left paganism behind and was becoming more centralized. In Russia several principalities struggled for power in the shadow of the Bolghars and Cumans to the east. In Germany and Italy, the Holy Roman Empire still stood firm, but beyond all this, to the east, a new power was to come into play. When the Mongols broke into Eastern Europe and Persia, it changed the balance of power in all of Western Eurasia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_THE_OLD_GODS_ERA;Viking Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_OLD_GODS_ERA_INFO;By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHALUKYA;Chalukya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_140;William the Conqueror, a descendant of the Viking chief Rollo, became duke of Normandy at a very young age, a situation compounded by the fact that he was also a bastard. Early on he was constantly being used as a pawn by rival factions in the duchy, with a succession of his guardians being murdered. Once he reached adulthood, he faced years of warfare in order to take full control over his duchy, eventually emerging victorious. In 1066 he successfully invaded England to press a claim on the English throne. He spent the remainder of his reign consolidating and reforming his new kingdom in the face of sometimes fierce opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1128;Robert Guiscard was the sixth son of Tancred de Hauteville, a petty Norman lord. Just like his brothers, he left Normandy with a small force of followers to seek his fortune in Italy. A brilliant and ruthless leader, he spent several years building a reputation as a mercenary, and the ever changing political landscape in Italy eventually saw the pope investing him as Duke of Apulia. In further campaigns, he proceeded to conquer Sicily, fighting both the Saracens and the Byzantines to secure control. He thus established Norman rule in southern Italy and his conquests had a profound long term impact on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1282;Otto was crowned King of the Germans after the death of his father Henry I. Early in his reign he had to push back a rebellion by Duke Eberhard of Bavaria, as well as fight a war against Louis IV of West-Francia and Duke Gilbert of Lorraine. After securing peace in the war, Otto went on to fight for the Italian throne as well as push back the Hungarian threat in the east. In his later years, after his coronation as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he had to continue his struggles in Italy to keep his newfound empire under control. The Ottonian dynasty went on to control the empire for almost half a century after his death, until it finally ended with the demise of Henry II in 1024.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1316;Heinrich was the son of Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich III, and like his father before him became King of the Germans at a very young age. He nearly drowned at the age of 12 when trying to escape a kidnapping at the hands of the Archbishop of Cologne during an ultimately successful political coup against his mother for the regency. Once an adult, he spent a lot of time balancing between the many powerful interest groups within his vast empire. He fought several wars against rebellious princes and against the Pagan Slavs. Heinrich also had a bitter controversy with the Pope Gregory VII over investiture, leading to his excommunication. Faced with possible rebellion in the Empire, Heinrich was forced to humiliate himself by standing on his knees in a blizzard for three days at Canossa while awaiting the Pope's pardon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1700;Basil the Macedonian was born to simple peasant parents in Macedonia. After a tumultuous early life, he eventually entered the service of relatives of the imperial house. With time, he became a friend and confidant of Emperor Michael. Using his position to advance his interests, he soon became co-emperor and eventually murdered Michael to become sole emperor. Once in power, he developed a reputation for efficiency and dedication to the empire. He restored good relations with the Pope and strengthened the eastern frontier in spite of hard-fought wars with the Paulicians and the Arabs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3040;Alp Arslan, great-grandson of Seljuk, was born Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri, but his strength, personal combat skills and valor were soon to earn him his honorary name, which means 'Heroic Lion'. Early on, he succeeded his father as governor of Khorasan, and after a succession crisis in 1064 he took the title of Sultan by force of arms, and became ruler of the immense Seljuk Empire. He then made war on the Byzantine Empire, defeating them thoroughly at the famous battle of Manzikert and taking the Emperor prisoner. This victory was a first step towards Turkish domination in Anatolia and was one of the major events triggering the crusades. He died true to his name, at the age of 42, refusing to let his guards help him against a rebel prisoner who came at him with a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3096;Born in Cairo, Al-Mustansir became Caliph when he was only 6 years old. During his early years, his mother Ma'd Abu Tamim acted as regent and saw to her son's safety. Once he became an adult, his reign was dominated by strong Viziers, and also plagued by chaos as famine weakened the realm and powerful groups of Turkish mercenaries dominated Egypt and struggled for power. Al-Mustansir never fully took the reins of power, but he was to become the longest-reigning Caliph in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6392;Son of Pepin the Short and a descendant of Charles Martel, Charlemagne (or Karl, as his contemporaries called him) became joint king of the Franks with his brother Karloman in 769. After a two-year power struggle, Karloman suddenly and conveniently fell ill and died, leaving Karl as sole ruler of the Franks.  He then proceeded to make the kingdom greater than ever before, conquering Saxony, Lombardy and other lands with equal measures of good strategic planning and ruthlessness. He was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by pope Leo III, and his descendants were to rule large parts of Europe for a long time to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30809;Isabelle was born in 1212 in southern Italy as the only child of Maria de Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem. Her mother died shortly after giving birth, and the newborn Isabelle was proclaimed Queen with her father Jean de Brienne acting as her regent. At the age of 13, Isabelle was wed to the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II, effectively being used as a pawn to encourage the Emperor to participate in the Fifth Crusade. The wedding saw the Emperor crowned King of Jerusalem and Isabelle’s father stripped of all his powers. Isabelle herself was kept in seclusion by her husband. She lost a baby daughter before herself dying while giving birth to her son Conrad in 1228. Shortly after her death, Friedrich finally embarked on the promised crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_32901;Al-Qaim followed his father, Caliph al-Mahdi, as he settled down in Ifriqiya and established the Fatimid Caliphate. In direct opposition to the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, they filled the room left behind as the Abbasids had lost control of their peripheral regions. Early in al-Qaim's reign, a large rebellion rose up in the west led by Abu Yazid. For several years the Fatimid armies were pushed back, as the rebellion grew ever closer to their capital in Mahdia. After al-Qaim's death, his son and successor al-Mansur finally managed to beat the rebellion back and take control of their lands once again. The dynasty would later go on to invade Ikhshidid Egypt and establish Cairo as the new capital of their Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_33350;As the son of Edward the Elder, he gained the Kingdom of Mercia after the death of his father, and Wessex after the death of his brother only weeks afterwards. Waging war against the Norsemen in York, Æthelstan pushed northwards and took the city in 927, becoming the first king of a truly united England. Ten years later, in 937, a coalition led by the Kings of Scotland, Strathclyde, and Dublin waged war against Æthelstan, which ended with the Battle of Brunanburh. With a decisive victory it seemed Æthelstan had finally secured his rule in England, but only two years later he died and was succeeded by his half-brother Edmund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_34002;Al-Mansur became sole ruler of the Caliphate after the death of his brother. After defeating several potential challengers to his rule, he led a long and relatively stable reign over his huge empire. His time in power saw the rise of new Islamic literature and scholarship, thanks to cultural tolerance, conversion of new peoples and groups to Islam and a further inclusion of the Persian world into the Caliphate. His reign also saw tentative diplomatic contacts with realms as far away as China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_34014;Al-Mu'tazz became Caliph in 866, at only 19 years of age, in a situation where the Abbasid Empire was rife with power struggles between different factions. After a very bloody period of dealing with his various enemies he looked like he was coming out on top, but by then his coffers were empty and a rebellion among the soldiers turned his fortunes around. In the end he was taken prisoner, beaten and locked in a room to starve to death. He was 24 years old when he died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_40605;Rurik was a viking of Swedish origin who took advantage of the internal struggles of the tribes around Ladoga to conquer and establish a strong Norse realm in the east. His successors expanded their influence and eventually ruled as far south as Kiev, and the dynasty soon also adopted the Slavic language and customs (as Viking settlers often did). The descendants of Rurik would eventually become the first Tsars of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_73679;Abd-al-Rahman I was born near Damascus in Syria, but had to flee his homeland when the Abbasids took power. He spent several years in exile before arriving in Spain, where he managed to seize power and declare himself ruler of Al-Andalus. He wanted to return east and avenge himself on the Abbasids, but the need to deal with issues closer to home kept preventing him from doing so. He instead set his mark on the history of Spain, establishing the rule of his dynasty there for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_74413;Krishna I of the Rashtrakuta dynasty took power in 756, defeating several competitors for the throne in order to secure his realm.

He was also a great patron to builders and commissioned many new temples and monuments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_74441;Somesvara I became king of the Western Chalukyas in 1042, after which he founded the city of Kalyani and made it his capital. He was a very active and energetic ruler but spent most of his reign fighting wars against a succession of rulers from the Chola Dynasty, who were his rivals for domination of Vengi. Unable to achieve victory against his enemies and tormented by an incurable illness, Somesvara ultimately took his own life by drowning himself in the Tungabhadra River.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_90104;When Louis the Pious died, civil war broke out in the Carolingian Empire between his sons due to disagreements over the inheritance. In the settlement that followed the war, Charles was given West Francia. Once Lothair died, however, the balance of power was broken and Charles fought long and bitterly with his brother Ludwig over primacy and over the lands that Lothar had left behind. After Ludwig's death, Charles tried to make a grab for the German lands, but he died during the resulting war in 877 while crossing the Alps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_90107;After making peace with his brothers at the Treaty of Verdun, Ludwig ruled over East Francia and Bavaria, lands that he had already administrated before his father's death. After this, he was locked in constant struggles to expand his power in the Frankish Empire, sometimes allying with his brother Charles the Bald and sometimes fighting him. He was also engaged with suppressing rebellions in Saxony and fighting wars on the Moravian border. He was a great sponsor of the church, using it as a means to suppress pagan subjects, and Germany started to develop its own identity as a kingdom during his reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_93052;Inheriting the Khwarezmian Empire after the death of his father, Mohammed was immediately faced with an invasion by the Ghurids. Several chaotic years of intermittent war between the Khwarezmids, Ghurids and the Kara-Khitans ensued. Mohammed was at one point taken prisoner and held captive in the Kara-Khitan Khanate for a year, but changing fortunes would see him come out on top against his enemies, and he eventually managed to conquer Samarkand, Balochistan and Afghanistan and declare himself Shah. His reign came to an end sooner than expected, however, as Genghis Khan and the Mongols entered the scene in 1218. Within two short years, the Mongols had overrun his domain and he died a fugitive on a small island in the Caspian Sea in 1220.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_98003;Béla IV came from the long lineage of the Árpád rulers of Hungary. He refused to swear fealty to the Mongol Khan Ögödei and thus was faced with a Mongol invasion of Hungary. All seemed lost but salvation came with the death of Ögödei in 1242 since Batu of the Golden Horde ordered the army to safeguard the election of a new Great Khan back in Asia. Béla spent the following years building his kingdom in preparation for another Mongol invasion and became known as the Second Founder of the State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_125501;Temujin was born in Mongolia, the son of the leader of the Borjigin clan. He was only a child when his father died, and he and his mother were ostracized from the clan due to his young age and competing pretenders. Once he reached maturity, however, Temujin began to forge his own destiny. Over several decades, he increased his reputation and prestige among his people, and eventually led them in the successful conquest of all Mongolia. After this, he went on to conquer northern China, all of Central Asia and parts of Persia and the western steppes. He became recognized as one of the greatest conquerors in the history of humanity, and the Mongols would continue expanding on these conquests after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_144001;Hakon was one of the many many sons of Harald Fairhair, legendary king of Norway. When his brother Eirik took control of Norway, not many years passed until his despotic rule made him unpopular to the point of rebellion. Hakon who had been raised by King Æthelstan of England was sent back home to Norway to take over the rule of the kingdom. As a christian in a very pagan country, he had a long and tenuous rule over the many norwegian tribes. Throughout his rule he was threatened by the Danish king who supported the claims of his grandsons, the sons of his half-brother Eirik. In the end Hakon fell as he repelled the Danes at the Battle of Fitjar, and was succeeded by his nephew Harald II Greycloak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_144999;Karloman became joint king of the Franks together with his brother Karl in 768. The two brothers were not friends, rather a rivalry ensued. Karloman was outmaneuvered by his brother's alliance with the Lombards, and sought the support of the Pope in order to counter this, but did ultimately not succeed. He died unexpectedly in 771, just as war for the Frankish crown seemed inevitable. It has been claimed that he was poisoned, but this was never proven...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_159135;As the third grand prince of the Hungarians and the successor to the legendary Árpád, Zolta led their people for several decades in the early 10th century.

He then sought out new adventures and eventually died as a Viking on another bold expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_167219;The Hanseatic League was a loose alliance of German cities centered on Lübeck that dominated Baltic trade in the late Middle Ages and beyond, after displacing Visby as the leading merchant power in the region. Offices, so-called 'kontors,' were opened in major ports and trading hubs everywhere from London in the west to Novgorod in the east. Eventually the League became powerful enough to challenge larger realms directly, such as when they sacked the Danish capital of Copenhagen in the second half of the 14th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_170193;Mystery surrounds Iltutmish’s early years, though it is said he was named for an eclipse that occurred during his birth. He was sold into slavery at an early age, and eventually ended up being bought by Aibak, the ruler of Lahore. Aibak valued his new servant highly and kept giving Iltutmish increasing responsibilities and corresponding honors, eventually marrying him to his own daughter. When Aibak died in 1210, Iltutmish enjoyed strong support as he claimed the throne. Years of turmoil ensued as he fought off contenders and then strengthened his position. He subsequently managed to avoid open conflict with the Mongols, founding the Delhi Sultanate that was to last into the 16th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_170258;Muhammad II was the head of the Tughluq dynasty, which had carved out a vast Muslim empire in India. Under him, the empire initially expanded to temporarily control most of India, but it was not to last. Muhammad had a well-earned reputation for ruthlessness and cruelty, and taxes in his empire were raised to exorbitant levels. He had to contend with numerous revolts, and by the time of his death the realm had already begun to fragment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_190347;Desiderius became King of the Lombards in 756 after putting down the revolt of his rival Ratchis. Throughout his reign, he was constantly in competition with the popes and the southern dukes for domination of Italy.

Eventually the kingdom was invaded and conquered by the Franks, making Desiderius the last Lombard king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_212513;Referred to by contemporaries as stupor mundi, the 'wonder of the world,' Friedrich II was among the most powerful and influential emperors of the Holy Roman Empire during the Middle Ages. His reign was marked with frequent wars against the Papacy, and Friedrich was excommunicated four times - Pope Gregory IX even dubbed him the Antichrist. He managed to broker the return of Jerusalem to Christian control during the Sixth Crusade despite taking part in very little actual fighting. After dying of dysentry in 1250 at the age of 55, his line would quickly die out, resulting in the end of the House of Hohenstaufen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_260976;Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id started the Qarmatian faith centered around his capital in al-Bahrein when the Fatimid Caliphate rose in the west. After his father's demise, Abu Tahir continued as the new leader and became infamous throughout the Arabian Peninsula for his raids into Egyptian and Abbasid lands. In 930 he pillaged Mecca, murdered the many pilgrims who had travelled there and stole the Black Stone. After this sacrilege the Qarmatians became even more hated throughout the whole Muslim world, but that did not deter Abu Tahir as he continued the raids and assaults on his neighbours, until he finally died a decade later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_454500;Edward III was in many ways a warrior king, who was crowned after the disastrous reign of his father came to an end in 1327. Under Edward, England was transformed into one of most formidable military powers in Europe and his claim to the French throne would begin the conflict that eventually became known as the Hundred Years War. During his long reign, which would go on to last fifty years, Edward focused mostly on military matters. He personally oversaw the decisive Battle of Crécy, where an English army consisting mostly of longbowmen defeated a much larger French force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_455500;Philippe the Fortunate was the first French king to hail from the House of Valois, and under his reign France would see the beginning of the Hundred Years War.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_471500;Casimir the Great inherited the throne of Poland in 1333 and continued his fathers work in unifying the Polish kingdom. During his lifetime he went on military campaigns to expand his realm to the east and solidify his borders in the west. To get support from the Hungarian nobles he also promised them the Polish throne if he would end up heirless. Unfortunately he didn't manage to produce a legal male heir, in spite of his four different marriages, and after his death in 1370 the Hungarians pressed their claim to the Polish crown and ended the Piast dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_476500;Son of Osman I, the founder and namesake of the illustrious Ottoman dynasty, Orhan succeeded his father upon his death.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_478011;Hulegu was the grandson of Genghis Khan. When his brother Möngke became Great Khan, Hulegu was ordered to conquer the remaining Muslim territories in western Asia. For his campaign he was assigned the largest Mongol army assembled and with it he ravaged the important Muslim cities of Baghdad and Damascus. This effectively pushed the centre of Muslim power west to the Mamluks in Cairo. He was also responsible for destroying the Hashashins. The lands he conquered became the foundation for the Ilkhanate which became a major power in the Middle East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_480000;Mohammed Özbeg was the longest reigning khan of the Golden Horde, and it was under him that the Mongol splinter state reached the height of its power. Özbeg was converted to Islam at an early age, and upon assuming the throne he adopted it as a state religion. Despite this he was known to be highly tolerant of Christians, something that Pope John XXII would personally thank him for in a letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

OTTO_THE_FIRST_ERA_INFO;On the 7th of August 936, Otto I was crowned King of the Germans. He initiated his arduous campaign to crush his rivals and reconquer the lost territory in Italy to reform the Holy Roman Empire. The Magyars settled down in the Carpathian Basin and began to make their mark on the world as they conquered and pillaged their neighbors, becoming feared across Europe. In the north the Christians were trying to push into the Scandinavian Peninsula to start converting the pagan kings, but the Germanic faith still stood strong among the vikings. In Baghdad far to the south-east, the ancient Abbasid Caliphate that once ruled an empire stretching from Persia to Hispania finally fell to infighting, left only with the heartland of their former empire. And on the shores of Africa a new rival rose up in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate, ready to fill the vacant regions left behind by their adversary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIKING_ERA;Viking Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIKING_ERA_INFO;By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
