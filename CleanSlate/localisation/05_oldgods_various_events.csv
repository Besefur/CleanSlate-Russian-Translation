EVTDESC_TOG_3000;As the enemy draws near during the battle, an uncontrollable rage begins to swell within you. You furiously bite down on the edges of your shield in an attempt to devour it. Trembling with anger, you then raise your great axe and charge howling into the enemy ranks. Many of the cowards attempt to flee at the mere sight of you, but your axe has no mercy to spare for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3001;Consumed by bloodlust and shaking with berserker rage, you cleave the skull of yet another foe with your axe. That was a worthy opponent, and only when you turn to seek more fodder for your axe do you notice the large spear impaling your thigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3002;Consumed by bloodlust and shaking with berserker rage, you cleave the skull of yet another foe with your axe. That was a worthy opponent, and only when you turn to seek more fodder for your axe do you notice the long arrow impaling your thigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3003;Your berserker rage has left you isolated and surrounded, and as you swing your axe at the nearest foe, an arrow burrows into your shoulder and two more dig into your chest. Throwing your shield aside, you wield your axe two-handed and cleave yet another skull before falling to your knees. Moments later a dozen enemies hurl themselves at you like a pack of rabid dogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3004;Your vision turns red with bloodlust and you charge ahead without regard for your safety. As your nearest companions hurry to keep up, you surrender to your berserker rage and your axe cuts a wide swath in the enemy ranks. When the dust settles, they find you standing over half a dozen slain foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3005;Despite your best efforts, you have thus far been cheated of a glorious death in battle. Sadly, you no longer have the endurance or constitution necessary to sustain your berserker rage. Perhaps such things are best left for the youth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3006;You are in the middle of a heated discussion with [berserker_target.GetTitledFirstName], your bothersome courtier, when you feel the berserker rage rising within you. As [berserker_target.GetFirstName] continues to babble about trivial concerns, you bite down hard on the wooden table and begin to froth at the mouth. Soon your vision turns red as the familiar bloodlust is roused from its slumber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3007;As your servants hurry towards your throne room to see what the commotion is about, the doors fly open and [berserker_target.GetTitledFirstName] tumbles out with torn clothes, several missing teeth and a face covered in bruises. He runs away in mad panic as you struggle to calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3008;You bite off a large chunk of table and spit it out as [berserker_target.GetTitledFirstName] continues to drone on. The berserker rage is upon you, but with great effort you manage to channel it towards the table instead of [berserker_target.GetFirstName]. With your axe you reduce the table to firewood, and as you lie panting in the wreckage, [berserker_target.GetFirstName] finally stops his tirade to ask: Are you feeling well, my [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3100;Varangian raiders sailing from the distant north down the rivers leading into the Black Sea have proven themselves to be formidable warriors. You have managed to recruit a great many of their number into a personal guard loyal only to the [Root.GetTitle].\n\nThis new Varangian Guard will not only form a powerful shock force against the Empire's many enemies, but their foreign roots should also preclude them from becoming too entangled in the palace intrigue and power struggles that are so commonplace in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3101_A;[From.GetFirstName], the great [From.GetKingQueen] of the Greeks, is distraught over the poor mettle of [From.GetHerHis] countrymen. Knowing well our skill in battle, [From.GetSheHe] has decided to form a bodyguard consisting solely of Norse warriors.\n\nThose who serve [From.GetHerHim] in the great city of Miklagård are generously rewarded, and even now many of our young men, eager for riches and adventure, have departed for Greece to pick up [From.GetHerHis] banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3110;My [my_child.GetSonDaughter], [my_child.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to enlist with the Varangian Guard in Miklagård and seek [my_child.GetHerHis] fortune there! Although [my_child.GetSheHe] will no doubt gain both riches and valuable battle experience in service of the Greek [greek_king_or_queen.GetKingQueen], there will be many perils that could well cost [my_child.GetHerHim] [my_child.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3112;A grizzled old warrior having just returned from Greece arrived with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] today. Though [From.GetSheHe] has left the Varangian Guard, my [From.GetSonDaughter] has apparently found [From.GetHerselfHimself] a Greek [From.GetHusbandWifeOpp] and decided to remain in Miklagård and build a new life there. "It is doubtful we will ever see [From.GetHerHim] again, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3113;After finishing [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has married a local [From.GetManWomanOpp] and decided to remain in Constantinople instead of returning home to the barbaric frozen wasteland [From.GetSheHe] once came from. [From.GetSheHeCap] has pledged [From.GetHerHis] continued service to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3115;A heavily scarred warrior clad in strange armor approaches my throne, and before [From.GetSheHe] can be disarmed, the stranger relieves my guard of their spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but I raise my hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from Greece!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3117;My [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has finally returned home from Greece and [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard! Although I can't quite put my finger on it, [From.GetSheHe] seems different somehow... and what is this Greek love he speaks of?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3119;A frail, robed [From.GetManWoman] is led into my throne room, and the guards explain that [From.GetSheHe] just arrived on a ship coming from Miklagård. The [From.GetManWoman] would only speak my name over and over again, and so [From.GetSheHe] was brought to me. To my horror, I recognize [From.GetHerHim] at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3121;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful career in the Varangian Guard! [From.GetSheHeCap] fought in several battles, and learned much from the clever strategies and tactics favored by both the Greeks and their enemies in Serkland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Greece and the Varangian Guard, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to speak of [From.GetHerHis] experiences there. I know [From.GetSheHe] took part in several battles and killed many foes, but instead of reveling in the glory of [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3125;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from Miklagård and [From.GetHerHis] service with the Varangian Guard, but [From.GetSheHe] is not alone. [From.GetSheHeCap] has found a Greek [From.GetHusbandWifeOpp] and brought [From.GetHerHimOpp] with [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCapOpp] is not familiar with our customs or language, and the climate does not seem to agree with [From.GetHerHimOpp], but [From.GetSheHeOpp] seems willing to make the best of [From.GetHerHisOpp] new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3127;After many years in Greece, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from [From.GetHerHis] service to the Varangian Guard and returned home. My son is a changed [From.GetManWoman], however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and [From.GetSheHe] instead speaks incessantly of Christendom and the horrors that await those who refuse to convert...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3129;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Miklagård and the Varangian Guard a changed [From.GetManWoman]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is wiser, more confident in [From.GetHerHis] own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Greece did [From.GetHerHim] good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3131;Several former Varangian Guardsmen have recently returned home after serving the Greek [greek_king_or_queen.GetKingQueen], and they bring news most grave. My [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has fallen in battle while campaigning in Serkland. They assure me that [From.GetSheHe] faced [From.GetHerHis] enemy with bravery and slew many, before their numbers overwhelmed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3133;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Greece on a longship filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the great [greek_king_or_queen.GetKingQueen] of the Greeks is generous to those who serve [greek_king_or_queen.GetHerHim] well, and there is gold here from all over the Greek realm, Serkland and beyond. My [From.GetSonDaughter] insists on sharing these riches with me, [From.GetHerHis] loving [Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3134;The death of my [From.GetRootRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has urged me to depart Miklagård and leave the Varangian guard. I am returning home on a longship, filled with loot from our campaigns in Serkland. After a long and perilous journey back, my feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is my birthright. The throne is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3200;A woman claiming to be a völva, a seeress, has been brought before you and she asks to join your court. If her sejdr sorcery is as strong as she claims and she can truly glimpse into the future, her services could prove invaluable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3201;There are rumors of a young woman from an isolated farm in [Root.Capital.GetName] who has been gifted with the mysterious powers of sejdr. The sorcery she wields grants her the power to see into the future and to curse or bless those she lays her eyes on. Will you ask her to join your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3202;A faint whisper draws your attention and you find a haggard old crone in a dark corner of your longhouse. Before you have a chance to throw her out, she explains that she is a völva – a seeress. She claims to be powerful in the ways of sejdr, and she has come to offer you her services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3205;You are spending some time with [pregnant_spouse.GetFirstName], who is carrying your unborn child, when [warning_volva.GetFirstName], your völva seeress, bursts screaming into your bedchamber. The child is a demon, she wails. I have seen it! You are about to unleash a great evil upon the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3211;It is the dead of night when a sudden chill comes upon you. You open your eyes and sit up only to see [demon_child.GetFirstName] standing at the foot of your bed staring at you in complete silence. After rubbing the sleep out of your eyes, you look again and now there is no sign of the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3213;[demon_child.GetFirstName] is sitting on the floor, playing with [demon_child.GetHerHis] toys when something dark suddenly seems to come over the child. While spasming wildly, [demon_child.GetFirstName] cries out in a tongue foreign to you and [demon_child.GetHerHis] eyes roll back inside [demon_child.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3215;An inhuman wail interrupts your sleep, and you hurry outside with your axe. On the ground in front of the longhouse you find [demon_child.GetFirstName] running around in circles upside down on all fours like a spider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3218;The corpse of [killed_courtier.GetTitledName] was discovered today at the bottom of a steep ravine with a broken neck. It seems to have been a tragic accident ordained by the gods, but strangely, [demon_child.GetFirstName] was seen standing next to the ravine, peering down into it just before the tragedy was revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3221;[killed_courtier.GetTitledName] was found impaled on a wooden fence just outside your longhouse this morning. You can only deduce that [killed_courtier.GetSheHe] fell on the fence from the roof of your longhouse, though what business [killed_courtier.GetSheHe] had up there you cannot fathom. Poor [demon_child.GetFirstName] was the first one to lay eyes on the gruesome scene...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3224;[killed_courtier.GetTitledName] was found stuffed head first into a barrel full of rain water this morning, with only [killed_courtier.GetHerHis] pale, rigid legs visible above the surface. Your guards speculate that [killed_courtier.GetSheHe] tripped, somehow fell into the barrel and then tragically drowned. [demon_child.GetFirstName] was found playing just nearby, but doesn't seem to have seen anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3252;[exorcising_volva.GetTitledName] ambushes you as you leave your longhouse and speaks to you in a pleading voice. [demon_child.GetFirstName] must be purged of the evil [demon_child.GetSheHe] carries within [demon_child.GetHerHim]. There is no other way. I can perform a galdr ritual, but I won't lie - the child may or may not survive the ordeal. Nevertheless, the demon must be vanquished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3253;The galdr ritual to cleanse your spawn of evil has begun. The child is brought to a raised platform in a grove where [exorcising_volva.GetFirstName] awaits surrounded by chanting maidens. You are not permitted to witness the sacred ritual itself, so you depart the grove and wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3256;The incantations from the grove suddenly stop, and several maidens, their white gowns red with someone else's blood, run past screaming. Fearing the worst you hurry back, but when you reach the platform you find only the butchered remains of [exorcising_volva.GetFirstName]... and [demon_child.GetFirstName] standing smiling next to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3257;A solemn procession of maidens led by [exorcising_volva.GetTitledName] finally emerges from the grove, but there is no sign of [demon_child.GetFirstName]. It is done, [exorcising_volva.GetFirstName] announces. The demon is no more... but I fear there was no way to save your child. The corruption simply went too deep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3258;The chanting from the grove comes closer and [exorcising_volva.GetTitledName] appears together with [demon_child.GetFirstName], flanked on either side by singing maidens. The child looks shaken, but otherwise unharmed. It is done, [exorcising_volva.GetFirstName] announces. The demon is no more. [demon_child.GetFirstName] is [demon_child.GetHerselfHimself] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3259;The chanting from the grove comes closer and [exorcising_volva.GetTitledName] appears together with [demon_child.GetFirstName], flanked on either side by singing maidens. The child's vacant stare hints that something is wrong. It is done, [exorcising_volva.GetFirstName] announces. The demon is no more, but the struggle was great. I fear it has left scars on [demon_child.GetFirstName] that may never heal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3300;As your men return from looting the holding, one of them hands you an axe with a strange purple sheen and a plus etched into the handle, followed by the number two. After weighing it carefully in your hands, you toss aside your old, grey axe in favor of the new weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3301;A strange chest made of an unknown metal was recovered by your men while they looted the holding. Try as they might, they haven't been able to force the chest open and its contents remain a mystery. It has now been deposited into your care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3302;While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. As you examine it, the metal reminds you of that mysterious chest you recovered earlier. Perhaps there is a connection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3303;While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. You have only seen such a metal once before – that mysterious chest that has been inherited and passed along in your family. It's still gathering dust somewhere in your chambers... could this be the key that opens it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3306;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. It is filled with ancient gold coins, carved with the likeness of the long-dead Emperors of Rome and words written in their strange language!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3307;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Disappointingly, it contains only a few parched scrolls that crumble into dust at your touch. Whatever wisdom they held has been forever lost to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3308;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Sadly, it is filled with nothing but worthless baubles and various trinkets. There is not a trace of gold to be found here, but the contents of the chest could probably be traded away for a few coins at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3309;The key fits the lock, and you slowly open the chest. It contains nothing but dust! As you run your hand through it, strange lights begin to manifest in the room and you close your eyes when the first ghostly apparitions appear. You hear the screams of your guards, and when you finally open your eyes again, the spectres are gone... and your guards have been reduced to ash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3320;The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome Viking raider. All along the coasts, mothers tucking their children in for the night warn that unless they behave, the terrible [Root.GetFirstName], scourge of the seas, will come ashore with [Root.GetHerHis] undead warriors and eat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3400;Two mysterious hunters came to me recently, telling me that I should lie with [buffalo_woman.GetFirstName], my ugly, deformed wife, for she shall bear me a son who will become a great and mighty king. The wise men and wise women tell me that the hunters have powers of prophecy and magic, and that I should heed their advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3401;Your men have managed to hunt down the bear that has been killing livestock in nearby villages. The men are now calling for a feast in commemoration of the bear's spirit, called peijaiset. Since bears hold great symbolism in our life, it might not be wise to pass this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3402;As you are out hunting one afternoon, a bearded elder approaches, donning a simple traveler's cloak and a wide brimmed hat that conceals his other eye. He greets you with courtesy, requests a horn of mead, and then informs you that just yonder, a well lies forgotten, filled with gold. He wanders off, chuckling as he goes, leaving you struck with the familiarity of his presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_3201;Yes, she is welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3202;So be it. You may stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3205;Guards, remove the witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3211;Was it a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_3303;Let us find out! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3306;A small fortune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3307;Just my luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3308;Better than nothing, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3309;This... this chest needs to be buried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3320;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3400;I shall lie with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3401;Of course! Let's also hope for his good reincarnation as a creature of the forest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3402;You inform your men that the wanderer was none other than Odin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_3300;This aberration of a weapon must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_3400;I refuse to lie with this ugly, buffalo-like woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_3401;Sadly, I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_3402;You ignore your mens' insistence that the stranger was the Allfather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_TOG_3400;The hunters are merely superstitious madmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
