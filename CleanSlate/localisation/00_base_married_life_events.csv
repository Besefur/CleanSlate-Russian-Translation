EVTDESC30000;After months of fights, arguments and tears, my spouse suggested separate bedchambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30001;My new wife disgusts me! I cannot stand it anymore, I should annul our marriage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30002;My spouse ended our marriage on grounds of non-consummation! I will not put up with this, I am [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30003;I asked my [Root.Religion.GetName] father to annul my marriage but he had already been snared by the lies of my former wife! He told me to take her back or else he would place my lands under an interdict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30004;It irks me that my own son will not inherit the title! My husband's heir must be removed, but how?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30005;My son and heir [Root.Heir.GetTitledFirstName]'s sudden illness could be the signs of poisoning! I know my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] well enough to suspect her, her ambition has always been that her son would inherit my title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30006;A courtier snuck up behind me and grabbed my arm. He hissed that he had seen me pour something into the heir's glass of milk only hours before he fell ill and wants some sort of bribe to keep quiet about the poisoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30007;My son died today, poisoned by his own stepmother! I cannot ignore the fact that my beloved [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] was cold-blooded enough to murder my son in favor of her own son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30008;My husband's son is dead! The only cloud on my otherwise blue sky is the courtier who claims he saw me poisoning the heir repeatedly until he died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30009;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] threw me into the dungeon, accusing me of poisoning [Root.GetHerHis] son!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30010;My dear [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] blames my confused head for the poisoning, [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] seem to think I believed the poison was a miracle cure for his son's illness. I will let [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] believe that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30011;After both my son and my courtier had fallen ill with the same symptoms and no one else had been affected, one of the serving girls told me in confidence that she had seen my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] pour a drop of something suspiciously poisonous into the flagon of mulled wine my son and courtier had shared. Did my spouse deliberately poison my son, and, perhaps accidentally, my courtier?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30020;Only one thing can explain my son [Root.Heir.GetFirstName]'s sickness: poison! I talked to several of my courtiers and servants who confirmed my suspicion: they all recalled my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] giving [Root.Heir.GetFirstName] something to eat or drink just before [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] fell ill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30021;My [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30025;I feel that [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is too affectionate towards a [Root.Spouse.GetManWoman] in the court and is starting to neglect me in favor of that [Root.Spouse.GetManWoman]! The love [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] showers [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] favorite with is beyond measure, I do hope they don't have a illicit and sinful union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30026;The whispers in court about me having favorites and 'showering them in a love that is beyond measure' and that I am having a 'illicit and sinful union' with a [Root.GetManWoman] at the court has grown in strength, with my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] as one of the gossipers! I need to stop these rumors before they reach the ears of my religious leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30027;It had not escaped [From.GetFirstName] that I have favorites among the people of the court, but the things [From.GetSheHe] accused me of took my breath away. I, having an 'illicit and sinful union' with a [Root.GetManWoman]? [From.GetFirstName] demands that I shower [From.GetHerHim] with the same love and attention I allegedly show my favorites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30028;When I had finished talking, [From.GetFirstName] looked at me for a long time. I grew more nervous with each passing minute, wishing I hadn't used the words 'illicit and sinful union' about [From.GetHerHis] relation with that [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30029;The humiliation still burns through my body! I never meant for the gossip to reach [From.GetFirstName]'s ears, I only needed to talk to someone about my loneliness and my fear of [From.GetFirstName] having a love affair with a [From.GetManWoman], but the harsh words and the loathing in [From.GetHerHis] eyes made me wish I never uttered a word about my suspicions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30030;The thoughts of how I'll never be reunited with my family keeps tormenting me, how someone of my stature could possibly be locked up in a horrid place such as this is beyond me. In the depths of my despair the news reach me, my [outside_spouse.GetFirstName] is trying to have me released!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30031;My prisoner [prisoner_spouse.GetTitledFirstName]'s spouse  [outside_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a letter insisting I would meet [outside_spouse.GetHerHim] in [outside_spouse.GetHerHis] keep. [outside_spouse.GetSheHeCap] asked me to show mercy and release [outside_spouse.GetHerHis] spouse for a hefty sum of money [outside_spouse.GetSheHe] obviously does not have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30032;After my encouraging letter to [prisoner_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] [prisoner_spouse.GetSheHe] managed to send me a letter in return begging me to try and release [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHim] as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30033;I'm in the study doing research when the news reach me. [prisoner_spouse.GetSheHeCap]'s dead. [prisoner_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] died in prison before I was able to have [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHim] released.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30034;I was released from the dungeons of [prisoner_host.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30035;I was yet again thrown into the dungeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30036;Dear [outside_spouse.GetTitledFirstName], I strongly suggest you give up on the idea you might be able to rescue [prisoner_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] from [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHis] imprisonment and I will not be easily persuaded to release [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHim]. You may never see [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHim] if you do not stop your ridiculous attempts of freeing [prisoner_spouse.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n[prisoner_host.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30037;Despite my letter warning [outside_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] to give up [outside_spouse.GetHerHis] attempts to rescue [outside_spouse.GetHerHis] spouse, a letter arrived this morning telling me to release the [prisoner_spouse.GetManWoman] or else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30040;My husband [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has hired an incredibly annoying [annoying_courtier.GetManWoman] to serve us. [annoying_courtier.GetHerHisCap] rudeness knows no limits, and I have no idea how to handle [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim]. [annoying_courtier.GetSheHeCap] does not know [annoying_courtier.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30041;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has asked me to get rid of one of my courtiers whom she finds mighty annoying. On one hand, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] might not be happy if I refuse her request, but if I fire 'the annoying [annoying_courtier.GetManWoman]' maybe people will feel my wife has too much influence over my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30042;Apparently, one of the courtiers has been annoying my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], and instead of asking me for help she took the matter in her own hands and made sure the courtier would never annoy her again or [annoying_courtier.GetSheHe] would know the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30045;While walking alongside the river together with several people from the court, one of the courtiers keeps annoying me, so I decide to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30046;The young [annoying_courtier.GetManWoman] I pushed into the river ended up drowning. Although it was an accident rumors of my deed spread quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30047;Wet, but otherwise unharmed, the courtier blasted me with foul words and angry but empty threats. Seeing [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim] standing before me dripping mud and with algae entwined into [annoying_courtier.GetHerHis] hair, I could not stop the laughter pouring out of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30050;My wife [my_spouse.GetFirstName] has complained about me being absent so often, and so when I found that I had some extra gold to spend, I decided to buy her something nice. Maybe some sort of jewellery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30051;When my [my_spouse.GetHusbandWife]'s mare had to be put down, I promised [my_spouse.GetFirstName] that I would find a new suitable ride for [my_spouse.GetHerHim]. Now I am in luck! Not only one, but three different mares have been brought to [Root.Location.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30052;My [my_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [my_spouse.GetFirstName] explains that [my_spouse.GetSheHe] is captivated by the grace and strength of hunting birds, and begs me for a bird.\n"Surely, even the spouse of the [Root.GetTitle] must be allowed to enjoy the noble pastime of falconry", [my_spouse.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30052_B;My [my_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [my_spouse.GetFirstName] explains that [my_spouse.GetSheHe] is captivated by the grace and strength of hunting birds, and begs me for a bird.\n"They are just so cute, with their little wings and their... Are they called beaks?", [my_spouse.GetSheHe] asks, gesturing at my nose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30055;The stubborn baron of [Root.Location.GetName] is really getting on my nerves! My wife, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], sensed my irritation and offered to give me advice on the matter. Her diplomatic skill has saved me many times before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30056;Two competent contenders are fighting for a position in [Root.Location.GetName] training the levies there. My gut tells me to choose the younger man who has risen through the ranks fast, whilst my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is urging me to choose the older man who has never risen above the rank of sergeant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30057;Gold pours from my hands but never finds its way back! The numbers and sums make no sense, twirling numbers mocking me appear every time I close my eyes. My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has offered to help me, but I have refused every time she brings it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30058;I have my eyes set on a title, but my Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFullName] has advised me to forget about the title, saying I would invoke too much wrath if I try to claim it. My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], however, is doing everything but telling me outright that I should pursue the title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30059;The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s are not always easy to deal with. I need to make sure I have their approval and I have both my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] giving me advice on how to earn the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s' approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30061;My sweet [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is terrifying when she wants something, there is nothing she wouldn't do to make me bend to her will. Now she wants me to make one of her friends [Root.GetMyChancellorName], but [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName] is a very competent man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30064;No matter how many times I try to point out the virtues of Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetFullName], my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] won't listen. She cannot take no for an answer, not when she has decided that her friend should be Marshal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30067;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is adamant, she tries to make me appoint one of her male friends, who might mean more to her than I earlier suspected, Steward. No matter how well our current Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetFullName] does his job I need to decide whether I should make [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] happy by or if the current Steward will get to keep his job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30070;I cannot get any rest from [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] pestering me about making her good friend Spymaster. She does not care that our Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFullName] is competent, skilled and a great Spymaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30073;I have noticed [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s affection for one of the courtiers and heard her praise his [Player.Religion.GetPietyName], so it did not surprise me when she approached me and tried to convince me to appoint him as [Root.GetLordSpiritualName]. Trouble is, [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] is well respected and many would disapprove if I were to fulfill [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30075;My husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and I long for children, but despite our best efforts and the time we spend together in the bedchamber I have failed to conceive. The suspicion of being barren makes me seek consolation in another man's arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30076;The pregnancy is starting to show and my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s happiness shows no bounds. I should be happy as well, but in my heart I know my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] isn't the father of my child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30077;My happiness when my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] told me I was about to be a father made me almost blind to her feelings, she smiled and seemed happy but something was amiss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30078;The bigger her belly gets, the thinner and more heavy-hearted my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] seems. Her appearance made me worry and I finally asked her what was wrong. It was as if [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] had just waited to tell me about her indiscretion with the courtier and her belief that it is the courtier who is the father of the child she carries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30079;The look on my pregnant wife's face whenever she sees one of the male courtiers has made me suspicious. It is a weird mixture of guilt, gratefulness and a warning of some sorts. I confronted my wife and, after awhile, she confessed to having had an affair with the courtier but blamed him for seducing her and impregnating her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30080;I need to set an example with the courtier who impregnated my wife. I could throw him into prison, execute him or banish him, making sure no one will ever dare touch my wife again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30081;The child my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] carry is not mine. The pain of her betrayal is still fresh in my mind, I will punish her in the same way I will punish the courtier who impregnated her and made her an adulteress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30085;My lovely young wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has expressed her boredom several times, in several ingenious ways. The court is boring, hunting is boring, embroidery is boring, her ladies-in-waiting are boring and she wants me to 'make the boredom go away'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30086;My boring old husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] told me his obligations is more important than my well-being! He might be right though, I should probably try to find a friend among the courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30088;[target_courtier.GetBestName] and I agreed to do something together the next morning, so I am currently planning what we should do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30089;Despite the threatening clouds in the sky we started walking to the lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30090;The cook had packed a perfect picnic, with some roast lamb, bread, cheese and wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30091;The dogs were excited, the horses willing and the day had barely begun. My friend and I set out to hunt some serious game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30092;I was just making the last arrangements to the dinner table when my guest arrived. We would not go starving from this table!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30095;[From.GetBestName] has avoided me for some time now, probably because we do not have anything in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30096;We fit together, [From.GetBestName] and I. No matter what we do together, we always have a good time and we can talk for hours without getting bored with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30100;The attraction between me and my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has slowly started to fade. I realized this had been happening for some time when we week after week used the bedchamber to sleep in instead of having all the fun we used to have there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30101;The passion between [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and myself was still there, only slumbering beneath our skins, and easily reawakened by a lover's touch. It was hot, fierce, wonderful lovemaking such as we used to have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30102;Sweetly, gently we molded our bodies together and re-created the familiar feel of us embracing, touching, loving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30103;The wild ride which showed [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] who was the boss in the bedchamber killed him. He died with a smile on his lips, so maybe this was the perfect way of leaving this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30104;I wanted to show [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] the passion between us had never died out, but even the sweetest, gentlest lovemaking was too passionate for his heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30105;I suspect that my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is unable to sire children. If my husband is infertile, then maybe I need to find someone who is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA30000;Separate bedchambers? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30001;I don't ever want to see you again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30002;O holy father, help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30003;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30004;By poison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30005;Imprison her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30006;No one will believe him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30007;Remove her from my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30009;This is not how it should end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30010;I knew I would get away with it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30011;Then she will spend the rest of her life imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30020;May she rot in the Dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30021;To the dungeon with [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30025;Mayhap I read too much into this, surely [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] loves me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30026;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], what have you done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30027;I will show you that no one matters as much to me as you do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30028;[From.GetFirstName] promised to pay me more attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30029;I don't know if [From.GetHerHim] will ever forgive me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30030;I do anything I can to make [outside_spouse.GetHerHis] work easier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30031;This is not negotiable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30032;I don't think I dare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30033;I'll never be able to stop blaming myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30034;I'm so happy I could cry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30035;What a failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30036;But... Fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30037;I have tired of this. Here, have your [prisoner_spouse.GetManWoman] back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30040;I'll do my best to ignore [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim] and trust my husbands decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30041;My [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s happiness is more important to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30042;What on earth was she thinking?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30045;... jokingly push [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim] into the river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30046;I'll send gifts to his family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30047;I'm s-s-sorry... Hahahaha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30050;This bracelet would really bring out the... color in her eyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30051;The skewbald one looks a bit old, but sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30052;Will a buzzard do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30055;... I hope she can save me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30056;I trust my wife more than my gut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30057;I give up! Honey, please help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30058;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is right, I should pursue the title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30059;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] suggests I should offer to rebuild the [Root.Religion.GetHouseOfWorship];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30061;I will let her have her way just this once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30064;Enough! Fine, your 'special' friend will be Marshal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30065;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] accepted my friend as Marshal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30067;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s happiness is important to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30070;Stop pestering me and I'll make your friend Spymaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30073;I will make [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s friend [Root.GetLordSpiritualName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30075;The consolation came with a price - I'm pregnant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30076;My husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will never know the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30077;Maybe it's nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30078;This child is ours, no matter who fathered it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30080;Imprison the adulterer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30081;Imprison the adulterer and the adulteress!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30085;Fine, I'll humor you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30086;Please be my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30088;A trip to the lake is always nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30089;But the skies opened up and drenched us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30090;Ants ate our picnic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30091;There were plenty of game in the forest, and now a lot less;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30092;Dinner was pleasant and with great company!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30095;I think I'll find someone else to befriend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30096;I think I have found a new friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30100;I want to take [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] on a 'wild ride';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30101;It was... exhilarating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30102;Love, how I have missed thee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30103;I hope [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is in Heaven now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30104;May he be happy in Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30105;I do have someone in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB30000;Let us rekindle our love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30001;No, wait! I changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30003;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30004;This is below me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30005;Off with her head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30006;Whatever it is he wants, he'll get it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30007;A life for a life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30011;I will not show her any mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30020;May she rot in Hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30021;I have no mercy for poisoners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30025;I need to talk to someone, see if someone else has noticed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30027;Who I decide to shower with attention is none of your business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30028;[From.GetFirstName] refused to even consider paying me more attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30030;I try to get in contact with [outside_spouse.GetHerHim], ordering [outside_spouse.GetHerHim] to speed things up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30031;Fine! But I want the gold to be delivered immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30032;I will send a firm but respectful letter to [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHis] captor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30033;Stupid [prisoner_spouse.GetManWoman]! Here I am trying to save [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHim], how dare [prisoner_spouse.GetSheHe] die on me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30036;Just empty threats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30037;Guards! Make sure the prisoner won't escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30040;If possible I'll have [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim] fired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30041;She should stay out of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30042;She did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30045;... order [annoying_courtier.GetHerHim] to be quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30046;I shall tell the public what happened;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30050;A cameo of myself perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30051;The white mare is a bit frisky, but she'll be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30052;A falcon would serve you well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30055;I can work this out myself, thank you very much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30056;This is no business for a woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30057;I can tame those numbers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30058;I would invoke people's wrath if I follow my wife's advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30059;[Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] suggests I try to scare them into submission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30061;Her 'friend' is not good enough to become [Root.GetMyChancellorName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30064;No matter what you say I will not make your friend Marshal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30067;I will keep [Root.job_treasurer.GetFullName] as my Steward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30070;Nothing you say or do will make me change my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30073;[Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] will keep his job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30076;I should tell my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30078;The child is ours, but the courtier must be punished;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30080;Execute the adulterer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30081;Execute the adulterer and the adulteress!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30085;Honey, I have obligations I must take care of;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30088;Let's have a picnic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30089;The clouds departed and the sun shone down on us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30090;The food was nice but the company better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30091;We became the game, a family of bears hunted us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30092;Dinner was quiet, we had nothing to say to each other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30100;I will be gentle to him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30101;It was a wild ride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30102;Gently, we woke the passion between us once again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30105;I will not have an affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC30000;Whatever you say, honey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30005;I will forgive her this little mishap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30006;I still have some poison left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30007;Surely she didn't understand what she did?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30011;She clearly did not know what she was doing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30020;May she one day realize what she has done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30021;[Root.Spouse.GetSheHeCap] would never do such a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30025;I should confront my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30030;Who cares? It's not like [outside_spouse.GetSheHe]'ll succeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30031;Your insolence bores me. Into the dungeon with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30033;I blame [prisoner_spouse.GetHerHis] family for this! They did nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30037;I did warn [outside_spouse.GetHerHim], didn't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30040;I have the [annoying_courtier.GetManWoman] punished for [annoying_courtier.GetHerHis] insolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30045;... ignore [annoying_courtier.GetHerHis] annoying comments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30046;I never meant for this to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30050;Ruby earrings are exactly what she wants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30051;The black one is magnificent, the only suitable match for my [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30052;Too dangerous, my love. I don't want you to overexert yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30076;If my husband suspects anything, I will blame the courtier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30078;How could you do this to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30080;Banish the adulterer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30081;Banish the adulterer and the adulteress!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30088;Hunting is always fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30089;I did not like the company;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30100;We will make sweet, sweet love...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30101;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] woke my lust for her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD30031;No more letters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30046;Anyone speaking of the event will be punished;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30050;I think I'll just keep the gold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30051;I'm sorry, honey, but all these will be breeders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30080;The taste of vengeance is foul, I will do nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30081;I have changed my mind, I will only punish the courtier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD30088;A quiet dinner together would be perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# CleanSlate: No longer used
# EVTDESC30110;The imams are not always easy to deal with. I need to make sure I have their approval and I have both my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] giving me advice on how to earn the imam's approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30110;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] suggests I should offer to rebuild the mosque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB30110;[Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] suggests I try to scare the imams into submission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVTDESC30060;[Root.Spouse.job_chancellor.GetFullName] is doing a somewhat good job as a [Root.GetMyChancellorName] but there is a contender for the title, one of my special male friends. I am slowly but stubbornly trying to make [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] realize the potential of my friend, and now I am prepared to use the final and best argument to make him do as I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30062;When I presented my ultimatum to my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], trying to make him choose my friend to be the new [Root.GetMyChancellorName], he reacted as I had anticipated. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] tried to argue with me, plead with me and even tried to scare me into submission, but I saw in his eyes that he had already made his decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30063;I have a very special male friend who would be an excellent Marshal! Too bad my husband thinks highly of Marshal [Root.Spouse.job_marshal.GetFullName], making it hard for me to convince him of my friend's superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30065;My husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and I argued about who should be Marshal, my special friend or the current one. As I made my arguments, threatened to shun [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] from my bed and stressed my friend superiority over [Root.Spouse.job_marshal.GetFullName], my husband finally took a decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30066;I have tried to make my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] discharge his Steward [Root.Spouse.job_treasurer.GetFullName] in favour of my close friend whom I cannot deny anything. The stubbornness of my husband is convincing me I need to do something drastic in order for him to listen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30068;I am getting tired of fighting for my friend, though I still feel he would make a better Steward than [Root.job_treasurer.GetFullName]. One last effort and whatever my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] decides, I have to accept that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30069;I couldn't care less if our current Spymaster [Root.Spouse.job_spymaster.GetFullName] is competent as a Spymaster or not, my very good friend would truly overtrumph [Root.Spouse.job_spymaster.GetHerHim] as Spymaster! I only have to convince my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] to discharge [Root.Spouse.job_spymaster.GetFullName] and then appoint my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30071;My husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] asked me to give him a couple of days to think about this, he promised me a decision if only I stopped pestering him. I could hardly restrain myself and waited impatiently until my husband declared that he had made a decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30072;The friendship between me and a male courtier is very special, but I fear I might lose him if I cannot find a way to make my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] get rid of the old [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.Spouse.job_spiritual.GetFullName] and appoint my friend as [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] in his stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC30074;I know [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.Spouse.job_spiritual.GetFullName] is well respected, many would disapprove and reproach my husband [Root.Spouse.GetFullName] if he chooses to appoint my friend as the [Root.GetLordSpiritualName], but I don't care. I need a friend at court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVTOPTA30060;Do as I want or else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30062;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] agreed to make my friend [Root.GetMyChancellorName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30063;I will keep arguing until [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] agrees with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30066;It's now or never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30068;My friend has been appointed Steward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30069;That should be easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30071;He will make my friend Spymaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30072;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] must listen to me, if only this once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA30074;Joyous news! My friend is [Root.GetLordSpiritualName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVTOPTB30062;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] refused to make my friend Chancellor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB30065;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] told me he would never make my friend Marshal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB30068;My husband decided to keep the current Steward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB30071;He decided to keep the old Spymaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB30074;I have to respect [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVTTOOLTIP30061;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] gets the ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP30064;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] makes a decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP30067;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is forced to make a decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP30070;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is pestered into making a decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP30073;The future of [Root.GetFirstName]'s friend lies on [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
