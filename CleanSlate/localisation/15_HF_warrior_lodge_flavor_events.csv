HFP_500_DESC;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick], a [combatant_1.GetSocietyRank] in my lodge, is [combatant_1.GetNegativeDuelSkillTerm] duelist at best. It is shameful for someone like [combatant_1.GetHerHim] to be so woefully unready should [Root.Society.GetName] call upon [combatant_1.GetHerHis] aid! Perhaps I should encourage [combatant_1.GetHerHim] to spar with another member?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_501_DESC;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] managed to best [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] handily after a short clash. A cheering crowd heaved [combatant_1.GetFirstName] up on their shoulders after the victory, hoisting [combatant_1.GetHerHim] over to the lodge to celebrate. [combatant_1.GetSheHeCap] will become a renowned warrior yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_502_DESC;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] was soundly beaten down by [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick], who barely broke a sweat. [combatant_1.GetHowWoundedDidIBecome];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_503_DESC;Just as [combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] was about to issue [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] a challenge, [combatant_2.GetFirstName] ran away! I wonder what kind of attitudes we really foster here in [Root.Society.GetName], because this is embarrasing for all of us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_504_DESC;Just as [combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] was about to issue [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] a challenge, [combatant_1.GetSheHe] ran away! What a coward, I have never seen anyone as craven before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_505_DESC;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] and [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] fought each other with teeth and claw! A cheering crowd formed around the combatants, and [combatant_1.GetFirstName] eventually won their favor. [combatant_1.GetHowWoundedDidIBecome];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_506_DESC;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] and [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] fought each other with teeth and claw! A crowd formed around the combatants, jeering at [combatant_1.GetFirstName]'s clumsy moves until [combatant_1.GetSheHe] eventually lost. [combatant_1.GetHowWoundedDidIBecome];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HF_561_DESC;A fellow member of [Root.Society.GetName], §Y[lodge_member_killed.GetFirstNameWithNick]§!, has been killed in a duel by §Y[lodge_member_killer.GetFirstNameWithNick]§!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_14001_ambition;Upon returning from a small raid with my personal guard, I have been talking to [student.GetBestName]. The [student.GetManWoman] does not understand the urge for adventure, whatsoever. "What about the prosperity it brings your tribe?", I argue, showing off a new bracelet decorating my arm. [student.GetSheHeCap] sighs, seemingly unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_bravery;I have seen [student.GetBestName] during a couple of gatherings with [Root.Society.GetName], and I cannot help but notice how the [student.GetAgeAdjective] [student.GetManWoman] appears needlessly jumpy. Flinching at jokes, turning down sparring matches... "[student.GetSheHeCap] needs guidance", I find myself muttering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_diligence;Watching [student.GetBestName] in the training grounds is always interesting. There is something about [student.GetHerHis] fighting technique that comes off as half-hearted, and [student.GetHerHis] weapons, as well as armor, seem like they could use a little more caring for... "[student.GetFirstName], could I have a word?", I interrupt the sparring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_patience;Observing yet another game of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and [student.GetTitledFirstName] storming off with a sullen expression on [student.GetHerHis] face, it occurs to me how my [student.GetRootRelation] sorely lacks patience. "It is useful in battle as well", I mumble, scratching my chin, contemplating offering [student.GetHerHim] some guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_ambition;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from a raid in foreign lands. My [teacher.GetRootRelation] is showing off the bounty brought back, when I let out a sigh, causing [teacher.GetHerHim] to pause. "You know, you always seem so content with what you have, [Root.GetFirstName]" [teacher.GetSheHe] says. "I could help you hone your ambition", [teacher.GetSheHe] presses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_bravery;"I hear you are turning down duels", a [teacher.GetManWoman] sounds behind me. Spinning around, I find myself talking to my [teacher.GetRootRelation], [teacher.GetTitledFirstName]. "[Root.Society.GetNameCap] are aware, of course", [teacher.GetSheHe] says. Putting an arm over my shoulder, [teacher.GetSheHe] continues: "I could help you! You just need a little guidance, my good [Root.GetManWoman]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_diligence;[teacher.GetBestName] is watching me in the training grounds. There is something inquisitive about it, and I am not surprised when [teacher.GetSheHe] comes over, asking about the routines I keep, "maintenance-wise, for your weapons and armor". When I fail to come up with a clear answer, [teacher.GetSheHe] continues, unapologetically: "I could teach you how to care for your sword".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_patience;I recently lost a game of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has approached me, wanting to talk about my temper. "Patience is something that comes from within", my [teacher.GetRootRelation] explains. I clench my fist, a gesture not lost on the [teacher.GetManWoman]. "You just need some guidance", [teacher.GetSheHe] finally says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14003;[student.GetTitledFirstName] agreed that [student.GetSheHe] needs my help. In order to make [student.GetHerHim] see things differently, [Root.GetTeachingMomentActivity];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14004_A;[student.GetTitledFirstName] politely declined my offer. The [student.GetManWoman] apparently feels perfectly fine with the current state of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14004_B;[student.GetTitledFirstName] refused my offer, muttering something about not being a charity project. If adequacy is enough for the [student.GetManWoman], who am I to intervene?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14005;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my response and has sworn to never aid me in any way, ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_ambition;When [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] said we were going to spend several days in a library, my heart sank. "The scribes know details about all the famous warriors" [teacher.GetSheHe] beamed. Thankfully, it only takes a few hours before I find myself enthralled by the stories. "I knew you had it in you", [teacher.GetSheHe] says cheerfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_bravery;When [teacher.GetBestName] informed me that we were going to live in the woods for a few nights, I was tempted to refuse. We could be eaten by snakes! By [Root.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]s! Or attacked by raiders! However, falling asleep in the wilderness, to the wind and rustling of the trees, my fears began to wane. Now, I do not know what it was that I was so afraid of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_diligence;When my [teacher.GetRootRelation] suggested we spend a few afternoons reorganizing [teacher.GetHerHis] armory, I expected to be bored within moments. Yet [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to keep my interest for several days, and I find myself asking questions I have never even thought of before. I am almost embarrassed by my former attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_patience;I was not excited to watch others play games of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and I think [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] could tell. Yet, the patience with which my [teacher.GetRootRelation] narrated the matches to me, explaining each subtle move, was eye-opening. Even seeing fighters who lost one day, return for revenge the next, was inspiring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_ambition;"You want us to spend time, voluntarily, in the library?" [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] nods. "Yes! I think you'll enjoy hearing about old heroes," [teacher.GetSheHe] laughs, [teacher.GetHerHis] eyes aglitter. A few hours later, I understand. The tales are fascinating! "Some make for decent role models", I admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_bravery;I would not have chosen "camping in the woods", but perhaps that is the point. When my [teacher.GetRootRelation] informed me that we were going to live in the wilderness for a few nights, I pushed all imagery of falling off cliffs and being eaten by snakes aside. Looking back on the experience, I have to admit, I am sad it is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_diligence;"Surely, your armory must already be in order?" I offer, but [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] shakes [teacher.GetHerHis] head. "This is more about mastering the principles behind the organizing, than the organizing itself" the [teacher.GetManWoman] explains. A few days later, I admit, I have learned some valuable techniques and practices...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_patience;"We are going to watch *others* play at [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType]?" [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed my reluctance, and gestured me to a seat. Soon, [teacher.GetSheHe] was narrating the games to me, pointing out subtleties and things I would usually miss. "I.. am beginning to understand how a hot temper might get in the way of these things..." I admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_ambition;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent several days couped up in a dusty old library. Apparently it was supposed to "inspire" me, whatever that means. I am sorry to say it had the opposite effect. "Perhaps we are not that alike, after all", the [teacher.GetManWoman] sighs in disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_bravery;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] had us go into the woods, where we were supposed to spend several nights. "Living off the land!" [teacher.GetSheHe] said. "I am the [Root.GetTitle]! I live comfortably in my [Root.GetCapitalHolding], thank you", I responded. The next couple of days were a frightening drudge of unsettling rustling in the trees, cold, and food poisoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_diligence;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] put me to cleaning [teacher.GetHerHis] armory. And everything I did was wrong...! The [teacher.GetManWoman] kept giving me counter-effective instructions and muttering under [teacher.GetHerHis] breath about "impossible", and "why do I even try". If there was a lesson in this, I do not think I understood it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_patience;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] forced me to sit and watch all our friends playing games of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType]. And throughout the whole experience, the [teacher.GetManWoman] talked, and talked, trying to explain the game to me. Eventually I had enough and walked out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14009_ambition;My [student.GetRootRelation] and I are back from our final session with the scribes. [teacher.GetTeachingMomentResult];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14009_bravery;My [student.GetRootRelation] and I are back from our camping trip. [teacher.GetTeachingMomentResult];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14009_diligence;My [student.GetRootRelation] and I are finally done organizing my armory. [teacher.GetTeachingMomentResult];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14009_patience;My [student.GetRootRelation] and I have retired from watching the games. [teacher.GetTeachingMomentResult];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51001;The sudden death of [From.GetBestName] has left an undeniable sense of emptiness. [From.GetHerHisCap] prowess and strength in the battlefield were legendary. Although [From.GetSheHe] is sorely missed, I am sure that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is celebrated as a true warrior in the afterlife as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51002;My search for a worthy weaponsmith has reached the ears of [weapon_forger.GetBestName], who tells me of a ritual that can infuse the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] into a weapon. [weapon_forger.GetSheHeCap] claims that this ritual requires the weapon to be forged in the remains of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] or the body of a close relative. My choice is between desecrating the remains of the dead or to add another one to their ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51003;Under the cover of darkness, I deploy my plan to [GetDecidedActionInHF51002] to forge a soulbound weapon. Although the plan was hastily crafted, I had not expected if to fail so dramatically. [witness1.GetTitledFirstName] is staring at me with such intensity one's skin could burn, and [witness1.GetSheHe] is not alone in witnessing my crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51004;I succeeded in my plan to [GetDecidedActionInHF51002] to forge a soulbound weapon. Memories of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] flood my mind, soon their strength will be wieldable in the shape of a weapon. My efforts are finally bearing fruit, and [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName] requests an answer on what kind of weapon I want forged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51005;The day has finally come, the [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now complete. [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName] suggests you test the weapon, but just a few swings in the air was all it took for the [GetDecidedWeapon] to shatter! [weapon_forger.GetFirstName] struggles for words and then mutters that it is a bad omen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51006;The day has finally come, the [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now complete. [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName] said [weapon_forger.GetSheHe] would bring the weapon to me first thing in the morning, but never showed. The intrusive thought of [weapon_forger.GetHerHim] stealing my [GetDecidedWeapon] enters my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51007;The day has finally come, the [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now complete. As I arrive at the decided location of meeting with [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName], I hear [weapon_forger.GetHerHim] screaming bloody murder. [unfortunate_child.GetTitledFirstName] had somehow gotten a hold of the weapon and injured [unfortunate_child.GetHerselfHimself]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51008;Many good omens have shown the last couple of days, and the completed [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now in my hands. Though the weapon seems ordinary to me, [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName] adamantly says that the ritual was a success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51009;Many good omens have shown the last couple of days, and the completed [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now in my hands. A sudden gust of wind passes by as I touch the weapon and the voice of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] starts ringing in my ear. Though brief, it was as if [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] was standing next to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_51010;Many good omens have shown the last couple of days, and the completed [GetDecidedWeapon] infused with the strength of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is now in my hands. A surge of energy fills me as I touch the weapon. I hear the laughter of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] in my mind as vividly as if [dead_warrior.GetSheHe] were standing in front of me. As [dead_warrior.GetHerHis] laughter dies, I feel stronger than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_500;[combatant_1.GetSheHeCap] needs confidence - [society_practice_duelist_target_1.GetFirstName] should be an easy match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_501;[combatant_1.GetMyOpinionOfYourChoice];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_503;What in the...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_ambition;Oh, I could help you hone that ambition, [student.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_bravery;As a warrior, [student.GetSheHe] needs me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_diligence;Let's talk weapon care and etiquette, my good [student.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_patience;The [student.GetManWoman] needs someone to show [student.GetHerHim] a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_TT;You offer §Y[student.GetTitledFirstName]§! some guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14002;I am open for suggestions. What do you have in mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14002_TT;You accept the guidance of §Y[teacher.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14003;I'll bring my [Root.GetTeachingMomentTool].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14003_TT;You make a show of how invested you are in this endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14004;That ungrateful...! I was going to bring my favorite [Root.GetTeachingMomentTool]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14005;Some people are rather sensitive, are they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14006;Thank you, friend, for this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_ambition;Perhaps I simply never knew of all the things I *could* achieve?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_bravery;There is nothing to fear here, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_diligence;I will strive to be more diligent in the future, [teacher.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14007_patience;I will exercise patience next time, [teacher.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14008;I don't know why I don't learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14009;[student.GetSheHeCap] had this [Root.GetTeachingMomentFocus] in [student.GetHerHim] all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14009_romance;I am happy I could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51001;I shall have a weapon forged in [From.GetHerHis] honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51002;Forgive me, my friend, but I require your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51003;No! It is not what you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51004;An axe is the most appropriate way to honor [dead_warrior.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51005;...It was simply bad luck, nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51006;Find [weapon_forger.GetHerHim] and kill [weapon_forger.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51007;This is a cursed weapon that thirsts for blood! Get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51008;I hope [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] is witnessing this from the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_51009;A part of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] truly is in this weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_500;[society_practice_duelist_target_2.GetFirstName] should provide an even challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14001;This is hardly my responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14001_TT;You have better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14002;I am not your charity project!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14002_TT;You let §Y[teacher.GetTitledFirstName]§! know that you are insulted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14003;Let's not get carried away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14003_TT;You will simply be yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14004;I'll leave [student.GetHerHim] alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14006;I cannot express how grateful I am. Can I... Can I kiss you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14006_TT_romance;§Y[teacher.GetTitledFirstName]§! is as happy as you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14006_TT_student_crushes;§Y[teacher.GetTitledFirstName]§! smiles, and shrugs nonchalantly. "I guess on the cheek would be alright.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14006_TT_teacher_crushes;§Y[teacher.GetTitledFirstName]§! blushes deeply, but nods eagerly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14008;This is *[teacher.GetHerHis]* fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_14009;[student.GetSheHeCap] will hopefully keep working on [student.GetHerHis] [Root.GetTeachingMomentFocus], even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51001;We must teach and reflect on [From.GetHerHis] techniques!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51002;The blood of a family member will have to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51003;It was [weapon_forger.GetTitledFirstName]! [weapon_forger.GetSheHeCap] told me to do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51004;[dead_warrior.GetFirstName] would have wanted a sword in [dead_warrior.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51005;This is clearly your fault! Fix it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51006;[weapon_forger.GetSheHeCap] is simply running late, that is all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51007;The weapon is not what injured the child. The blame is on [unfortunate_child.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51008;Well, if you say so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_51009;No! This is a cursed weapon that thirsts for blood! Get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_500;The best teacher is failure, [society_practice_duelist_target_3.GetFirstName] is the [society_practice_duelist_target_3.GetManWoman] for the job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_14002;You clearly need more hobbies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_14002_TT;You politely decline the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_14009_1;And they think it's *my* fault?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_14009_2;They might need to keep working on this...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_51001;A moment in calm solitude is the best way to pay respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_51002;No, stop this nonsense! Away with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_51004;A mace to crush both my and the old enemies of [dead_warrior.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_51005;I will sacrifice your life to appease the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_51008;I do not appreciate you lying to me, [weapon_forger.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HF_500;No, [combatant_1.GetFirstName] needs to take the initiative [combatant_1.GetHerselfHimself]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTTA_HF_51001;You try to find a smithy of worth to make this weapon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTA_HF_51002;You decide to risk getting caught retrieving [dead_warrior.GetFirstName] remains...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
