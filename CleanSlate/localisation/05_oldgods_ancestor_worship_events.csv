EVTDESC_TOG_7001_wisdom;You asked your Ancestors for guidance and knowledge. Now it is time to present your offering - what will you give them in return?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7002_carving;You placed the delicate little idol on the offering stone and paid your respect to your Ancestors. Now all you can do is wait, and hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7002_feast;Together with the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] and her disciples you placed a great bounty of food and drink on the offering stone. You spent the entire night feasting and singing the great chants in your Ancestors' honor. Now all you can do is wait, and hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7002_human;The offering struggled violently when the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] and her disciples pushed it down on the offering stone. The Ancestors will surely be pleased with such a vigorous servant. Now all you can do is wait, and hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7002_limb;You lay down on the offering stone, bracing yourself for the ritual. Thankfully the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]'s knife is sharp and soon the stone is dark with your blood. Your agonized screams will surely have pleased the ancestor. Now all you can do is wait, and hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7011;I am not sure that athleticism runs in my family, but it never hurts to try a little. However, my subjects have raised some curious eyebrows when they've spotted me lifting barrels and rocks for fun and exercise... I've just felt inspired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7012;I guess it could be the nettle soup I've started eating lately, or the recent good weather, but I feel invigorated. I even got a compliment today, saying I looked several years younger! Is this the work of the Ancestors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7013;Ever since I begged the Ancestors to aid me with my failing health, I have been feeling... off. More off than usual, that is. Perhaps I asked for too much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7014;It is impossible to prove, but I do think I feel slightly better than usual. There is an additional spring in my step and my mind is clearer. I am sure that the Ancestors are with me, keeping me strong and safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7015;No one can explain why, but the affliction which has been tormenting me for these last few weeks seems to have left my body! All of the symptoms are gone and I feel as healthy as ever. By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], it is truly a miracle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7016;I am sick, I know I am. Yet my physician has been struck dumb by how much energy I seem to possess, in the face of the anguish I should be going through. I want to say that I have the Ancestors by my side, but I'm not sure anyone would believe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7020;I don't know why I have never noticed [ancestors_lover.GetTitledFirstName] before. In fact, I have some memory of finding [ancestors_lover.GetHerHim] the opposite of attractive! Yet I find myself drawn to [ancestors_lover.GetHerHis] side. I think perhaps the Ancestors have steered me in [ancestors_lover.GetHerHis] direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7021;There are few things I enjoy more than the company of [ancestors_friend.GetTitledFirstName]. I know we weren't always this close, but it's hard to recall a time when we weren't. In times like these, it's rare to have such a trusted confidant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7022;I've been thinking a lot about my Ancestors lately and I'm reminded by the elusive nature of friendships... I try to be myself, but it's not always that easy to get along with people. However, I want to make an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7023;Did [ancestors_rival.GetTitledFirstName] always bug me like this? Not only does [ancestors_rival.GetSheHe] constantly interrupt my speech, but when we walk past each other [ancestors_rival.GetSheHe] has even stopped greeting me - and I am the [Root.GetTitle]! What have I done to deserve to be treated this way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7024;Recently I have felt as if I have gained a totally new understanding of my people. What drives and inspires them, attracts or repulses them - it all seems so clear now. I do not think I am imagining things, because I have been met with more respect than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7025;Recently this gorgeous black and white cat has been following me around everywhere. It seems as if it has decided that I am its [Root.GetMasterMistress]! I did ask the Ancestors for help with my relationships, although this is not quite what I had in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7030;I have recently noticed one of my soldiers. [ancestors_commander.GetFirstName] is something else, to say the least. [ancestors_commander.GetSheHeCap] outmaneuvers warriors with twice [ancestors_commander.GetHerHis] experience in the sparring ring on a regular basis. Perhaps I can find [ancestors_commander.GetHerHim] a new position?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7032;If my Ancestors ever taught me anything, it is that a warrior's greatness is not only measured by the strength of [Root.GetHerHis] arm or [Root.GetHerHis] skill with [Root.GetHerHis] weapon. To truly dominate a battlefield, one must know how to analyze the flow of battle and how to lead one's troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7033;Oh, [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] be cursed! Today I made a senseless mistake in the sparring ring which had devastating consequence. My opponent was not ready and [Root.GetHerHis] blade easily cut through my armor. Have my Ancestors withdrawn their protection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7034_A;My [Root.GetMarshalName] [Root.job_marshal.GetFirstName] has suggested some interesting changes concerning how we train and equip our soldiers. [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHeCap] claims the ideas came from a flash of inspiration. I am sure we have the Ancestors to thank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7034_B;One of my commanders has suggested some interesting changes concerning how we train and equip our soldiers. They claim the ideas came from a flash of inspiration. I am sure we have the Ancestors to thank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7035;It seems as if people from far and wide have heard of my offering to the Ancestors. Now they are flocking to join my armies in quest for the glory of old. Together we will honor the Ancestors on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7040;The last few seasons have been treating my capital [Root.Capital.GetName] well, and by well, I mean excellent! Trade is flourishing and even most peasants seem fed and happy. While I do take some credit for this prosperity, I am convinced that my Ancestors have been protecting us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7041_A;My [Root.GetTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetFirstName] has come to me with some new ideas regarding trade and infrastructure. All of them seem very promising. [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHeCap] claims the ideas came from a flash of inspiration. I am sure we have the Ancestors to thank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7041_B;One of my advisors has come to me with some new ideas regarding trade and infrastructure. All of them seem very promising. [Root.GetSheHeCap] claims the ideas came from a flash of inspiration. I am sure we have the Ancestors to thank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7042;Recently I have had good fortune and made quite a few bargains. At first, it was only some nice pelts and a new sword, but today I aided my [Root.GetTreasurerName] in striking an excellent deal regarding provisions for our soldiers. Could it be the Ancestors guiding me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7043;One of my subjects realized that I have been overtaxing everyone for quite some time, and now everyone knows it. Even though it was an honest mistake they refuse to send me the proper amounts, claiming that the difference has already been paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7044;The recent epidemics have ravaged my capital [Root.Capital.GetName] and its populace. However, during the last few months, the state of things have been improving – at least according to my ledger. I am certain that I have my ancestors to thank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7050;I have been contemplating the tales of my Ancestors. I am more than a little impressed by their wit and I think I have picked up a thing or two from my studies. They really are great source of inspiration and knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7051;An intriguing woman by the name of [ancestors_wise_woman.GetFirstName] recently joined my court. I could tell from the first moment that she was learned, and since then she has kept impressing me with her knowledge and sound reasoning. Her counsel is always welcome, no matter how harsh it might be. I know she is rarely mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7052;I know that my Ancestors always valued a wise and sharp mind, so I have decided to spend more time on my studies. Today I was out walking, contemplating the mysteries of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], when a new insight struck me. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7053;During the last few weeks, I have been studying the tales of my Ancestors with the aid of one of the elders. She keeps questioning me about the metaphors and underlying themes of these stories, but my answers never seem to impress her. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7054;I enter my study only to find a stunning owl perched on my window sill. It observes me with its piercingly yellow eyes for a few moments, and then taps the window with its beak. Did the Ancestors send it my way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7110;There are many deities whom you may chose to honor. Will it be Perun, God of Thunder, the fiercest of warriors? Or perhaps his eternal nemesis Veles, God of the Underworld? Jarilo, the springtime God of Fertility, and his sister Morana, wintry God of Death and Rebirth, also possess mighty powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7111;Perun, the God of Thunder, is the highest of all the gods. He sits atop the world tree from where he keeps watch over the earth and the skies. His sworn enemy is Veles the Serpent, who crawls up from the Underworld to steal his cattle and children. On stormy nights, thunder is a sign of Perun defending us against Veles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7112;While Perun might rule our earthly world, wise and sly Veles is the God of the Underworld, where all of us will end up one day. His realm is not a dark and barren one, but wet and lush. Veles' chosen devote their life to carrying out his desires in this world, with the hopes of a glorious afterlife in the next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7113;Jarilo, the God of Fertility, is the son of Perun. He and his sister Morana were born on new year's eve, although Jarilo was snatched from his cradle by Veles, and brought up as his son in the Underworld. When Jarilo returned to the earthly realm, he brought with him warmth and lushness, thus creating spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7114;Morana, the Goddess of Death and Rebirth, is a mighty but vengeful mistress. When her brother and husband Jarilo cheated on her, she slew him. Without him the world withered and froze, thus creating winter. Morana holds many secrets and spells which she bestows on her most faithful followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7200;There are many deities whom I can choose to follow. Will it be motherly Tsumburbura, Goddess of Fertility? Perhaps the moon spirit Ayyur, who knows how to guide me and help my negotiations? On the other hand, for wealth and prosperity, I could turn to the great snake Bida...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7201;Mighty and enlightening Ayyur is a spirit associated with the Moon. Like its light, Ayyur brings brightness in a dark. At night he reads the minds of all living creatures. He offers his inspiration and guidance to all who worship him and sacrifice to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7202;Bida, the great snake of Wagadu lives with all its seven heads in deep pit, hidden from eyes of mortals. Bida must be appeased with annual sacrifices and gifts, but in return, the snake eagerly bestows protection and abundance of gold and rain to those who serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7203;The mystical goddess Tsumburbura is the mother and founder of her people of Kano. She lives in a tree shrine on a Dala hill. She accepts any sacrifice and whoever pays her tribute, she shares her wisdom and power with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7204;All hail the mighty Dongo, the great warrior king who transcended the bonds of mortality to rule forever! His weapons are stones and lightning, with whom he vanquishes the unworthy and brings justice wherever he goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7205;There are many deities whom I can chose to follow. Will I seek glory in battle by praying to Dongo, or curry the favor of the spider-god Anansi? Yet, if I wish to be blessed with a balanced life, to grow wise and old, perhaps I should look at Dan for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7207;Great Anansi, share your secrets with me, and I shall keep them. The spider-god will guide me through the intricate web of lies out of which our world flourishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7208;Glory to the Rainbow Serpent, the holy mediator between spirits and the living, he who maintains balance, order, peace and communication across our worlds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7300;There are many deities whom you can chose to follow. Great Ukko, God of the Sky and the bringer of good harvests, or his wife Akka, Goddess of love and protection. Perhaps you will pray to Tapio and Mielikki, Master and Mistress of the Hunt. You may also dedicate your worship to the sly tempter Lempo...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7301;The domain of the great and mighty Ukko is the heavens. He rules over the weather and brings us good harvests. As he rides in his chariot, swinging his great hammer, he sends lightning bolts across the sky. As the chief of all gods, he grants his followers guidance in their rule and prosperity in their realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7302;Akka, Goddess of love, fertility and protection, is a gentle yet powerful mistress. She cares for all of her children, although especially mothers and infants. When thunder echoes between the mountains, it is Akka making love with her husband, the chief god Ukko.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7303;The woods are ruled by Tapio and Mielikki, God and Goddess of the Hunt. Those who pledge their allegiance to them shall always be blessed with true aim and strength of body. Mielikki is also a most accomplished healer and has a vast knowledge of all the herbs in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7304;Those who worship Lempo has chosen an erratic Master. While they may share many secrets regarding love and seduction, know that matters of the heart can be as dangerous as those of the sword. However, if you keep your wits about you, Lempo's lessons shall bring you power and influence beyond comprehension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7400;There are many deities whom you can chose to follow. The supreme ruler, our Father Dievas, or his ambitious brother Velnias, God of the Underworld. For luck in war, pray to Perkunas, God of Thunder. Zemyna, the Earth Goddess, blesses her faithful with fertility and good harvests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7401;Dievas, our Father, is the supreme ruler of all Gods and Goddessess. He has created all that which is good and wonderful in this world, including us. His rule is one of peace and understanding, and those are his gifts to faithful followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7402;Velnias the Serpent is God of Death and the Underworld. He is the brother of Dievas and the enemy of Perkunas. He can shapeshift into various animals, conjure up storms, and is a master of chaos and deception. Beware those who have been given his powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7403;Perkunas is the God of Thunder. He rides the skies in his chariot, with his magical axe in his hand. His eternal enemy is Velnias the Serpent, Lord of the Underworld, whom he protects us from. Those who are faithful to Perkunas will be given his courage and success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_7404;The Mother, Zemyna, is the fertile earth which nourishes us all. Every man and woman, animal and plant, owe their life force to her. When our lives in her green realm is over, we return to her again, to find the endless rest in her arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
