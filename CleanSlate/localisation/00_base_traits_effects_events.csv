EVTDESC3000;I managed to blame the monks at a nearby monastery for one of my more sensuous songs of courtly love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3001;After a pleasant evening with a... very special friend of mine, I found my purse empty. Luckily, I didn't carry that much gold with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3005;I have arranged a small tournament for my own enjoyment. I chose the most beautiful lady at the tournament and she accepted me as her champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3010;I was shamefully caught in action with a beautiful servant today by [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName]. [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHeCap] scolded me and lectured me in the virtues of chastity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3011;Oh, how much joy I've had from Ovidius. Clearly there must be something divine in his great writing. But why do I feel so guilty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3012;One of my knights is embroiled in a deep argument with one of his rivals about who is the legal heir to a small plot of land. This has a risk to turn into a feud in my demesne, so I have to make a judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3013;One of our vassals, a notoriously glutton, has invited us to a banquet. Naturally we attended, in a vain hope to improve feudal relations, but the banquet could have fed several villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3020;Words of my pledged chastity has reached the Pope who sent a courier with a letter of approval and his blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3021;Word of my pledged chastity has reached the Pope who have a sent a devout priest to guide me even closer to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3022;With the presence of an old and experienced scholar in the court, there is much to learn about the aspect of chastity and how this virtue leads us close to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3025;Every time I reject one of the desirable women who throw themselves in my way, the others increase their efforts. Do they wish for me to burn in hell?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3026;One of the lovely ladies who have been throwing themselves at me has finally cornered me in private, and there is no honorable way to get out of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3030;My chastity has lead my rivals to question my masculinity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3035;The rumors regarding me and my 'alleged' chastity have grown into ridicule. Something has to be done, or my reputation as a strong [Root.GetManWoman] and [Root.GetTitle] will suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3040;I love a good feast at my castle and I spared no expenses when I arranged the feast, the table was filled with geese, pork, cheese and plenty of wine. I doubt my guests left my halls with empty bellies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3045;I made sure the wine flowed and the plates were never empty. Some of us might had a bit more fun than the others and woke with a terrible headache, but it was surely worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3046;Truth be told, I never thought I would ever really like [From.GetTitledFirstName], but when [From.GetSheHe] held a great banquet we got drunk together and I had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3047;One of my courtiers have always acted a bit odd around me, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have relaxed a bit after the banquet. [From.GetSheHeCap] almost seems friendly now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3050;When I was younger, no one could defeat me at the tournaments nor in battle. Nowadays, I can barely mount my stallion. This is clearly not a healthy lifestyle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3055;My obesity and my hunger for food has left me with no desire left in my body. All that is left to me is to eat, eat and eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3056;Watching [From.GetTitledFirstName] eat is revolting! And [From.GetSheHe] eats all the time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3057;It was devastating to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s harsh critique: how my constant eating and bad table manners is revolting to everyone and that I severely need a diet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3060;In front of a tatty beggar's bowl a coin glittered. I snatched it from the mud before he could react and ignored his furious curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3065;I sacrificed one of my oldest friends today because of my greediness. One of my friend's enemies offered me a bribe I couldn't resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3070;My friend and I had planned to go hunting together but when he broke his leg I realized I either had to find someone else to accompany me or cancel it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3071;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to go hunting with [From.GetHerHim], I gladly accepted. Sadly, the hunt was ruined by [From.GetHerHis] greed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3072;We managed to kill too much prey when I went hunting with [From.GetTitledFirstName], so we decided to sell some of the meat. When we had sold everything we got in an argument over the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3075;The priest had to prod me with the collection bag several times before I gruffly put a coin in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3080;Being charitable is about loving other human beings and forgiving them the trespasses they do to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3081;Caring for the sick and infirm is one of the duties of charity. There are people in our court that needs our help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3082;One part of being charitable is to harbor the homeless. Several villages have been destroyed in a storm, and the peasants need somewhere to live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3083;Being charitable means that you have to love the sinner and admonish them for their sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3084;Thomas of Aquinas teaches us that upholding the virtue of Charity means to bear wrongs patiently. There are some people who dislike me personally and wish me bad luck, but I forgive them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3085;We are taught that to uphold the virtue of charity, we have to ransom our prisoners, and to forgive offenses willingly. I have prisoners in my dungeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3095;While walking together with [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] and discussing my finances, we met a couple of beggars. I knew [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] did not approve of alms, but the young mother with no shoes and a wailing baby could not be ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3096;I squirm and almost feel sick every time I see [From.GetTitledFirstName] hand out another shiny gold coin to yet another filthy and lice infested beggar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3097;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has a problem with my generosity towards the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3100;I have minimized the amount of work I need to do each day by delegating most of my workload onto my courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3105;The less I work, the more time I can spend with the people I really care about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3110;My slothfulness has caused part of my castle to deteriorate. I delegated the care of my castle to someone unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3115;One of the priests seems to have noticed that I fell asleep during his sermons this Sunday. I simply can't understand why slothfulness is not considered to be a virtue..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3116;I was greatly upset when the slothful [From.GetTitledFirstName] fell asleep during my sermon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3117;It seems that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is upset about me falling asleep during [From.GetHerHis] sermon. Now [From.GetSheHe] is giving me a long lecture about dedication to the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3120;My relations with [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is strained. To uphold the virtue of diligence it is vital to show loyalty and steadfastness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121;Being a feudal lord means working hard at keeping your personal relations with your vassals at an acceptable level. Sometimes though, they seem to have grudges against me, and I must work at eliminating those and instill proper loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3122;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is such an inspiring person. [From.GetSheHeCap] is such a diligent ruler, that I wish I could be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3123;Following the teachings of divinely inspired thinkers, a diligent human should strive for peaceful resolutions. I have members of my court who do not see eye to eye, and my duty as their liege is to arbitrate their disputes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3124;There are always things that need to be done when it comes to expanding and improving a castle.  With the proper planning, and diligent work, I can make sure the work becomes more efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3125;Since I am such a diligent person, I make sure that everything is as good as it can be.  When it comes to my fighting men, I can focus on one of two things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3126;I have fallen to the temptation of slothfulness. There are things I have neglected in my castle, things that should have been done, but I postponed them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3140;I know I am not the best warrior in the realm, but I so wish I was. There are men who appear to be better than I, and I wish I was like them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3141;Those that talk too sweetly at court are great at diplomacy. I begrudge them their ability, and I covet it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3142;I covet the stewardship ability of some of the people at court. I deserve to be better at managing my economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3143;There are so many great manipulators in the court, and I almost admire their skills if it weren't for the fact that I wish I had what they have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3144;There are people in the court that are so dedicated to learning. I wish I was more like them, and it vexes me that I am not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3145;I am still childless, and there are women at court with children who are younger than I. I should be the one with a young and healthy son in my arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3160;There is always a place at my table and a warm spot in front of the hearth for all the old men and women who have served me before and now have nowhere else to go. Their stories delight everyone and I see no need for them to be forgotten after long lives of hard work for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3161;The kindness of [From.GetTitledFirstName] is an example to us all. [From.GetSheHeCap] takes care of [From.GetHerHis] servants as they grow old and incapable of anything but the simplest of chores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3162;I almost blushed when [From.GetTitledFirstName] expressed [From.GetHerHis] admiration over my generosity and kindness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3170;Villagers are starving in [Root.Location.GetName] and a small group of representatives has dared set foot in my castle to petition for help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3175;One of the courtiers always treat the servants with contempt and if I hadn't interfered the courtier would likely have beaten one of the servants! I reprimanded the courtier and said: 'Kindness is a virtue, and you should show empathy and trust without prejudice even if your servant is a commoner.'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3176;A clumsy servant almost spilled wine all over me and I was about to slap him for his incompetence when [From.GetTitledFirstName] dragged me aside and told me: 'Kindness is a virtue, and you should show empathy and trust without prejudice even if your servant is a commoner.'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3177;No matter what I told [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetSheHe] wouldn't listen and refused to accept kindness as a virtue, not a weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3180;My courtiers fear me, they fear my outbursts of anger whenever they disobey and disappoint me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3185;I was a little bit surprised when a courtier asked if he could be the one to haggle with the merchants for once. I agreed, glad that someone else took the responsibility to discuss, haggle and threaten the merchants to a fair deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3186;I was talking to the merchant about his latest shipment of goods and tried to be diplomatic. For some reason he felt confident enough to try and cheat me on what was rightly mine, even if I hadn't paid him yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3187;A merchant tried to trick [From.GetTitledFirstName]! I had to interfere and I made sure he would never try that one on me or [From.GetFirstName] ever again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3190;I gave the priest such a scolding today when he dared ask me, his rightful liege and lord, for a donation! Isn't he living on my sufferance? Haven't I allowed him to collect money himself from his parish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3191;I overheard [From.GetTitledFirstName] when [From.GetSheHe] told the priest to sod off. The man only asked for a small donation for the orphanage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3192;As I exited the church I heard [From.GetTitledFirstName] mention my scolding of the priest to a couple of [From.GetHerHis] friends, sounding distressed and angry. I walked closer and as I approached them, [From.GetTitledFirstName] started showering me with insults before I even had a chance to explain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3193;After my scolding of the priest I left fuming with anger and was ready to slap whoever it was that touched my arm to stop me. In front of me stood [From.GetTitledFirstName], who told me that the priest certainly deserved the scolding, given all I had done for him and the church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3195;My mood swings, mostly from good-tempered to wroth, have made my courtiers fear me a little bit too much. It has caused me to lose prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3200;The holy book tells us that 'The patient man shows much good sense, but the quick-tempered man displays folly at its height'. There are people in my court who are quick to anger, and who may need a patient voice to calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3201;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is reasoning with us about our anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3202;The virtue of patience teaches us about endurance through moderation. By moderation in our life, health will improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3203;As St. Paul teaches us, 'Be patient with all. See that no one returns evil for evil, rather, always seek what is good for each other and for all'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3204;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent an emissary to me, saying [From.GetSheHe] has forgiven us some imagined slights.  I do not know what [From.GetHerHis] reasons are, but I will accept [From.GetHerHis] message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3205;By upholding the virtue of Patience, God teaches us to show mercy to sinners. What greater way to show mercy, than to forgive the greatest sinner, and pray with him or her for their salvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3206;Our sins have not gone unnoticed. My liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is inviting me to join [From.GetHerHim] in the chapel in an attempt to save my soul tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3207;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came to the chapel, with tears in [From.GetHerHis] eyes. We spent the night in prayer, until the sun went up. Praying desperately for the mercy of God..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3208;I spent the night alone in the chapel, praying hard for the salvation of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] never showed up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3220;I believe I can do great things so therefore I have put my mind to actually implement my ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3225;I have a great idea but no money to make my dream real. One of the travelling merchants who regularly visits [Root.Location.GetName] has shown interest in my idea but always changed his mind whenever I ask him to invest in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3226;[From.GetTitledFirstName] had been trying to convince the merchant to invest in one of [From.GetHerHis] ideas for several weeks but he had always refused, until today. The idea was actually quite good but I dared not give [From.GetTitledFirstName] the coins myself, instead I had given the merchant the coins needed and told him to pretend to be convinced and then invest in the idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3227;The merchant had apparently changed his mind and promised to finance my idea so I could begin working on it. I have a feeling [From.GetTitledFirstName] had something to do with the merchant's change of mind but I can care less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3230;I have taken such pride in myself lately that my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] noticed this and chided me about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3235;Someone laughed at me! I will find the culprit and make him or her choke on their laughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3236;I knew [From.GetTitledFirstName] was too proud for [From.GetHerHis] own good, but I accidentally managed to hurt [From.GetHerHis] pride and [From.GetSheHe] lashed out at me and called me many bad things. I don't know if I can forgive [From.GetHerHim] for those harsh words...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3237;When I found out who it was who had laughed at me, I tried to swallow my pride but I choked on it and it managed to escape. Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] won't talk to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3240;True humility is about showing humility when it is against our desires. A humble [Root.GetManWoman] submits to proper authority, even if [Root.GetSheHe] dislikes his lawful liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3241;My dear [This.GetTitle], I am your humble servant, and while I may not have always viewed you as favourably as I should, I sincerely regret my behavior.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3242;True humility is about showing humility when it is against our desires. A humble [Root.GetManWoman] submits to God, even if [Root.GetSheHe] may dislike the Pope himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3243;Recognising virtues and talents that other possess is truly a virtue. I am truly blessed by having a Marshal that is more formidable warrior than I could ever dream of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3244;My dear [This.GetTitle]. I just wish to inform you of how much I appreciate your talent and recognize that it is beyond my own.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3245;Recognising virtues and talents that other possess is a virtue. I am truly blessed by having a [Root.GetChancellorName] who is a marvel at diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3246;Recognising virtues and talents that other possess is truly a virtue. I am truly blessed by having a Spymaster who is brilliant in rooting out plots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3247;Recognising virtues and talents that other possess is truly a virtue. I am truly blessed by having a [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] who is a devout teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3248;Recognising virtues and talents that other possess is truly a virtue. I am truly blessed by having a Steward that truly knows how to govern a realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3258;I am very ambitious, but I also know that I am not great at everything. Being humble means I can recognize the limit of my talent, and not reach for what is beyond my grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3260;I am not the most martial of rulers and sometimes it appears as if I am almost incompetent when it comes to behaving like a knight. Luckily, I know how to manipulate people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3261;I simply can not keep up with handling the day to day business of my demesne. I rely on others, but manipulate them to believe that I am doing the harder things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3262;Sometimes the niceties of diplomacy pass me by and puts me in awkward positions. However, by careful manipulation of my court, I've managed to let my courtiers take the blame when things go bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3263;I am not a bookish person and if it weren't for some careful comments in some discussions this would become obvious to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3264;I am not the most martial of rulers and sometimes it appears as if I am almost incompetent when it comes to handling the sword. Luckily, I know how to manipulate people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3280;There is just so many sinners at court. I am just too honest a person to keep quiet when I see someone with a vice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3281;[From.GetBestName] has utterly embarrassed me in front of the entire court. [From.GetSheHeCap] is claiming that I am sinful and full of vice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3282;I am torn between my honesty and my ability to intrigue. It is stressful to attempt to be both, and I simply do not know how I should behave at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3283;I know when someone is a good ruler, and my liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is a [Root.Liege.GetManWoman] with virtues. [Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] deserves praise and respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3284;My faithful vassal, [From.GetBestName] is rather honest, and have publicly spoken about my virtues. This has radicalized my vassals, where some agree and some do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3285;My dear [This.GetTitle], I wanted to thank you for your virtuous rule. You are an inspiration to me.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3300;I stayed behind when a couple of my friends went hunting as I have never been able to see blood without fainting. Their hunting luck was good and we feasted on wild boar meat that evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3305;Everyone else ran off to chase the alleged thieves who had stolen a very valuable object from our church. Instead of following them, I went to the church and discovered the chalice hidden behind one of the benches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3306;I have had times when the cowardice of [From.GetTitledFirstName] made me doubt [From.GetHerHim]. But the way [From.GetSheHe] handled the situation when everybody else ran in different directions to try and catch a chalice thief made me reevaluate [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3307;I had not really expected anyone to truly care about the missing chalice, at the time it seemed more like an excuse to make as much noise and tumult as possible. I was proven wrong when [From.GetTitledFirstName] shook my hand and thanked me for finding the chalice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3310;The sound of blade against blade makes me shiver and the fierce roars from the fighting men makes me want to run and hide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3315;I wake up screaming in the night. The darkness scares me, and I keep wondering how I will last through this campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3316;I found [From.GetTitledFirstName] in [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber, hiding from the sound of soldiers practising their sword fighting. I could not help but scorn [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3320;I knew there was a huge bear somewhere near the caves in [Root.Location.GetName] and a courtier of mine had insisted to come along when my men and I went hunting for the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3321;[From.GetTitledFirstName] saved me from a huge bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3322;The beast was huge, bigger than any bear I had ever seen. I fought him bravely but only managed to slay him after he wounded several of my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3325;I was one of the first to saddle my horse and chase after the bandits who had stolen one of the valuable chalices from our church. When I returned, exhausted and with filthy clothes, I was told the old priest had simply misplaced the chalice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3330;While searching for a lost chalice, I came upon a band of rogues who robbed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3335;For the past two years, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has risked [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] life countless of times. A broken leg, a nearly fatal wound and an accident that might have left [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] blind has not slowed [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3336;[From.GetTitledFirstName] feels I risk too much with my escapades and tried to persuade me to stop risking my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3340;I almost swallowed my tongue when a friendly courtier paid his respects to me. He thought I was displeased with him and he left perplexed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3345;I was especially invited to my friend's sermon and it was a catastrophe! The poor man stumbled, lost his words and it was all an incomprehensible mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3346;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seemed to appreciate my first sermon, even if [From.GetSheHe] did not put it in so many words. [From.GetTitledFirstName] just nodded and smiled when I asked if [From.GetSheHe] liked it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3347;I did not dare tell [From.GetTitledFirstName] what I thought about [From.GetHerHis] sermon, so I just smiled and nodded nervously when [From.GetTitledFirstName] talked to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3350;An important guest arrived today and was most insulted when I, struck with tongue-tiedness, was unable to greet him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3355;I have avoided my courtiers for so long, one of them has started to mistrust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3356;It is impossible to try and get a hold of [From.GetTitledFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] always has some sort of excuse to get away from me, ignores me or even hides from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3357;After ducking out of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s sight, I realized that [From.GetSheHe] must have seen me and felt ridiculous. Oddly, the [From.GetManWoman] ignored me and seemed to have stopped taking notice of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3360;I always knew my ambition would help me reach great places and to acquire some wealth during the way is always a nice bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3365;I have risen so fast to the top that other people regard me with envy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3366;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s ambition has helped [From.GetHerHim] get where [From.GetSheHe] wanted to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3367;[From.GetTitledFirstName] begged me to help [From.GetHerHim] become as successful as I. It was almost disgusting how [From.GetSheHe] admired my ambition and success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3370;I told the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] about my ambitions and asked if there was anything he could do to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3375;I know that one of my slothful courtiers is capable of more than he realizes. I want to push the courtier into being more ambitious, I believe there's great potential in that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3376;It's hard being friends with someone more ambitious than yourself, and lately [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been pushing me to exert my talents beyond my limits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3377;It is apparently annoying to be friends with someone more ambitious than yourself, why else would [From.GetTitledFirstName] ignore me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3378;My subtle ways of pushing [From.GetTitledFirstName] into showing [From.GetHerHis] true potential has worked wonders! It is as if [From.GetSheHe] has realized how fun it can be to be ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3380;I am happy with my place in life, I can't think of anything I would rather do than just take care of myself and my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3381;Being around [From.GetTitledFirstName] makes me feel calm and satisfied. The contentedness of [From.GetHerHim] is contagious and all the world's trouble seem less frightening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3382;I have feared for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s sanity, [From.GetSheHe] has not been [From.GetHerselfHimself] lately. To help ease [From.GetHerHis] problems, I made [From.GetHerHim] join me in the garden to relax and just talk about whatever [From.GetSheHe] needed to talk about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3385;I would be content with visiting the church every other Sunday, but if I don't show up the priest scolds me and tells me I should set a better example for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3390;My content lifestyle costs a bit, but I don't mind paying for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3395;Yesterday I found a book and read it for a while, then I put it somewhere and went for a walk in the garden, vaguely thinking I should get back to it later. Today, I found the book again but couldn't remember what it was about so I started reading it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3396;[From.GetTitledFirstName] just drifts around, doing nothing productive and nothing interesting. If only [From.GetSheHe] could get off [From.GetHerHis] butt and be more ambitious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3397;There are people who think I should be more ambitious and find something to strive towards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3400;My subjective opinions have always given me more praise than criticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3405;I stood by the stained glass windows and tried to look through them when the priest approached me and asked me what I thought about them. A courtier by my side spoke before I managed to say some very unfair opinions about the multitude of colors used.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3406;The church had just gotten some very beautiful stained glass windows and as I and [From.GetTitledFirstName] contemplated the windows the priest approached us and asked what we thought about them. I had thought about the symbolism of the windows while [From.GetTitledFirstName] just repeated what I had said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3407;I tried to get away with repeating [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s opinion about the stained glass window, but [From.GetHerHis] probing questions made me confess in the end. I hated the colors and the motif was just stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3408;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] had told the priest what [From.GetSheHe] thought about the stained glass windows, both looked inquiring at me until I managed to croak something appraising about the windows, using some of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s opinions. The priest seemed satisfied and [From.GetTitledFirstName] beamed at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3410;My arbitrariness just cost me several gold coins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3411;I had two men pleading for my mercy in my court today. Both of them had committed the same crime, stolen an object of minor value - one a bread and the other some rice. The bread stealer was beheaded, the rice thief absolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3412;I witnessed [From.GetTitledFirstName] judge the two men and [From.GetHerHis] verdict made me ponder the matter for several days. Why would [From.GetTitledFirstName] sentence one man to be beheaded and absolve the other when they had committed the same crime?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3413;The men, whose similar crimes I judged arbitrarily, gave [From.GetTitledFirstName] something to ponder. I had all but forgotten about it when [From.GetTitledFirstName] finally got the courage to discuss it with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3415;I tend to let female thieves and bandits get away with lighter sentences than men. I might condemn a woman to a few months in prison whilst a man might get one of his hands chopped off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3416;I have noticed that [From.GetTitledFirstName] favors female thieves over male ones, giving the women lighter sentences. Men often loses one hand while women get condemned to a couple of months in jail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3417;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems upset with my arbitrary nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3418;I didn't think anyone had noticed that I give lighter sentences to women than men, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] was all in favor of giving men more severe punishments than women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3420;I could not help but overhear the stablemaster and a courtier's animated discussion. Something about a horse and a payment due today, but the courtier insisted on paying the stablemaster later that week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3421;A rather heated discussion between myself and the stablemaster caught [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s attention and after listening to us both [From.GetSheHe] settled the matter between me and the stablemaster in a fair way. I got the horse, the stablemaster got the coin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3422;I settled the matter between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and my stablemaster, I tried to be as just as I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3425;A murmur was heard through the room when I judged the felon to death. It was a just sentence, if perhaps a bit harsh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3430;I was about to lose a bet and although I felt inclined to cheat, I had to be just even though it cost me some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3435;Word stood against word, the farmer's against a courtier's about damage caused to the farmer's house by a cow owned by the courtier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3436;It was a rather trivial matter that I wanted [From.GetTitledFirstName] to solve, an argument between a lowly farmer and myself. The farmer claimed I should pay for the damage caused to his house by my cow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3437;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approved of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3438;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not happy with my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3440;I stumbled into a courtier eating cookies outside the kitchen. The courtier apologised several times and then offered me a cookie as an apology for being in my path and the cynic in me got the best of me. I lost myself in cynical comments about how the courtier was trying to poison me with baked goods, probably spoken out loud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3441;One cynical comment after another... I could not take it anymore, I even tried to bribe [From.GetTitledFirstName] so [From.GetSheHe] would shut up and stop firing cynical remarks at me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3442;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wants me to stop being cynical. That is a promise I will not be able to hold but I won't disturb [From.GetHerHim] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3445;My cynical comments have made people look at things my way. I have created more cynics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3450;Everybody lies and the courtiers in [Root.Location.GetName] are no exception. One of them dared to speak up and tell me I'm too cynical and not everybody lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3451;I have grown tired of the cynical ways of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] conviction that everybody lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3452;After [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me not everybody lies I almost started laughing. I told [From.GetHerHim] that if [From.GetSheHe] could prove that, I would start believing in mankind again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3455;I expressed my views on the whole religion and '[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]' thing a bit too loud and got into a lot of trouble with a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] because of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3460;A holy man came to court today to talk about matters of faith, but it soon became clear he held rather unorthodox views. Being a zealous defender of the church at all times, I believe I did the right thing when I gave the order to imprison a blasphemous pagan who dared criticise my faith and my church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3461;I watched, partly horrified, partly filled with admiration, as the blasphemer was dragged out of the dining hall and into [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3462;I was still shaking with rage at the pagan's blasphemous words when [From.GetTitledFirstName] took the opportunity to whisper: 'Good work' in my ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3465;My zeal and religious beliefs have led me to become more respected and given me more prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3470;There's always something to do in the [Root.Religion.GetName] church. The more time I spend there, the more I appreciate the calm and I feel more connected to my God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3471;Ever since [From.GetFirstName] became engaged in the church's different activities, or, rather, started following every order from the priest and wasting time, [From.GetSheHe] has stopped spending time with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3472;I have had little time for [From.GetTitledFirstName] since I became engaged in the church's different activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3475;The church is a greedy thing who always need more alms but I have deep pockets and it's for a good cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3476;A [christian.GetGroupName] priest came to my court today to talk about matters of faith, but it soon became clear he only wanted to convert us to his faith! As a zealous [muslim.GetGroupName] I believe I did the right thing when I gave the order to imprison this infidel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3477;I watched, partly horrified, partly filled with admiration, as the infidel was dragged out of the dining hall and into [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3478;I was still shaking with rage at the infidel's outrageous words when [From.GetTitledFirstName] took the opportunity to whisper: 'Good work' in my ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3480;Something is rotten in [Root.Location.GetName]! I have had suspicions about a plot, maybe an assassination or something... horrifying unraveling in front of my unseeing eyes and I will find out what is going on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3481;The cook and I did not really plan to humiliate [From.GetTitledFirstName], we only wanted [From.GetHerHim] to realize how [From.GetHerHis] paranoia made everybody's life more difficult than it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3482;I caught the cook and [From.GetTitledFirstName] plotting against me! When I confronted them they denied it at first but broke down eventually and confessed that they were planning to humiliate me, how they planned to do that they refused to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3485;Every time I ride out to hunt, I hear an arrow whiz past me, and it is only because I anticipate it that I can avoid it. No one else seems to notice it, and I have stopped trying to convince my friends that it is real.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3490;My supper was brought to me by a courtier I almost trust, but the smell and the color of the soup was highly suspicious. After tasting it, I threw the bowl at the courtier, narrowly missing with just an inch or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3491;I have put up with the accusations, the distrust and especially [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s paranoia, but everyone has a breaking point and I will soon reach mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3492;The thrown bowl and my accusations about [From.GetHerHim] trying to poison me greatly upset [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I fear I might have lost my friend's respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3495;There are so many people out to get me. Their eyes are staring at me constantly, and I am sure they are plotting against me in open sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3500;My friend became aghast when I told him that I had sent the miller's boy to a nearby city with my finest stallion. 'You will never see that horse again', he said, utterly convinced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3505;I was fed up with a courtier's constant nagging about a decrepit bridge in need of fixing and decided to inspect it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3506;The bridge I wanted [From.GetTitledFirstName] to inspect burst under [From.GetHerHis] unwary feet and [From.GetSheHe] only just managed to grab hold of my hand and the edge of the broken bridge. I saw how [From.GetHerHis] fingers began to slip and, grasping [From.GetHerHis] wrists, ordered [From.GetHerHim] to let go of the bridge and as [From.GetSheHe] did exactly that, I pulled as hard as I can and dragged [From.GetHerHim] back to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3507;If I had not trusted [From.GetTitledFirstName], I wouldn't be alive. I was hanging from the broken edge of the bridge with my one hand and the other was firmly held by [From.GetFirstName]. The bridge was about to break when [From.GetSheHe] told me to let go of the bridge and as I did that [From.GetSheHe] pulled me up onto the bridge and saved me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3510;It was a bad idea to lend money to a person I had never met before, but I trusted the man and his idea so I gave him some money to help him make his dream come true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3515;I was a bit distracted when I handed my buzzard to a courtier, I was watching another of my birds who were about to catch another rabbit and did not realize that the eager courtier had no clue of what to do with the buzzard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3516;I offered to hand [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s buzzard to the falconer, but was careless enough to forget to put on its hood, and then lost my grip on the jesses as the bird flew to freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3517;This is the last time I trust someone with my birds! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was supposed to give my buzzard to the falconer but slipped and lost [From.GetHerHis] grip of the bird and it escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3520;My celibacy is starting to get on my [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s nerves and [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] advances are getting a bit desperate and annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3521;It feels like weeks since someone touched me! [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s celibacy and dismissal of my advancements makes me feel unwanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3525;I tried to not show how flattering it was to be asked about celibacy and if I had some sort of advice. Unfortunately, I had not the time to talk about right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3526;The idea of celibacy has always appealed to me but I would really like to talk about it with someone before I make up my mind and decide if I would venture down the road of abstinence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3527;A young [From.GetManWoman] asked me many questions about celibacy, why I had decided to take this vow and if I had any advice on what [From.GetSheHe] should do. I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] that the decision was [From.GetHerHis] own and that celibacy was not for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3530;A celibate life can be hard, but I fear life is harder for one of my courtiers whose sins our confessor often attack during his sermons. The poor sod's vices and lusts are controlling him and I don't envy him his time in purgatory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3531;That smug 'holier than thou' smile [From.GetTitledFirstName] always has when [From.GetSheHe] sees me is devastating for my self-confidence. It is as if [From.GetSheHe] knows a dirty secret about me no one else knows about, and all I want to do is scream that nobody is perfect and everyone can fall, but some have a higher horse to fall from and I hope [From.GetTitledFirstName] will learn that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3532;[From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to wipe the smug smile off my face when [From.GetSheHe] confronted me about it. I accidently spilled some of the secrets I know and [From.GetSheHe] scoffed at them, telling me that 'everyone has sired or conceived a bastard' which is not exactly true but still made me feel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3535;Every other day, processions with people singing, carrying crosses and whipping themselves are marching through [Root.Location.GetName]. They ask to be forgiven for sins they have committed and believe the flagellation to work better than any other penance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3536;We walked through the village, lashing our skins with whips for every step we took. As a [Root.GetTitle] this felt slightly humiliating but I stood tall and continued my pilgrimage together with my fellow flagellants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3537;[From.GetTitledFirstName] walked together with the others through the streets of [From.Location.GetName], praying and flagellating [From.GetHerselfHimself] with a cattail whip made of knotted cords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3538;Even before [From.GetTitledFirstName] opened [From.GetHerHis] mouth, I knew [From.GetSheHe] would comment on the pilgrimage I took while flagellating myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3540;It has come to my knowledge that one of my courtiers could teach me more about history and other subjects I feel I have neglected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3541;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is going to ask me any minute now if I can teach [From.GetHerHim] more about the subjects [From.GetSheHe] lacks knowledge of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3542;After numerous lessons I grew a bit bored but endured several more before [From.GetTitledFirstName] declared that [From.GetSheHe] could not teach me any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3543;Our shared love for books should help me win the friendship of a stubborn courtier. I should be able to find the booklover in the library...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3544;While reading one of my favorite books in the library, a book of hours from [Root.Location.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] entered with much ado. Irritated, I put the book back in its proper place and tried to leave without [From.GetTitledFirstName] taking notice, but [From.GetSheHe] managed to intercept me and started talking about the book of hours I had read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3545;When I got to the library I intercepted [From.GetTitledFirstName] just when [From.GetSheHe] was about to leave. Desperate, I saw that the book [From.GetSheHe] had been reading was one of my own favorites, the book of hours from [From.Location.GetName] and asked what [From.GetTitledFirstName] thought about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3546;Did that child of mine like myths and legends or is it more interested in history? I choose between a book filled with fascinating legends and one, somewhat dryer tome filled with history about battles and politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3547;It is always interesting when my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is trying to interest [From.GetHerselfHimself] in me. Wonder what it'll be this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3548;I was not entirely sure if my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] enjoyed the stories I told [From.GetHerHim], but I kept reading until we both were nearly asleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3550;A new load of books arrived and I can barely fit the new books in the overcrowded library. Maybe it is time to build a new one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3551;I had patience with [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s obsession with books until they started to invade our bedchamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3552;I had noticed that [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s obsession with books had increased during these last weeks, but I hadn't realized to what degree until I overheard [From.GetHerHim] talking to a master building about demolishing the wall between my rooms and the library in order to get more space for [From.GetHerHis] books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3553;[From.GetTitledFirstName] believes I am obsessed with books! I am not a book addict! I just love reading them, smelling them, caressing them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3555;My favorite rose bush was about to burst into bloom with the largest, reddest and most beautiful rosebud opening its petal last. I decided to give it to someone, but who?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3556;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gave me a pretty rose from [From.GetHerHis] garden. It smelled as beautiful as it looked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3557;[From.GetTitledFirstName] loved the rose and thanked me profusely. I think I was this close to get a peck on the cheek but [From.GetSheHe] must have realized that that wouldn't be proper, making [From.GetHerHim] blush almost as red as the rose and then [From.GetSheHe] almost ran away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3558;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not seem happy at all when I presented [From.GetHerHim] with the rose. Despite its fragrance and beauty [From.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me stiffly and left as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3559;[From.GetTitledFirstName] had a huge rose pinned to [From.GetHerHis] clothes and as soon as I saw it I realized it couldn't have come from any place else than [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s garden. I wanted to rip the rose off [From.GetTitledFirstName] and yell at [From.GetHerHim] for having an affair with my spouse, but I controlled myself and turned away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3560;No matter what I tried my vegetables and flowers never sprouted and grew as large and beautiful as one of my courtiers'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3561;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s garden looks miserable, the vegetables are wilting and the flowers are unable to spread their petals due to lack of water and nutrients. My garden, however, prospered and was bound to give me a rich harvest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3562;[From.GetTitledFirstName] revealed a stinking secret to [From.GetHerHis] green fingers, [From.GetSheHe] uses manure from cows and sheep to give [From.GetHerHis] plants nutrients that they supposedly need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3563;A new sort of roses has arrived to [Root.Location.GetName] by the means of a travelling merchant. The price he demanded for it was outrageous but I was still tempted to buy it as his description of the damask rose were that of a rose most fragrant and roseate in color.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3564;Although, I must admit the new Damask rose is adorable and complements our garden, the price [From.GetFirstName] paid for it was intimidating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3565;The new Damask rose is adorable and complements the garden, but the price [From.GetTitledFirstName] paid for it was intimidating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3566;[From.GetTitledFirstName] chided me about the Damask rose I had bought. Even if [From.GetSheHe] loved it and thought it complemented the garden, the price had been too costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3567;[From.GetTitledFirstName] praised the new rose but was astounded when I let slip how much it had cost. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me I should be more careful with money, even if the rose complemented the garden it had cost a little bit too much to justify it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3568;A beehive in one of the hollow trees in the garden should be filled with honey by now. As the bees had started to behave aggressively and had stung several people from my court, I decided to remove the nest and salvage the honey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3569;I was asked by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to help [From.GetHerHim] remove a beehive and I reluctantly followed [From.GetHerHim] to take a look at it before I made any rash promises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3570;I need someone to help me in my next scheme! A wonderful book has been discovered by a close friend of mine but he refuses to give or sell it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3571;I had also heard about the book [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s friend had found when he inventoried his father's library. Unfortunately, this friend refused to sell the book to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I despaired of ever getting to read it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3572;With our united efforts it was a cinch to procure the book from my friend. [From.GetTitledFirstName] had been a bit sceptical to my plan first but [From.GetHerHis] desire to lay hands on the book overcame [From.GetHerHis] fear of getting caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3575;I knew one of the courtiers was a member in a highly secret group called 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]' and as a mystic this sounded fascinating! I wanted in, no matter what the price might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3576;I have tried to keep 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]' a secret from [From.GetTitledFirstName] but [From.GetHerHis] curiosity and an unfortunate coincidence made [From.GetHerHim] aware of the group. I felt compelled to include [From.GetTitledFirstName] or else 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]' might not be a secret anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3577;My inquiries led me to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and when I started bombarding [From.GetHerHim] with questions [From.GetSheHe] tried to convince me there was no such thing as 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]' but I kept going until [From.GetSheHe] gave up. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that I needed to go through a dangerous initiation to become a member of the group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3578;My inquiries led me to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and when I started bombarding [From.GetHerHim] with questions [From.GetSheHe] tried to convince me there was no such thing as 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]' but I kept going until [From.GetSheHe] gave up. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that I needed to go through a skill-based initiation to become a member of the group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3579;I did not think [From.GetTitledFirstName] would agree to the initiation and I had a hard time figuring out what [From.GetHerHis] initiation should be like. I decided that, despite what I had told [From.GetTitledFirstName], I would give [From.GetHerHim] a skill-based dangerous initiation: [From.GetSheHe] would have to handle alchemical substances and make a love potion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3580;It was hard and dangerous work, the alchemical compounds was both flammable and poisonous and I feared the love potion would not be good enough, might even poison or kill those who ingested it. It was tested on a swineman and a milkmaid, who immediately fell in love and into the hay stack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3581;I don't know what went wrong with the love potion, the alchemical compounds did not react to each other as I was used to. It poisoned the swineman and milkmaid we tried it on, nobody died but they had to stay in bed for a week or two...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3585;My alchemy 'kit' arrived with a small book, containing instructions for how to mix different substances without causing things to explode or start burning. It might be a good idea to read the book before fiddling with the alchemical ingredients...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3586;The liquid dripped through the labyrinth of glass bottles blown in various forms and sizes. As it reached the end of the funnel, a drop of the liquid quivered on the edge before it slowly fell towards the awaiting bowl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3587;As the liquid slowly but steadily dripped into the bowl I waited eagerly for the substance to cool down. When finally every last drop was in the bowl darkness enveloped the castle and I had to light a candle to properly examine the liquid, which exploded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3588;The disappointment I felt when the liquid solidified was quickly replaced by joy when I realized that, instead of a Philosopher's Stone, I had created...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3590;This illness is slowly killing me, sucking the life out of my bones and brain. Being a mystic I have knowledge of a potion rumored to cure any illness but even as I prepare the potion I fear it might kill me instead of curing me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3591;Small blue butterflies flies around my head and their tickling wings makes me laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3592;When the last drop of the potion had ran down my throat and nothing spectacular had happened, as in it making me violently sick or blow me to pieces, I opened my eyes and took a deep breath. I felt wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3593;I encrypted the formula for the health potion so well that even I had trouble deciphering it. The main ingredient were mercury, if I understand my scribbling notes correctly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3594;I am desperate for a cure, the sickness seems to get worse for every day. I heard [From.GetTitledFirstName] had concocted something that [From.GetSheHe] said could cure all illnesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3595;I warned [From.GetTitledFirstName] that the potion wasn't perfect! When I tried to decipher my own decryptions I did not manage to get the right measurements for the ingredients and so I had to guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3596;The potion worked like a charm, [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] had never felt so good ever before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3597;I killed [From.GetTitledFirstName] with my concoction!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3600;A metal worker named Perillos introduced a new invention of his today: a brazen bull. Intrigued by the design, I asked him to demonstrate it for me and the result was terrifying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3601;[From.GetTitledFirstName] bought a brazen bull today! The terrifying torture device was demonstrated and the agonising screams of its victim converted to the sound of an infuriated bull bellowing echoed throughout the courtyard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3602;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not like the brazen bull at all, [From.GetSheHe] ordered me to get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3603;[From.GetTitledFirstName] congratulated me on the purchase of a brazen bull, [From.GetSheHe] thought it would inspire fear in our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3604;I decided to investigate if [From.GetTitledFirstName] had come to [From.GetHerHis] senses and gotten rid of the brazen bull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3605;No matter what I did to my prisoner, he refused to admit anything! Frustrated, I left him in the hands of a courtier only to return half an hour later finding a written confession with the prisoner's signature on it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3606;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] had left the torture chamber and its victim in frustration over the man's stubborn silence, I decided to try my old skills on him. It did not take long before I had a written confession with the man's signature on it and [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3607;It was horrifying but oddly satisfying to watch [From.GetTitledFirstName] demonstrate [From.GetHerHis] skills on a recently captured traitor. After demonstrating how much pain [From.GetSheHe] could cause before the man passed out, [From.GetSheHe] taught me how to cause maximum pain and damage but still keep the victim alive for several days, or even weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3610;I need a confession from one of my prisoners or else I have to release him. I would prefer not to have to use torture on him but maybe the mere threat would make him speak up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3611;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] torture methods and the mere description of what would be done to me if I did not confess was enough to make me wet my pants in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3612;Would my prisoner [From.GetTitledFirstName], despite the colorful description of all the horrors that would be inflicted on [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] did not confess, refuse and force me to make reality of my threats?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3615;It is time to pass my legacy to my child! The torture methods I have refined, the secrets only I and other master impalers know and the use of instruments of torture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3616;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] asked me if I wanted to watch a prisoner being tortured. [From.GetSheHeCap] wants me to become a master torturer, an Impaler, just as [From.GetSheHe] is [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3617;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a natural! I would never have anticipated how fast [From.GetSheHe] learned the use of the instruments of torture and how [From.GetSheHe] came up with ingenious new ways of using them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3618;The disgust in [From.GetFirstName]'s face when I asked [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] wanted to watch me torture a prisoner was answer enough. My [GetFromRelation] would never follow in my footsteps!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3620;I have been challenged to a duel! Although I am a great duelist, I still find the need for some training and the finest second in [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3621;Through rumors I learned that [From.GetTitledFirstName] had been challenged to a duel and [From.GetSheHe] will probably ask me to be [From.GetHerHis] second.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3622;My opponent withdrew from the duel! I was able to learn something new from [From.GetTitledFirstName] though, so it did not feel too unnecessary to have troubled [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3625;I could not stand being insulted even one more time, so I slapped my insulter and thus, the glove was thrown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3626;The minute [From.GetHerHis] hand hit my cheek I knew [From.GetTitledFirstName] challenge was serious. A duel, not to the death but to the first drop of blood spilled, is a matter of pride and honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3627;The first blood was spilled by me and as we both had agreed that was as far as we would take it I honorably refrained from plunging my sword into [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3628;I refused to surrender when [From.GetTitledFirstName] drew the first blood by cowardly slice my face from cheek to chin! Almost blinded by the blood I tried to keep fighting but the seconds caught hold of me and made me surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3629;That coward [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to fight me! I won by default but it was a bitter victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3630;Not a week goes by without me challenging or getting challenged by someone to a duel. It is mostly friendly duels, just something we do to have a bit of fun, to distract us from duties and responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3631;Whenever I seek my [From.GetFirstName] I find [From.GetHerHim] either challenging someone to a duel or fighting someone in a duel. I shouldn't worry, the duels are never so serious that someone will get seriously wounded, it's mostly to first blood but still..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3632;Although the duels between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and whoever [From.GetSheHe] has challenged or been challenged by never ends with one of the duelists severely wounded, only with smaller cuts and bruises, I still fear for [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3633;I had just finished a friendly duel and was on my way to my bedchamber for a change of clothes when [From.GetTitledFirstName] said [From.GetSheHe] wanted a word with me. As I had feared, [From.GetSheHe] asked me to be more careful and not accept nor challenge anyone to a duel for some time, preferably for ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3635;The city of [duel_location.GetName] is famous for its swords and the people wielding them. I had been wanting to test my skill against a local or two, but I was minding my own business when a local noble indicated I had insulted him by throwing down his glove in front of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3636;I did not like the look of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and challenged [From.GetHerHim] to a duel. [From.GetSheHeCap] accepted and was gracious enough to allow me to choose weapon for the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3637;I laughed out loud when [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s second told me what kind of weapon we would use in the duel: a moorish cannon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3638;I could not believe my ears when [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s second told me what kind of weapon we would use in the duel: a forkful of animal excrement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3639;It came as no suprise to me when [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s second told me to bring my sword to the duel, I was just glad I didn't have to fight with a sledgehammer, or, [Root.Religion.GetName] forbide, something disgusting as animal excrement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3640;As a devoted Hunter, I have filled my castle with many trophies from the wild beasts I have hunted and killed myself. Still, there is a place above my fireplace waiting for a special trophy: the head of a white hart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3641;I heard [From.GetTitledFirstName] is looking for a skilled hunter who could help [From.GetHerHim] hunt down a white hart as its head is the last trophy [From.GetSheHe] yearned for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3642;I could never have done it without [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s hunting skills! After several day looking for trails and droppings we finally found a clear track. The white hart seemed to wait for my arrow and merely shivered when it pierced its heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3645;As I oversaw the hunting party's last preparations I realized we were one man short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3646;My work as a [Root.GetJobTitle] is never done, so when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to join the hunting party I hesitated before I answered [From.GetHerHim]:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3647;My [GetFromRelation] asked me if I wanted to join [From.GetHerHim] on the hunt. It would be several hours on horseback, not knowing if any game would be found nor if there would be any real hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3648;[From.GetTitledFirstName] joined us for the hunt and almost immediately we found the tracks of a large herd of deer. Almost everyone managed to kill some game and [From.GetTitledFirstName] killed two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3649;I was disappointed to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not want to join the hunt, but it was probably for the best. Some hours after we finally had found some game to hunt, it started to rain and the tracks disappeared completely. We returned empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3650;A huge boar keeps me out of the forest, a wild beast whose grunting and squealing is heard throughout the forest whenever anyone dares to set foot in its territory. I cannot hunt and the swineherds cannot let their swine graze within the forest without being attacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3651;When I approached the forest the boar started squealing and grunting, but did not show itself. [From.GetTitledFirstName] had sent me out with one order: 'Kill the boar!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3652;Even the dogs I brought with me recoiled when they heard the angry boar snarling and squealing menacingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3653;The boar's death cry could be heard miles away and when [From.GetTitledFirstName] returned from the successful hunt I greeted [From.GetHerHim] warmly. The cook took the boar away to prepare it for the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3654;I waited eagerly for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s return but when [From.GetSheHe] entered without the boar I could not hide my discontent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3655;I overheard a conversation between two courtiers, they discussed how some in the court feared the Wild Hunt and laughed at how superstitious some can be. I decided to look into this and find out who this superstitious mind belonged to. Maybe I can have some fun with this fear of the Wild Hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3656;The storyteller told the tale about the Wild Hunt. The story gave me shivers but the drink made me brave, so instead of sleeping in the tavern I made my way to the castle. I regretted it when the black, huge and hideous huntsmen riding on black horses, with black dogs by their side started chasing me. I screamed and ran for my life, until I heard the huntsmen break out in laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3657;There were no real black horses in the stable, so we took the darkest ones and muddied them down, making sure when they had any white marks that they were covered. Then we all dressed in black and fetched the blackest dogs before we rode out to scare [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3660;My poem went all wrong, the feeling I wanted to express lost among the words and the result was just a piece of spoiled pergament. This failure made me question my passion for writing poetry, even more so as the new poet at court had demonstrated his superior memory and mastery only yesterday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3661;Wherever I went, I would find [From.GetTitledFirstName] brooding over yet another of [From.GetHerHis] unfinished poems. I was not surprised when, after seeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] trying to tear up the parchment by hand, [From.GetSheHe] waved me forward when [From.GetSheHe] saw me and handed me the parchment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3662;Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nThe sun shows its beauty - But true beauty is in you...'\nAstonished, I noticed the tears in [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] told me there was nothing more left for [From.GetHerHim] to teach me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3665;I was deeply absorbed in writing an ode to a nightingale when I was approached and asked if I could recite some of my poems for the court. Everyone had gathered inside to ride out the storm that had hit [Root.Location.GetName] so I had a fairly large audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3670;With [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s help it was easy to remove the beehive, until we dropped it on the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3671;I had to remove the beehive all by myself when [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to go near it. It looked harmless but [From.GetTitledFirstName] was sweating and looked as if [From.GetSheHe] would faint at any time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3675;You must help me!' the courtier said, 'I need a poem for my sweetheart and I have no time to write it myself. Can you please help me?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3676;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gave a piece of paper to one of the courtiers, who gave [From.GetHerHim] a kiss on the cheek before running of. Did my spouse [From.GetFirstName] just give a love poem to a courtier?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3677;I hadn't really thought about the implications of giving a love poem to a courtier, no matter what that courtier would do with it. My [From.GetFirstName] misunderstand and believed it to have more significance than it had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3680;I gave the poem to my sweetheart and [Root.GetSheHeOpp] read it slowly while I waited patiently for [Root.GetHerHisOpp] reaction. The poem was lovely and my only regret was that I hadn't written it myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3681;It took me a while to realize the poem everyone talked about was one of mine, [From.GetTitledFirstName] had mislead everyone and managed to seduce someone with the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3682;[From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about me telling people I had written the poem and I told [From.GetHerHim] I hadn't exactly told anyone I had written the poem. People had just assumed that because I had given the love poem to my sweetheart I had written it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3683;I landed face first in the mud that covered the cell floor and tried to get up before the door closed. 'I did not give you that poem so you could go around seducing people with the help of it!', [From.GetTitledFirstName] snarled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3685;No matter how hard I try, I cannot think of anything that rhymes with orange! I must have lost my muse, my inspiration is absolutely gone. Oh woe is me, what shall I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3686;A muse is something more than just inspiration, you must learn to love and cherish your muse or else [Root.GetSheHeOpp] will leave you and take the inspiration with [Root.GetHerHimOpp]. I found my muse when I set my eyes upon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3687;Your eyes are... are like the sea a rainy day!' [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me and scribbled furiously with [From.GetHerHis] quill on the already ink stained paper.\n'You are my inspiration, my muse. I will cherish our love forever!' [From.GetTitledFirstName] added after finishing 'the greatest poem ever! For now, at least'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3688;My new muse [From.GetTitledFirstName] almost makes my quills burn with all the poems that want to be released unto paper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3689;No matter how many poems I wrote for [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] just scowled at me and claims I 'disgust [From.GetHerHim]'. I feel my inspiration run short for every rejection and I have to admit to myself: [From.GetTitledFirstName] is not the muse I am looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3690;I had just mounted my horse and was reaching for my bird when [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] asked me to bring one of our children with me on the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3691;I saddled my horse as fast as I could, not wanting to wait for the clumsy stable boy to do it, and took my bird from the falconer. My [GetFromRelation] smiled at me and then gave the signal to let the hunt begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3692;I galloped to catch up with the hunting party but when I saw my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] frown at me, clearly upset with me joining the hunting party, I almost turned my horse around and galloped back to the castle. Why was I told [From.GetFirstName] wanted me to join [From.GetHerHis] hunting party when [From.GetSheHe] didn't want me there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3693;It was a great day for falconing, the sky was blue and the game was plentiful. My child [From.GetTitledFirstName], although maybe a bit unused to having to gut and skin the hunted prey, did very well and [From.GetSheHe] did not complain once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3694;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to gut and skin the hunted prey the falcon brought, and it was pure luck my huntsman managed to grab the bird when [From.GetSheHe] panicked and let go of the tethers when the bird tried to fly off. The day went from bad to worse and I was not very happy when we got back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3695;The wager [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I agreed on was that the one who managed to catch the most prey wouldn't need to gut and skin any of it. I lost and, although I usually would rather not spend a whole hour gutting and skinning hares, this time I was too proud of [From.GetTitledFirstName] to really care about the slimy, gut-wrenching feel of intestines sliding through my hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3696;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was more interested in flowers and herbs than the prey the birds hunted. When it was time to skin and gut the hares [From.GetHerHis] face literally went green and we had to stand back when [From.GetSheHe] lost [From.GetHerHis] lunch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3697;I had a lovely day hunting with my birds, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and one of our children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3698;[From.GetTitledFirstName], although already in the saddle and with a bird perched on the pommel of the saddle, chose to leave the hunting party and ride back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3700;'Would you mind helping me with my new hunting bird?'\n\nI was asked to take a look and maybe help train a new falcon for a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3701;The falcon was easy to train and it didn't take long before I could take it out hunting without fearing it would try to escape or make a messy kill of its prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3702;No matter what I did, the falcon was hard to train and did not respond in the same way as the birds I kept myself. I was already prepared to give up when something frightened the bird and it attacked me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3703;I had put down many hours training my friend's falcon, and how was I rewarded? By my friend taking credit for the well-trained falcon and bragging about how easy it was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3704;[From.GetTitledFirstName] offered to buy the falcon [From.GetSheHe] had deemed useless and I was happy to get rid of it. Now, a couple of weeks later I understand [From.GetTitledFirstName] lied to me: the bird wasn't useless, [From.GetSheHe] only wanted me to sell it cheap to [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3705;The falcon managed to wound [From.GetTitledFirstName] when [From.GetSheHe] tried to train it and apparently confirmed [From.GetHerHis] suspicion that the bird was useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3706;[From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me train my new falcon and was not glad when I started bragging to other people about how easy it had been to train the bird. [From.GetSheHeCap] confronted me and told me [From.GetSheHe] would never help me train another bird, ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3707;I watched with awe when [From.GetTitledFirstName] released my falcon and it swooped down from the sky, killing the hare almost immediately. Despite the fact that [From.GetSheHe] had never trained a falcon before, it hadn't taken long before the falcon was a well-trained death machine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3710;It hasn't escaped me that a vassal of mine does not like nor support me. My decisions are scoffed at, my suggestions ignored and the vassal takes any chance to show how little I matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3711;I had done my best to show [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I do not like nor want to support [From.GetHerHim]. Finally, [From.GetTitledFirstName] realized this and talked to me about my problem with [From.GetHerHim], trying to win my support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3712;We talked and talked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I, trying to resolve our issues with each other. I thought I had gotten through to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] told me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3715;My child is not gregarious like me, whenever I see someone I don't know I always take the chance to talk to them but my child is shy and would rather hide or disappear through the ground when someone tries to strike up a conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3720;I don't usually like gossip but I couldn't help agree with the gossiper. That proud courtier sure needs to get a grip on reality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3721;People are gossiping about you and your pride,' [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me and then continued talking about 'the sin of pride' and how I should 'mend my ways'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3722;After I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] about the gossip about [From.GetHerHim], I had to wait a while for [From.GetHerHis] reaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3725;I'd like to think of myself as a magnanimous person but I have started to feel uneasy while talking to servants. The courtiers clearly do not find it fitting for a [Root.GetTitle] to consort with the servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3730;The clumsy servant once again managed to cover me in chicken bones, rice and oil and I lost my temper, knocking the servant to the floor in a clatter of broken crockery. My wroth had once again gotten the best of me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3731;It was not the first time the servant managed to spill food and dirty crockery on [From.GetTitledFirstName] and the furious [From.GetManWoman] sent the servant to the floor with a mighty slap, threatening to hang the servant's head from the castle wall if he ever did it again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3732;When the servant finally came to and started collecting the broken crockery, [From.GetTitledFirstName] couldn't help but comment on what had transpired before [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently, I was not to chastise my own servants, not even when they shamed me in front of guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3733;'You did right, chastising your clumsy servant like this. From now on, he will certainly be more careful if he do not wish to have his head hung up on the castle walls!'\n[From.GetTitledFirstName] spoke approvingly of me punishing the servant for spilling food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3735;Everyone else ran off to chase the alleged thieves who had stolen the zakat, the money we all had contributed to give to those less fortunate, from our mosque. Instead of following them, I searched through the mosque and discovered the zakat hidden in a niche no one else had thought to look in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3736;All but [From.GetTitledFirstName] chased after the alleged thieves and I thought [From.GetSheHe] to be a coward. When we finally got back to the mosque, without the zakat, the money collected to help the poor, [From.GetTitledFirstName] triumphantly told us it had been hidden in a niche inside the mosque all along...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3737;I had not really expected anyone to truly care about the missing zakat, at the time it seemed more like an excuse to make as much noise and tumult as possible. I was proven wrong when [From.GetTitledFirstName] shook my hand and thanked me for finding the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3740;I was one of the first to saddle my horse and chase after the bandits who had stolen the zakat, the money collected to help the poor, from our mosque. When I returned, exhausted and with filthy clothes, I was told the old imam had simply misplaced the zakat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3745;I am content with praying five times a day in my own home but the imam scolds me if I do not show up at least once a day at the mosque for prayers and tells me I should set a better example for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3750;There's always something to do in the mosque. The more time I spend there, the more I appreciate the calm and I feel more connected to Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3751;Ever since [From.GetTitledFirstName] became engaged in the mosque's different activities, or, rather, started following every order from the imam and wasting time, [From.GetSheHe] has stopped spending time with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3752;I have had little time for [From.GetTitledFirstName] since I became engaged in the mosque's different activities and [From.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy with me neglecting [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3755;I try to follow the five pillars of Islam as best I can, and zakat is one of the most important and best ways to show my commitment to the faith. The few gold coins exacted from me to help the poor in form of zakat is most vital to eliminate inequality and make the world a better place for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA3000;Lie to my confessor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3001;I will not visit that brothel again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3005;I will fight, and I will win, for your honor must be protected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3010;I wish I could ignore [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3011;Please God, forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3012;Spend time and money investigating the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3013;Scold our host for his sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3020;This is a sign that I should be celibate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3021;Take him into our service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3022;This is good advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3025;I will not give in to temptation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3026;God, have mercy on my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3030;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3035;Pay someone to spread stories about my manliness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3040;We had a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3045;Everyone told me it had been a fantastic night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3046;[From.GetSheHeCap] is my best friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3047;A new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3050;Do they laugh at me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3055;They all resent me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3056;[From.GetSheHeCap] disgusts me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3057;That is hurtful! Why would you tell me this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3060;Shiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3065;I won more than I lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3070;Anyone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3071;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3072;We hunted in my forest, I should get more than you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3075;Is this really necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3080;Talk to a courtier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3081;Visit one of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3082;I can let them stay in one of my castles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3083;It is a duty to their eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3084;I bow my head in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3085;Giving mercy is a virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3095;It was just enough for something to eat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3096;[This.GetSheHeCap] wastes [This.GetHerHis] fortune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3097;So?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3100;It works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3105;Work smarter, not harder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3110;This is inexcusable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3115;I don't think [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] minds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3116;[From.GetSheHeCap] will burn in everlasting hellfire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3117;Ignore [From.GetHerHim]....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3120;Show [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] my good deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3121;Be an example to my vassals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3122;I will do whatever it takes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3123;It was a lot of talk, but well worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3124;Reduce the costs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3125;More soldiers is the goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3126;May God have mercy on my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3140;Insult one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3141;Insult one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3142;Insult one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3143;Insult one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3144;Insult one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3145;Tell one of them how fat she is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3160;Some courtiers think it's good, too;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3161;I'm proud of [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3162;Thank you for those kind words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3165;It is truly rewarding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3170;Of course! Take whatever you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3175;I hope the courtier listened and understood me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3176;That's preposterous and I told [From.GetHerHim] that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3177;That's... unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3180;Although, they seldom do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3185;I just hope this works out fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3186;[From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3187;I made him pay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3190;How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3191;How wrothful [From.GetSheHe] is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3192;No point of explaining, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3193;Yes, that was what I thought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3195;All hell is loose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3200;Reason with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3201;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3202;Eat less food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3203;I will forgive my vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3204;Thank God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3205;Pray with the sinner in the chapel tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3206;Join [From.GetTitledFirstName] in prayer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3207;Non nobis..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3208;My God have mercy on [From.GetHerHis] soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3220;Pride is not a sin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3225;But... it's a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3226;I hope this will keep [From.GetHerHim] happy and occupied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3227;I will start working on it immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3230;Crazy [Root.job_spiritual.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3235;Who dares laughing at me? Who!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3236;[From.GetSheHeCap] hurt my pride, too;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3237;I do not need [From.GetHerHis] advice anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3240;Submit to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3241;Good News!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3242;Submit to the Throne of St. Peter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3243;Honor [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHim] for [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] skill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3244;Thank you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3245;Reward my [Root.GetMyChancellorName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3246;Reward my [Root.GetMySpymasterName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3247;Reward my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3248;Reward my Steward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3258;I must be humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3260;Talk the talk and Talk the talk..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3261;Talk the talk and Talk the talk..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3262;They serve me after all..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3263;Talk the talk and Talk the talk..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3280;Speak my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3281;I don't like [From.GetHerHim] anymore..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3282;I should be more of a diplomat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3283;Praise [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] publicly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3284;Oh well..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3285;This was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3300;I fainted when I saw the boar's face covered with bloody froth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3305;The priest is getting old;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3306;The priest had just misplaced the chalice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3307;Well... ehum... it was nothing, really;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3310;That, however, is not suitable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3315;I think someone heard me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3316;What a coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3320;Enough with your nagging! You can come along;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3321;My hero!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3322;I could not save everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3325;He appreciated my effort, at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3330;They were too many...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3335;I fear for [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3336;But it's such a thrill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3340;I think I lost his respect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3345;I didn't dare tell him that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3346;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3347;[From.GetSheHeCap] seemed to like me anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3350;The shame! Oh, the shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3355;My shyness cripples me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3356;I am not that scary, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3357;What a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3360;Gold! Diamonds! Ore! Eh, wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3365;Could they be any more envious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3366;I want that too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3367;I'll teach you but I gotta charge you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3370;He said 'yes'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3375;It is for both our best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3376;Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3377;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s got a green-eyed monster on [From.GetHerHis] shoulder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3378;I give myself a pat on the back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3380;I am content;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3381;Let me stay here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3382;[From.GetTitledFirstName] felt less stressed afterwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3385;He will ruin everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3390;It's not that expensive after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3395;I'm content with my life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3396;Lazy good-for-nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3397;Leave me alone, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3400;Who knew being arbitrary could be good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3405;It saved me, but only for a minute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3406;[From.GetSheHeCap] is too arbitrary to voice [From.GetHerHis] own opinion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3407;The priest thought it to be unfair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3408;It seems like I've got an admirer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3410;I lost too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3411;This is my court, I may be as arbitrary as I wish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3412;[From.GetSheHeCap] is too arbitrary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks I am a bad person for ruling so arbitrary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3415;It's how it should be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3416;That's horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3417;Who cares?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3418;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3420;I should interfere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3422;They still won't speak with each other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3425;He had it coming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3430;It was worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3435;The farmer is obviously lying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3436;Fine, I'll pay for the reparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3437;The farmer was obviously wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3438;Did [From.GetSheHe] really wish to pay for the reparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3440;I'm sorry but that cookie looked suspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3441;Stop it! Stop it, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3442;I hope that is enough, but probably not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3445;No way they will keep up with me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3450;Then I knew they all lied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3451;For example, I never lie... ehum...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3452;It could happen, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3455;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3476;A suitable punishment for an infidel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3547;Oh no! A history lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3460;Deus vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3461;It was the right thing to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3462;Thank you, I really needed that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3465;If I had known this sooner...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3470;Is there anything else I can do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3471;I feel neglected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3472;Why do you always complain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3475;Thinner wallet but thicker soul...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3480;I think I have found the culprits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3481;At least [From.GetSheHe] calmed down a bit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3482;I forgave them, even though it was hard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3485;I have never found the arrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3490;Are you trying to poison me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3491;I had enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3492;I did apologise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3495;Avoid open spaces, they are dangerous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3500;But he was wrong, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3505;Show me the bridge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3506;That was scary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3507;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3510;Bad, bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3515;It did not end well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3516;[From.GetSheHeCap] will kill me for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3517;I will never see her again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3520;I won't give in to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] temptations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3521;Maybe I should try it [From.GetHerHis] way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3525;Maybe tomorrow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3526;I should talk to [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3527;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me and left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3530;He deserves it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3530_2;I should be a good [Root.Religion.GetName] and help him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3531;Not one more time!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3532;Embarrassed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3535;I will join them and my sins will be forgiven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3536;I deserve this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3537;What an admirable [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3538;[From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I'm admirable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3540;Demand that [my_courtier.GetSheHe]'ll teach me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3541;[From.GetSheHeCap] demands that I teach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3542;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3543;Someone to talk books with!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3544;Go away, you tiresome [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3545;I think I got through to [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3546;History it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3548;My [GetFromRelation] was apparently embarrassed by my choice of bedtime story;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3550;Maybe I should relocate some of the books to our bedchamber?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3551;Books everywhere! Do not want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3552;Someone has to stop [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3553;I just love books;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3555;My [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3556;It's truly beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3557;I'm glad [From.GetSheHe] likes it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3558;I don't think [From.GetSheHe] liked the rose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3559;I have had enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3560;I shall have the secrets of the garden!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3561;And now [From.GetTitledFirstName] demands I tell my secret!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3562;Will my vegetables and flowers stink as much as this muck?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3563;I hope my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will love the rose, too;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3564;I must make sure [From.GetSheHe] doesn't spend all our money on such frivolous things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3565;It's such a frivolous thing to spend money on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3566;It's my garden and I'll do what I want with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3567;It's my money and I'll do what I want with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3568;Might be easier to remove it if I ask someone to help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3569;It looks rather harmless. I'll help you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3570;I demand help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3571;[From.GetSheHeCap] demands that I help [From.GetHerHim] obtain the book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3572;The book is finally mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3575;I will keep nagging until I get in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3576;I will scare [From.GetHerHim] away with a dangerous initiation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3577;Okay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3578;Okay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3579;[From.GetSheHeCap] made an excellent love potion! It even worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3580;I'm a proud member of 'The Esoteric [Root.Religion.GetName]'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3581;I failed the initiation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3585;Nah, I start fiddling with it at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3586;Careful now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3587;What will [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] say when [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] sees my face?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3588;Gold! I have created gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3590;Here goes nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3591;I think I am crazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3592;It worked! It actually worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3593;I want to test it on someone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3594;Let me try it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3595;The concoction made [From.GetTitledFirstName] mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3596;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3597;This is all my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3600;I must have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3601;Destroy it! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3602;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3603;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3604;[From.GetSheHeCap] decided to sell it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3605;You shall teach me this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3606;The nerve! [From.GetSheHe] demanded that I taught [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3607;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3610;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3611;I confess, please don't do that to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3612;I almost felt disappointed when [From.GetTitledFirstName] confessed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3615;I hope the child will follow in my footsteps!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3616;Of course! Do I get to use the brazen bull on someone then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3617;I am so proud of you, my [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3618;That honestly hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3620;The greatest second will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3621;[From.GetSheHeCap] demand that I'll be [From.GetHerHis] second!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3622;Thank you anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3625;Do you dare accept this challenge to a duel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3626;I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3627;Bow before your better, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3628;You bastards! Release me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3629;I wanted a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3630;Of course, not everyone agrees with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3631;I should ask [From.GetHerHim] to stop duelling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3632;This has to end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3633;Give up the one thing I live for? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3635;Fine! You may choose weapon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3636;A moorish cannon, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3637;If that's what [From.GetSheHe] want to use...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3638;It sounds disgusting but if that what [From.GetSheHe] choose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3639;Swords is fine by me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3640;The best hunter must help me fill the empty place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3641;Somehow, [From.GetSheHe] found me and now demands my help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3642;The head looks great above the fireplace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3645;I should invite my [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3646;If it pleases my [From.GetLordLady], then I'll join you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3647;I'd love to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3648;It was a great hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3649;I'm still disappointed, though;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3650;My marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] should be able to deal with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3651;You'll be dead soon, pig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3652;The boar fought bravely but we killed him at the end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3653;[From.GetTitledFirstName] had paid a professional hunter to kill the boar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3654;Do I have to do everything myself?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3655;My [Root.GetMyChancellorName], [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName], is scared of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3656;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a bloody idiot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3657;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not impressed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3660;Poet, make this piece of poetry better, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3661;It was irritating when [From.GetSheHe] demanded my help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3662;I couldn't have done it without you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3665;This is a poem about courtly love... *ahem*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3670;None of us were harmed but the bees wasn't happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3671;Coward! It's your fault if the bees sting me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3675;Of course! What kind do you want? An ode, a sonnet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3676;It probably does not mean anything;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3677;Honey, the poem was for the courtier's sweetheart, no one else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3680;[Root.GetSheHeCapOpp] kissed me when [Root.GetSheHeOpp] had read 'my' poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3681;Confront [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3682;I'm sorry, but I would do it again if I could!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3683;Is this about your daughter? I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3685;I will find a new muse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3686;...a courtier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3687;Well thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3688;Keep my inspiration flowing and I'll love you forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3689;I'll have to find inspiration from somewhere else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3690;Yes, yes. Just hurry up, I'm eager to hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3691;Let's go hunt some hares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3692;I ignore [From.GetHerHim] and try to think on the hunt only;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3693;I think it was good for both of us to do this together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3694;This was shameful! How could you disappoint me like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3695;I am impressed! No one has ever killed so many hares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3696;[From.GetTitledFirstName], you have to get used to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3697;We will do this again, soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3698;Why did [From.GetSheHe] do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3700;I lie and tell my friend it is useless, then offer to buy it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3701;I should keep it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3702;I have to tell my friend this bird cannot be trained;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3703;To the prison with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3704;You lied to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3705;That's too bad. I have to put it down then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3706;What, never again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3707;Thank you so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3710;I'll charm the vassal with my brilliant wits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3711;I don't change my mind that easily!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3712;...that I will never have [From.GetHerHis] support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3715;Show my child how great it is to talk to people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3720;I'll talk to the courtier about the gossip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3721;I don't know what you are talking about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3722;[From.GetSheHeCap] didn't know what I was talking about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3725;To hell with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3730;Next time, your head will hang from the castle walls!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3731;You should not treat your servants like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3732;Don't you tell me what I might or might not do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3733;Glad I have your approval...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3735;The imam is getting old;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3736;My thoughts were shameful, forgive me for thinking them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3737;Now the money can help the poor, that's all I ever wanted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3745;I will try, may Allah be my witness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3750;Let me know if more help is needed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3751;Wife, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3752;I'm sorry, but it makes me happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3755;I gladly give this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB3000;Confess and Pray;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3005;My wife is my Honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3012;Let the Church decide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3013;Keep quiet, and pray God will forgive our sin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3020;Does the Pope think I will grant him my lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3021;Thank him for his advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3022;Foolish advice that I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3025;God, please save my soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3026;Push the woman away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3035;Bed a wench publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3040;But my guests had to pay to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3060;And some fool had just given him the money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3070;I'll just wait until my friend is better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3075;Attempt to steal some from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3080;Talk to a vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3081;Help one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3082;There is just no place for them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3083;I don't want to upset them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3085;I can not follow those teachings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3096;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a good example to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3097;Maybe I should be less charitable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3100;I don't even have time for church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3105;It makes my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] happier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3110;Make an effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3120;Bend my knee to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3121;Talk about feudal obligations to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3122;Sounds like too much work for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3124;Reduce the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3125;The morale of my retinue is the most important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3126;Virtues are not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3140;Befriend one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3141;Befriend one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3142;Befriend one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3143;Befriend one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3144;Befriend one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3145;Befriend one of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3170;Refuse to help them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3191;That priest deserved it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3200;Listen to them patiently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3201;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3202;Drink less wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3203;I will keep my grudge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3205;Pray alone for their soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3206;Refuse [From.GetHerHis] request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3220;Pride comes before a fall...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3240;I will never bend my knee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3242;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3243;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for [Root.GetMyMarshalName] [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3245;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3246;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for [Root.GetMySpymasterName] [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3247;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3248;Thank God for my Steward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3258;Ambitions are more important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3260;Let [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] get the blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3261;Let [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] get the hard work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3262;Let [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] get the blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3263;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3280;Keep quiet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3282;Honesty be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3283;Send a private letter to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3315;My soldiers will not respect me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3320;There is no way you'll join us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3322;...but I managed to save [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3335;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will be fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3375;I don't need to do this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3376;It is for my own good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3381;I feel less stressed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3406;It was a bit flattering, really;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3412;[From.GetTitledFirstName] must be wiser than me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thought my judgement to be wiser than [From.GetSheHe] could understand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3416;I have no problem with that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3435;The farmer should be compensated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3436;[From.GetTitledFirstName] made me pay for the damages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3437;[From.GetSheHeCap] was happy to pay for the reparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3438;[From.GetSheHeCap] should just pay for the reparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3470;I want to stay here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3485;It was YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3495;Accuse everyone publicly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3520;Okay, but just for one night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3521;This isn't my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3525;...or ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3526;Maybe I should live a little before making this decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3530;His sins are his own, no one can help him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3532;Indifferent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3535;Isn't there a less painful way to be forgiven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3537;That's idiotic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3538;[From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I'm an idiot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3540;Ask nicely if [my_courtier.GetSheHe] could teach me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3541;[From.GetSheHeCap] asked nicely if I could teach [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3543;I should leave the courtier alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3544;I didn't know [From.GetSheHe] liked books! That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3545;[From.GetSheHeCap] was as polite but aloof as always;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3546;No stories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3547;Myths and legends? What am I, five?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3548;[From.GetSheHeCap] loved the bedtime story!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3550;I do feel I have enough books now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3551;Let [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3552;Time to pack my bags, I guess;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3553;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] help me! I do have a problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3555;That pretty little thing might like the rose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3556;A rose? I want jewellery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3559;Why didn't [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] give the rose to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3560;My garden is wilting before my eyes! Please help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3561;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me what my secret was;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3563;No... it's too much money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3564;If it makes [From.GetHerHim] happy, I should encourage it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3565;Why should I care?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3566;Fine! I won't buy any more expensive plants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3567;Yes, I know and I won't do it again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3568;I'll ask my child to help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3569;This is as close as I'll get to that monstrosity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3570;I'm asking nicely about help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3571;[From.GetSheHeCap] asked nicely if I could help [From.GetHerHim] obtain the book;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3575;The group is not for the pious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3576;A skill-based initiation should scare [From.GetHerHim] away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3577;It sounds too dangerous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3578;No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3579;Still, I won't let [From.GetHerHim] become a member;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3585;Read up on alchemy first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3587;My eyebrows!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3590;I throw the potion away. I trust [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will cure me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3591;Is this lunacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3593;My child is sick, the potion might cure it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3594;I don't dare try it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3600;It's too terrifying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3601;It is... impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3602;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3604;[From.GetSheHeCap] decided to keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3605;Would you please teach me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3606;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me nicely if I could teach [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3610;A great opportunity to test the brazen bull!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3611;I won't say a word!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3612;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to confess! Sharpen my tools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3615;...or maybe we should share a less bloody interest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3616;That's horrible! No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3620;I will ask the greatest second if he's willing to help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3621;I could not say no when [From.GetSheHe] asked so nicely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3625;I'm sorry! I don't want to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3626;There would be no honor in defeating you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3630;I have tired of this. Next time, I won't accept the challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3631;I shouldn't interfere, the duelling makes [From.GetHerHim] happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3632;[From.GetSheHeCap] is happy, why should I interfere?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3633;Fine, but just for a year, okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3635;Please don't hit me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3636;A forkful of animal excrement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3637;What kind of foolishness is this?! I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3638;I will not touch animal excrement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3639;I changed my mind, I won't fight you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3640;Please, I need the best hunter alive to help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3641;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked if I could help [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3645;I should invite my [Root.GetMyChancellorName], [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3646;There is too many things I need to get done, my [From.GetLordLady];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3647;Ask me another time, I'm busy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3650;My spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] should be able to deal with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3651;I'm out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3652;No one will think less of me if I hire someone to do this, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3653;[From.GetTitledFirstName] returned unharmed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3654;Take that useless [From.GetManWoman] away from my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3655;My Marshal, [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], is scared of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3656;[From.GetTitledFirstName] scared me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3657;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was really scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3660;Poet, could you please help me? This piece of poetry is rubbish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3661;It was flattering when [From.GetSheHe] humbly asked for my help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3665;I think this poem about a sinful character will be entertaining...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3670;The bees managed to sting [From.GetTitledFirstName] several times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3675;For a small sum I would be happy to provide you with a love poem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3676;Why do I never get poems from [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3677;Do these earrings prove my love for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3680;I had to tell [Root.GetHerHim] wherefrom I got the poem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3681;[From.GetSheHeCap] seduced my little girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3683;I did not seduce your wife, she threw herself at me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3685;My inspiration is gone, possibly forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3686;...my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3687;You disgust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3690;Do I really have to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3691;Wait, I am not ready for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3692;I'd better turn around, [From.GetSheHe] will be relived when I'm not around;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3700;For a coin or two I might be able to help you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3701;I will train it some more and then sell it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3702;Before I knew it, I managed to kill the falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3703;Let my friend brag, I do not care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3704;[From.GetTitledFirstName] then sold the 'useless' bird with profit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3705;[From.GetTitledFirstName] killed the bird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3710;Too bad for the vassal I'm the one who rules here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3711;I relent, you have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3712;...that [From.GetSheHe] will support me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3715;The world is a dangerous place and my child knows it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3720;I don't want to upset anyone, I'll keep quiet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3721;Help me free myself from my vices!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3722;[From.GetSheHeCap] asked me to help [From.GetHerHim] be free of this vice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3725;Fine! I'll stop talking to the servants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3731;Your servant will certainly be more careful from now on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3750;Let me stay here, forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3751;Husband, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC3005;I do not dare fight though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3012;The land belongs to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3020;Dedicate a mass to chastity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3035;Declare my love for my Wife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3126;May Allah have mercy on my soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3140;Attempt to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3141;Attempt to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3142;Attempt to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3143;Attempt to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3144;Attempt to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3145;Try to look more attractive to my man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3202;Abstain from my vices;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3436;[From.GetTitledFirstName] judged in my favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3520;Who am I kidding? I can't resist [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3525;I only do it because I fear God's wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3532;Humbled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3540;Bribe the courtier into teaching me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3541;[From.GetSheHeCap] bribed me to teach [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3546;Fantasy it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3547;Wonderful! A history lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3550;If I remove this wall I could get plenty more space for my books;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3555;I will keep it for myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3559;It hurts, but [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] didn't intend it to be a token of love. I hope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3560;I will buy the secret from the courtier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3561;[From.GetSheHeCap] was so desperate [From.GetSheHe] paid me to reveal my secret;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3563;It will look divine among the other roses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3568;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] can help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3570;I will bribe someone to help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3571;[From.GetSheHeCap] bribed me to help [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3576;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] will tire and stop inquiring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3585;I should be careful. I still remember what happened to my uncle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3590;A real doctor should be able to make me better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3593;My spouse [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is sick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3601;I hope [From.GetSheHe] won't use it on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3602;Because it's you who asks, I'll get rid of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3605;Fine! Then you can handle the torturing for now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3606;I will never reveal the secret torture methods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3610;What is wrong with me? This isn't who I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3611;No, no, not the brazen bull!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3620;For some gold he'll be willing to be my second!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3621;A couple of gold coins and I agreed to be [From.GetHerHis] second;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3625;Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], take care of this duel for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3636;With swords;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3640;If it is gold you want I'll give you gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3641;[From.GetTitledFirstName] promised gold to anyone who would help [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3645;I should invite my [Root.GetSpymasterName], [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3650;I will kill it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3651;I'd rather hire a professional hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3653;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lost a limb to the beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3654;Now I have to pay a real hunter for this simple task!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3655;My Steward, [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName], is scared of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3656;Did you really try to scare me, [From.GetTitledFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3657;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was angry at me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3660;The sweet sound of money should make him eager to help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3661;Who can resist the sweet sound of gold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3665;The life of a saint is always good material for poetry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3670;The bee sting made [From.GetTitledFirstName] ill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3675;You should give your sweetheart a poem of your own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3681;[From.GetSheHeCap] seduced my wife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3685;I... just... have to work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3686;No... I cannot live with [Root.GetHerHimOpp] as my muse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3690;I don't want to, and you can't make me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3700;The bird will be easy to train;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3701;The owner will be glad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3702;My friend has to take it back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3703;How could my friend do this to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3705;The useless bird was killed by [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3715;I'll leave my shy child alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3720;It is not nice to talk about people behind their back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3725;What the courtiers don't know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3751;Father, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD3020;Thank God quietly in the chapel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3436;I was prepared to pay for the damages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3540;I am knowledgeable enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3547;Myths and legends, my favorite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3550;I'll sell those books I've already read;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3560;No! I will save my garden myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3568;I'll do it myself. This might hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3570;I don't think anyone wants to help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3593;I don't dare let anyone try it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3605;Look, I'll give you lots of gold if you teach me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3606;The gold [From.GetSheHe] gave me will give [From.GetHerHim] the knowledge [From.GetSheHe] desires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3611;Not even the brazen bull can make me confess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3620;I have no need for a second!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3640;I will find the white hart someday...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3645;Maybe one of my children wants to join us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3650;I'll ask my son to take care of the boar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3653;The boar wounded [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3655;My Spymaster, [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName], is scared of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3660;I don't want him to think less of me as a poet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3665;You wouldn't appreciate my poems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3681;Forgive [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3690;Why don't you both join me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3700;I'll show you all my tricks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3702;I will wring your neck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3705;[From.GetTitledFirstName] forced me to take the bird back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3751;Mother, why do you neglect me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE3645;I should invite my [Root.GetTreasurerName], [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE3655;My [Root.GetLordSpiritualName], [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName], is scared of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF3645;I should invite my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName], [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF3655;A child of mine is afraid of the Wild Hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP3010;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is pardoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3046;Some wanted to congratulate me in person;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3047;I hope [From.GetSheHe] knows that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3056;Especially my courtiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3057;I better let [This.GetHerHim] know that gluttony is not attractive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3071;[This.GetTitledFirstName] willingly joins [Root.GetTitledFirstName] for the hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3072;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] should know I will not tolerate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3096;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] reacts to the alms given;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3097;I should tell [This.GetHerHim] how I feel about [This.GetHerHis] generosity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
