EVTDESC65000;The pressure of commanding a whole unit is killing me. The ones I have to command are lazy good-for-nothing soldiers but I had endured their incompetence until one of them managed to lose my horse's bridle and saddle. That was the last drop, then I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65001;I have always been bad at diplomacy and I fear I will insult the ambassador when he arrives to talk about a possible alliance between me and his liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65002;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] took me aside a couple of days before the ambassador was supposed to arrive and asked me to handle the negotiations, I was not exactly surprised. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has many virtues, but diplomacy is not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65003;As I have difficulty distinguishing the handle from the blade of a sword, I would rather delegate the troublesome task of handling the troops to my Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65004;It feels good that [From.GetTitledFirstName] trusts me enough to delegate the handling of [From.GetHerHis] troops to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65005;I have never been one to lurk in the shadows to plot and scheme, to plan assassinations or plant devious rumors about my rivals. I would gladly hand over those tasks to my Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65006;I have always felt a calling for plots and schemes, assassinations and devious rumors, all those shady activities that almost all participate in but never mentions. When I was entrusted with all this by [From.GetTitledFirstName] it was the happiest moment in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65007;Numbers eludes me, math frustrate me and taxes... don't even talk about taxes. Every time I try to understand and organize the expenses and revenues I get frustrated and feel inadequate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65008;I hadn't realized how much [From.GetTitledFirstName] had struggled with understanding and organizing the expenses and revenues so when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me to take over this task I was more than happy to relieve [From.GetHerHim] of [From.GetHerHis] burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65009;The [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s can be a bit irritable and after my latest blunder I feel the need to be extra careful around them. Too bad I cannot really rely on myself when I am stressed to be anything else but blunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65010;The more stressed [From.GetTitledFirstName] gets, the more blunt and outspoken [From.GetSheHe] becomes. There have been rumors about what happened the last time the [From.Religion.GetName] [From.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s visited us, and none of us who experienced the awkwardness and rage of [From.GetTitledFirstName] are keen to watch that happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65011;The stress and the frustration inside of me reached boiling point today when something important went fatally wrong. I lashed out in anger to hide my frustration and the anger went straight for the closest person,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65012;The anger in [From.GetFirstName]'s eyes frightened me and as [From.GetSheHe] poured [From.GetHerHis] anger and frustration on me, instead of addressing what really troubled [From.GetHerHim], I stood quietly and let [From.GetFirstName] get it out of [From.GetHerHis] system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65020;My fosterling is a weakling without any backbone! I would truly feel ashamed of myself if I couldn't do something to make the child less of a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65021;I was bored until I remembered the prisoner in my dungeons. I had so many deliciously cruel ideas as what to do to the prisoner, but I finally narrowed the ideas down to two: slowly reduce the food rationings or release rats in the prisoner's cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65022;We were high above the courtyard with courtiers scurrying around looking like ants. I ordered my bow and bow to be brought to me and started shooting at them, laughing at the panic and the looks they threw up at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65023;I do not tolerate any cravenness in my court, I despise the scared eyes of one of the courtiers and the way the courtier shy away from me and everything scary. There must be a way to cure the courtier of this cowardness, but how?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65030;Nothing feels good, nothing feels fun nor interesting. I am in the deepest, blackest pit of sorrow and worthlessness, feeling as I will never be able to escape from it and wondering why God makes us feel like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65031;The sickness is slowly eating away at me, making me look like a shadow of my former self. No matter what I do, no matter how many physicians I pay to cure me, nothing seems to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65032;My God, why have you forsaken me? I have been cursed with a fever, a headache from Hell and now I am coughing blood. I think [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] must have decided to punish me for my sins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65033;Jesus healed people like me, if I just was more devout and truly repented my sins He might heal me too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65034;The guilt is burning through me, every second is pure agony mixed with shame. I have never felt so guilty, so sinful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65035;I have written a religious tract which I named Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti [Root.GetFirstName], about a knight and how he journeyed through Purgatory and the Earthly Paradise. It is a masterpiece and I must share the tract with the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65036;I am not lustful, gluttonous, slothful, greedy, envious, proud or wroth. I am and will always be free from sin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65037;I secretly admire a person who has been celibate for many years now. I am a faithful [Root.Religion.GetName] and I have contemplated becoming celibate, but there has always been something that has hindered me from following that path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65040;My servants have provided such a fine meal today. There is an enormous amount of fine wine, and the cooking is absolutely great. I will enjoy this feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65041;Commanding troops is a demanding task, especially for someone as stressed as I am. There are ways though to relieve this stress, but how will I find solace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65042;I attended a great party down at the village last night. I do not remember all the details, but I surely must have had a great time at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65043;I woke up with a terrible hangover this morning. Now the priest is talking with his boring voice again, and I keep falling asleep here in Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65044;It seems that I have embarrassed myself severely in front of my children. This is entirely due to by habit of drinking until I pass out, but I simply can not stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65045;My beloved spouse [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has noticed my constant drinking and is deeply concerned. [Root.Spouse.GetSheHeCap] is asking me to stop drinking and become responsible again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65046;My beloved spouse has saved me from the fate of drunkards. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] bless [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65047;My husband has dragged me down to his levels, and got me addicted to wine. I wish I had never married him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65048;The wine makes me such a good speaker. I can truly motivate people, and they become inspired from hearing me talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65049;I have wasted enough days in my life as a drunkard. I need to get my life in to better shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65050;I seem to drink myself into an early grave. There must be some way to stop drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65051;There is nothing but whine, or wine.. I've lost my mine, my mined mind..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65052;The troops I am commanding thinks I am craven, I haven't shown myself to them for several days because of my illness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65053;I am soon dead, if not of old age then of this illness. I worry about my sins, will God truly forgive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65054;God answered my prayers! I am cured of my illness and can atone for my sins before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65055;Why am I sick, [GetFromRelation], is [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] punishing me? I haven't done anything wrong, have I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65056;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is very sick. [From.GetSheHe] is delirious and have started asking if [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is punishing [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65057;The cold nights of January are strainful for my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65060;I haven't grown as much as the other children and people tell me I'm a 'dwarf'. The other children found out and are mocking me, calling me goblin and pretend to be afraid when I come near them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65061;Despite my small stature, I have gained the respect of my court. Until a Dwarf Troupe appeared at the castle gates and none of them were taller than I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65065;There's a dwarf at the court and, being the giant of a [Root.GetManWoman] that I am, people has been pestering me to test my strength by tossing the dwarf as far as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65066;Before I knew it, [From.GetTitledFirstName] picked me up and tossed me away! Luckily for me, I landed in a haystack head-first and was not hurt badly although my temper took a bad turn for the worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65070;I am usually so careful climbing down the narrow steps, what with my clubfoot making me clumsy and prone to fall down the stairs. Today, I wasn't as cautious as I should've been...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65071;I cannot run around playing with the other children as much as I like because of my clubfoot, and the other children has started making fun of me. They dart towards me, gives me a small push and then run away giggling and shouting 'Catch me if you can!'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65072;My clubfoot makes it hard for me to use a regular saddle, I need one with a custom-made stirrup that is big enough. Therefore I was much dismayed when someone had misplaced my special stirrup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65073;The new stirrup seemed to work fine, until my usually steady horse tried to throw me off by bucking and rearing. Finally it succeded, but because of the narrow stirrup my clubfoot got stuck and so I was dragged after the horse several yards before someone grabbed its reins and made it stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65074;I fear my clubfoot hinders me from getting married! As I am not as graceful as the other women at court, I'd rather not dance or do anything too exhausting that will cost me my balance and make me a laughing stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65080;I am teased for my harelip, the other children tells me my mother must have looked at a hare's split lip when she was pregnant with me and wished for me to look the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65081;I was talking to one of my vassals and was interrupted by a courtier. Trying to be courteous, I presented them to each other, only to mispronounce the vassal's name because of my harelip...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65085;I mostly play the monster whenever the other children let me play with them. They say my hunchback makes me the perfect person for the monster part, and even if it hurts when they say that I still get to play with them, and that is usually good enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65090;Who can love someone like me? The hunch on my back, my ugly face? I pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] every chance I get to find me someone to love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65091;I walked slowly, no thoughts in my mind when someone ran into me from behind. We fell to the ground together and I grabbed the young woman instinctively, ready to defend myself from her scorn. Instead, she looked pleadingly at me and asked me to help her flee from the guards who had harassed her since she arrived in [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65092;I managed to save Hope, as the young woman's name was, from the guards and we spent the next few days together. She did not seem to notice my hunchback, only the man I am before it. It startled me when I realized I had begun to love her, my Hope in love...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65095;People are laughing at me, saying that my hunchback makes me less of a [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65100;The other children ask me to say words, giggles when I try to pronounce them without lisping but always fails and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. Why are they so mean to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65101;During my conversation with a vassal I tried to lisp as little as possible, but when a courtier came up to us and wanted me to introduce [Root.GetHerHimOpp] to the vassal I could barely make myself understood when I tried to pronounce the vassal's name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65102;My lisp sometimes makes it hard for people to understand me, and when I become frustrated the lisp becomes worse, making it even harder to understand me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65105;The more upset I become, the more I stutter and the other children are well aware of this. Their taunting and pestering makes me sad but I cannot tell them that without stuttering which makes them laugh even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65106;I seldom stutter these days, unless I am upset, frustrated or excited. The more I try to force the words to leave my tongue the more I stutter and the more frustrated I get...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65107;I had managed to talk to speak to my vassal for several minutes without stuttering not even once! Then I got stuck on the vassal's name when I was supposed to present him to a courtier, not a word left my tongue. I had to let someone else present him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65110;tHe otHeR cHildReN aRe MeaN to Me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65115;I find tasty mud on ground. Eat some. While eat, young girl come to me. She ask, 'Are you stupid or something?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65120;Practise with sword on field today. Noticed hand was red when practise over. Held sword by wrong end whole time! Hahaha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65125;Horse strange today while riding. Head missing and only moved backwards. Rode this way into [Root.Location.GetName] where stable boy said, face other way, stupid! Did, and found horse head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65126;Forgot to put on pants this morning. Much shouting, many upset. I not understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65130;Today I stumbled upon a painting of the most wretched, hideous creature I had ever laid eyes on. This affront to nature left me chilled to the bone. The crooked teeth, the ears... [Root.GetHerHis] oversized nose alone was enough to make me nauseous! A nearby courtier then asked what I thought of my new portrait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65135;I learned today that mothers in [Root.Location.GetName] keep their daughters in line by threatening to marry them off to someone as hideous as... I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65140;Vicious rumors that I am a witch have been spreading in [Root.Location.GetName] due to my... unique appearance. At least my station prevents the peasants from acting on these baseless accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65145;As I grew up, those near me never made it a secret that I was a particularly ugly child. Now, as I am growing into a [Root.GetManWoman], they seem to react differently to my appearance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65150;Today as I mounted my favorite horse with the help of six stable boys, it let out a strange sigh and collapsed. The stable master claimed the horse was dead, its back broken. He hinted that perhaps it would be best for all concerned if I walk from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65151;Enough is enough. I have decided to eat less and exercise more. Why, I think I can finally see my feet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65155;I was touring the defenses of [Root.Location.GetName] and as I tried to enter one of the towers, I got stuck in the doorway! I found myself unable to move in either direction and it took the strength of four men to pull me free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65160;As I strolled through the streets of [Root.Location.GetName], I was approached by the local Coin Purse Inspector. He asked to see my purse, and I duly complied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65165;The wine from last night did not agree with me, I woke up with a terrible hangover this morning. Now the imam is chanting again, and I keep falling asleep during the sajdah here in the mosque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65170;You have mastered the art of desert warfare. This difficult terrain provides many obstacles for an army to overcome, but also great opportunities for those who know where to look for them. Your forces will always fight better in the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65171;Forests and hills have become your preferred battleground. Using them to your benefit, you are better able to safely close the distance to your opponents or keep your forces away as the situation dictates. Your troops will gain an important edge in this terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65172;You no longer see fighting in difficult mountainous terrain as a disadvantage, but as an opportunity. The movement of your army is easier to obscure, and your opponents can be funneled towards battlegrounds of your chosing. If battle is joined in the mountains, your army gains an advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC65173;Large, open battlefields are where you fight best. When fighting in plains or on farmland, you are better able to array your army for battle and maneuver it to gain an advantage. Forces under your command will perform better in this terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA65000;...screamed at them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65001;I should let my [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] take care of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65002;I am glad [From.GetTitledFirstName] feels [From.GetSheHe] can entrust me with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65003;I should definitely delegate that task to [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65004;I will not make [From.GetTitledFirstName] disappointed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65005;[Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] will make sure all plots will run smooth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65006;I will plot, I will scheme, and no one will know what hit them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65007;Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetFirstName], please help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65008;I will gladly help [From.GetTitledFirstName] with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65009;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] should be able to handle this better than I would;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65010;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me to take care of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65011;...[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65012;[From.GetFirstName]'s outburst of anger was uncalled for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65020;I'll try to beat some sense in the child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65021;Reduce food rations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65022;The next shot will be aimed low;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65023;Maybe if I pretend to push them off the walls?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65030;I must pray harder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65031;I should spend a fortnight fasting for my sins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65032;I should give to the poor for my sins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65033;Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65034;I ease my guilt with prayer and fasting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65035;The [Root.Religion.GetName] Church will help spread it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65036;I proclaim my lack of sin publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65037;I should ask [target_courtier.GetHerHim] for advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65040;Red red wine....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65041;Find solace in a bottle of wine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65042;I know I drank some wine..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65043;Keep on sleeping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65044;They will forget it eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65045;Force [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] to drink with you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65046;I am so lucky that I have [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65047;Curse him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65048;Talk to the commanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65049;Devoting myself to the sword will do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65050;But the wine tastes so good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65051;*slobber*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65052;Keep hiding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65053;Please give me more time God, I need to reform myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65054;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65055;God must be punishing me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65056;Yes, you are a sinner that deserves it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65057;If I need to be cured, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will cure me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65060;I will give them something to be afraid of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65061;I pity them, and refuse to have them perform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65065;Toss the dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65066;Are you insane or just an idiot?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65070;I landed at the bottom of the steps, badly hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65071;Next time, my fist will redecorate their faces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65072;Punish the stableboys;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65073;It must have looked laughable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65074;Despite my clubfoot, I should take any chance to dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65080;That's not true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65081;Shamed, I refuse to acknowledge the mispronunciation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65085;Not today, today I'll show you the real monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65090;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] has forsaken me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65091;Of course I'll help you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65092;This is true love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65095;Prove them wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65100;Let me be or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65101;Lisp? Me? No, you must be wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65102;I won't let this control my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65105;S-s-stop b-bothering me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65106;I'll practise and overcome this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65107;Of course I did it deliberately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65110;stUpid cHildReN...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65115;I smart. Girl stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65120;YOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65125;Oops. I done bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65126;Calm down! Simple mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65130;I need a mirror...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65135;I should spend more time indoors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65140;The wretches will soon find someone uglier to pester.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65145;An ugly duckling no longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65150;I may have put on some weight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65155;What have I become? No more suckling pig for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65160;Wait... that wasn't the Coin Purse Inspector...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65165;I can't... keep my... eyes... open...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65170;The sands will swallow my foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65171;The land shall be my greatest ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65172;The very mountains shall be my shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA65173;If caught in the open, my foes shall feel my wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB65000;...misplaced their food;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65001;No! I am the [Root.GetTitle], I should be able to handle this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65003;I should work harder on this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65005;I shouldn't rely too much on [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65007;I will fight the numbers and defeat them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65009;I will take care of them myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65011;...my heir [Root.Heir.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65020;I'll put the child out with the wolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65021;Release some rats in the prisoner's cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65022;I will aim high this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65023;I will scare the courtier in the middle of the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65030;I doubt myself and my faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65031;I will continue praying for a cure, or a miracle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65032;I believe prayers are enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65034;Pay church to ease some of my guilt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65035;I will give it to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] so [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] can help spread it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65036;I thank the Lord in private;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65040;Meat.... hmm..  meat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65041;Find solace in God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65043;This is not proper for a [This.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65045;Ignore [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65048;Talk to the common soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65049;Embroidery will take my mind off it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65050;I'll ask a priest for some advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65052;Mingle with the troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65053;God is punishing me rightly for my sins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65056;Don't worry, I'll take care of you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65057;Stay in a warm bed near the fire during the cold nights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65060;I won't give them the pleasure of seeing me cry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65061;I arrest their manager;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65065;Let the dwarf be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65071;I ignore them, hoping they will tire and go away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65072;Try to use a regular one;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65074;I ask my father to look for a suitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65080;I ignore them, their words hold no truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65081;I ask the vassal to forgive me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65085;I think I must accept my role...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65090;I shall pray some more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65091;Guards! Here she is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65092;But she cannot love someone like me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65095;They do not know me, so why should I care?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65100;I don't want to play with them anymore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65101;Forgive me, it's the lisp;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65102;I must learn to live with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65105;I'll hide from them so they will forget about me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65106;This is my everyday;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65107;I'm sorry, my stutter sometimes act up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65110;i leaVe Now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB65115;Stupid is as stupid does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# CleanSlate: No longer needed
# EVTDESC65166;The imams can be a bit irritable and after my latest blunder I feel the need to be extra careful around them. Too bad I cannot really rely on myself when I am stressed to be anything else but blunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC65167;The more stressed [From.GetTitledFirstName] gets, the more blunt and outspoken [From.GetSheHe] becomes. There have been rumors about what happened the last time the imams visited us, and none of us who experienced the awkwardness and rage of [From.GetTitledFirstName] are keen to watch that happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTB65037;I should ask the vassal for advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
