EVTNAME89501;The Voyages of Zheng He;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC89500;The Venetian merchant Marco Polo has finally returned to Europe after many years of travel in the Far East with his father and uncle. An account of their journey has been published as "The Travels of Marco Polo," describing, among other things, the distant lands of Cathay and Manji. Readers are provided a rare glimpse of the world beyond Europe, but there are those who discount the entire chronicle as a fabrication...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89501;A great fleet from the distant lands of China has appeared in the Arabian Sea. Commanded by the eunuch explorer Zheng He, or Hajji Mahmud Shamsuddin as he is known in Arabic, the fleet's colossal treasure ships are of a size never before seen in these waters. Despite its formidable strength, the expedition does not seem bent on conquest and will soon depart to explore other lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA89500;A stunning tale, nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89501;Safe journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
