EVTDESC_MNM_3202;My advisors inform me that [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] has been overheard questioning my loyalty to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When I summon [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHim], [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] is apologetic, but a raised eyebrow tells of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] doubt. "It's just a rumor, my [Root.GetLordLady]... You are not overly interested in [Root.GetReligiousRite], but you could surely quote any passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] without hesitation...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3204;As I began reciting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s eyes widened. I intentionally focused on what I believed to be [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] favorite passage, speaking clearly to [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] interests as a [stubborn_courtier.GetEducationRole]. My gambit seems to have paid off because the deep bow [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] bestowed upon me was nothing short of embarrassment and an eagerness to make up for [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] obvious blunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3205;As I rack my brain for the appropriate lines to shove triumphantly in [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s face, my palms grow sweaty.\n"Ezekiel 25:17! I will carry out great vengeance on them..." I begin. Then a slow panic begins to rise within my chest. [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] frowns. \n"No, wait, that doesn't seem right. That's not..." I mumble as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] shakes [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] head and with a roll of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] eyes walks away, leaving me alone with my failure. By the damnation of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], how did I get this so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3206;I make it clear to [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] that it seems almost heretical for someone supposedly well-versed in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to display such a poor understanding of the relationship between a ruler and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n[stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] clearly did not expect to have their own religious understanding challenged, and I try not to smile to myself as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] sputters an apology. As [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] prepares to leave, I remind [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHim] that many questions can be dangerous to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3207;My voice must not have sounded as threatening as I believed it to. When I told [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] how it could be dangerous to ask the wrong questions, [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] only laughed. As I followed up with stories of other unfortunate souls who had questioned their liege's faith, [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] grin remained. When [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] finally departed, it was with an even more disconcerting sentence. "I know exactly where my soul belongs, but I am unsure about yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3209;[concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] has come to me as a friend, to inquire about my wellbeing. "I feel as though I never see you pray anymore, is something heavy burdening your mind?" [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] asks.\nI think of my true beliefs, and how they need to be kept secret, even of those closest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3211;I regale [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] with tales of my "dark dreams" of strange and foreign rituals. [concerned_friend.GetSheHeCap] can barely believe the vividness with which I describe the faith of the unbelievers. Afterwards [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] offers me a listening ear for whenever I may be burdened like this again.\nIf only [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] knew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3212;As I describe my "dark dreams," [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName]'s expression grows ever more concerned. "You recall these dreams very well," [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] says. "Almost more like memories."\n[concerned_friend.GetFirstName] doesn't comment on it again, but later you worry that you may have made [concerned_friend.GetHerHim] more worried, not less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3213;I tried to reassure [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] that everything is as it should, and soon enough we were conversing and laughing like we used to. When the evening was over, [concerned_friend.GetFirstName] looked me in the eyes. "It is good to see that all is well with you after all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3214;I tried to reassure [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] that everything is as it should, but my mind would not stay still. Did they already know the truth about my faith? As our conversation drifted onto theology, I briskly told [concerned_friend.GetHerHim] that I had to retire for the evening. I barely said goodbye before I had them escorted out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3225_A;In an effort to convince the court of my piety, I have chosen to attend [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] and give a grand speech to my people, and to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] eyes me curiously as I enter the building, and I stop for moment to gather my thoughts. May [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, but I need to impress these people and choose my words carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3225_D;In an effort to convince the court of my piety, I have chosen to visit the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], and pray with the [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s.

EVTDESC_MNM_3225_N;In an effort to convince the court of my commitment to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I have gone to [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], and to visit the altar of God.

May [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, but I need to make a good impression here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3225_O;In an effort to convince my people of my commitment to the ancestors, I have come to make an offering at the sacred altar of our elders. A [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] eyes me warily as I walk the steps up to the temple. May [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, but I need to make a good impression here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3225_P;In an effort to convince the court of my piety, I have chosen to visit the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], and pray with the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s.

May [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, but I need to make a good impression here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_A;As I step up to the altar, people eye me carefully. They depend upon me, as [Root.GetTitle] and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods encouragingly at me, and I look up to study the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]. When I finally speak, I imagine that I am praising [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] – unsurprising, my words have never seemed more true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_D;As I step up to the altar, my people eye me carefully. They depend on their [Root.GetTitle], and [Root.GetHerHis] connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them.

EVTDESC_MNM_3226_E;As I step up in front of them, my people eye me carefully. They depend on their [Root.GetTitle], and [Root.GetHerHis] connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods at me, and I stare into the flames of the altar candle lights for a moment. When I finally speak, I imagine that I am praising [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] – unsurprising, my words have never seemed more true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_F;As I step up in front of them, my people eye me carefully. They depend on their [Root.GetTitle], and [Root.GetHerHis] connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them.

EVTDESC_MNM_3226_G;I strew the flowers around the feet of the statue, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods at me, and I bow before the ornamental sculpture. When I finally turn to address the gathering crowd, I imagine that it is[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] I am praising – unsurprising, my words have never seemed more true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_H;I strew the flowers around the feet of the statue, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods at me, and I bow before the beautifully carved sculpture. When I finally turn to address the gathering crowd, I imagine that it is[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] I am praising – unsurprising, my words have never seemed more true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_J;I strew the flowers around the feet of the statue, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] smiles at me, and I inhale deeply, while studying the ornamental carvings on the walls. When I finally speak, I imagine that I am praising [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] – unsurprising, my words have never seemed more true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_N;My voice carried by the crisp morning air, my words ring louder than I could have hoped. "Tengri creates death. We have all been created in order to die", I proclaim in front of the Sky God's followers. They nod eagerly, swallowing my lines with a warrior's thirst. They do not know that it is [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] that fuels my passion. Seeing their faces as I continue my speech, I am not sure it matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_O;I grab one of the torches of the ground and lift it high above my head. "The Creator watches, even in the night, when all seems dark..." I begin. Even though my heart has abandoned this faith, seeing their faces lit by the flame, I realize the power my words hold for them. They depend on me, their [Root.GetTitle] to guide them through their hardships. If it's their [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] by my side, I am not sure it matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3226_P;As I step up to the altar, the people eye me carefully. They depend upon me, as [Root.GetTitle] and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them.

EVTDESC_MNM_3227_A;As I step up to the altar, people eye me warily. They depend upon me, as [Root.GetTitle] and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods solemnly at me. I look up at the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], silently begging [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes and my heart sinks. I run off the stage, leaving rows of people confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_D;As I step up to the altar, the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s eye me warily. They depend upon me, as [Root.GetTitle] and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods solemnly at me. I look up at the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], silently begging [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes and my heart sinks. I run off the stage, leaving rows of people confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_E;With each step I take, my confidence fades. I turn to look at my people, and find their eyes wary. They need me, as [Root.GetTitle], and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods solemnly at me. I look up at the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], silently begging [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes. I run off the stage, leaving rows of people confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_F;As I step up to the altar, the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s eye me warily.

I look up at the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], silently begging [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes. I run off the stage, leaving rows of people confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_G;I strew the flowers around the feet of the statue, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods at me, and I bow before the ornamental sculpture. What can I tell them? In my heart, I pray to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes. I hastily exit the sanctuary, leaving my people confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_J;I strew the flowers around the feet of the statue, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] shoots me a suspicious glance, and I inhale deeply, while studying the ornamental carvings on the walls. Isn't [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] a vengeful god? The beautiful temple suddenly feels far too crowded. In a moment of weakness, I hastily exit the sanctuary, leaving the worshipers confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_N;As I walk up the steps, I begin to fidget. I turn to look at my people, only to find their eyes wary. Even the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] shoots me a suspicious glance, and I inhale sharply. A carved horse's head, which I used to find beautiful, glares at me and I find myself averting my eyes. Isn't [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] a vengeful god? The beautiful temple suddenly feels far too crowded and I decide to burst out of the building, leaving the worshipers confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_O;I strew the flowers around the altar, while the worshipers murmur at my presence. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] shoots me a suspicious glance and I take a deep breath, averting her eyes. The ancestral spirits can be vengeful, can they not? And why is it so warm here? The place suddenly feels far too crowded. Before I say anything at all, I hastily withdraw of the stage, leaving the worshipers confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3227_P;As I step up to the altar, the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s eye me warily. They depend upon me, as [Root.GetTitle] and my connection to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to guide them. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] nods solemnly at me. I look up at the ornamental windows of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship], silently begging [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] for some surge of inspiration – it never comes. Instead my heart beats frantically and I withdraw of the crowd, without a word to comfort them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3228_A;I step up to the altar and make a quick decision – as I reach the center of the stage I collapse to the floor. The worshipers gasp as I, their [Root.GetTitle], begin quoting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, everyone seems to be holding their breath. For a moment I worry that my stunt has failed. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] exclaims "A VISION! My [Root.GetLordLady], let me help you stand!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3228_G;I step up to the altar and make a quick decision – as I near a great statue of Vishnu, I collapse to the floor. Worshipers around me gasp as I, their [Root.GetTitle], begin quoting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, everyone seems to be holding their breath. For a moment I worry that my stunt has failed. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] exclaims "A VISION! My [Root.GetLordLady], let me help you stand!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3228_H;As I step up to the altar I make a quick decision – I collapse dramatically into the arms of a statue, to the gasps of onlooking worshipers. Then I begin quoting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, everyone seems to be holding their breath. For a moment I worry that my stunt has failed. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] exclaims "A VISION! My [Root.GetLordLady], let me help you stand!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

My [Root.GetLordLady], let me help you stand!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3229_A;I step towards the pulpit and make a bold decision – as I reach the center of the stage I collapse to the floor. The worshipers gasp as I, their [Root.GetTitle], begin quoting fragments of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, people start to whisper. For a moment I am convinced that my stunt has succeeded. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] prods at me. "Uhm, my [Root.GetLordLady]? Let's get you back onto your feet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3229_C;I step up to the altar and make a bold decision – as I reach the center of the stage I collapse to the floor.

When my last words ring out, people start to whisper. For a moment I am convinced that my stunt has succeeded. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] prods at me. "Uhm, my [Root.GetLordLady]? Let's get you back onto your feet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3229_D;I step forwards and make a bold decision – as I reach the center of the crowd I collapse to the floor. The worshipers gasp as I, their [Root.GetTitle], begin quoting fragments of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, people start to whisper. For a moment I am convinced that my stunt has succeeded. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] prods at me. "Uhm, my [Root.GetLordLady]? Let's get you back onto your feet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3229_G;I step forwards and make a bold decision – as I reach a group of people I collapse to the floor.

When my last words ring out, they start to whisper. For a moment I am convinced that my stunt has succeeded. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] prods at me. "Uhm, my [Root.GetLordLady]? Let's get you back onto your feet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_A;I make sure that I am regularly seen studying [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].\nToday my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName] came to me to compliment my efforts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_B;I have arranged for my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName] to help me with readings of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. [Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] commented that such a studiousness is evidence of a true faithful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_C;In my efforts to blend in with the believers around me, I believe I have come to learn more [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] theology than most of them know themselves.\nThey would be foolish to challenge my understanding of the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_D;A group of courtiers spotted me praying today. As they came within earshot I made sure to mutter the name of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] repeatedly.\nThey ended up joining me in my prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_E;I passed by a beggar in the street today and quoted a passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to her, loud enough for anyone passing by to hear. Apparently the exchange became quite the conversation starter at court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_F;I was studying copied pages of [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] with a fellow faithful when a servant entered my room unannounced. He apologized, but glanced across the scattered pages on my table... Both my companion and I let out a sigh of relief when the servant – in obvious illiteracy – complimented our dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3237;[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName] has offered to travel to my [Root.Capital.GetCapitalHolding] to support me in my secret ceremony. "For a fellow [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]", [fellow_member.GetSheHe] writes. While I consider my response, I place the letter onto the hearth. As the flames crumple the paper, I rest my hand on the pocket where I keep my hidden [Root.GetSRTrinketSymbol], safe, and away from prying eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS;I light the candles, while [fellow_member.GetFirstName], in a low voice, begins to sing a haunting melody. I bow my head, deciding resolutely that I am a true [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent] and this will not change. [fellow_member.GetFirstName] echoes my thoughts, when [fellow_member.GetSheHe] finally speaks: "This ceremony is as much for [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], as it is for us". I nod, and we join hands in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS_N_FRIENDSHIP;I light the candles, while [fellow_member.GetFirstName] begins to sing quietly, a haunting melody, in reverence to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. I close my eyes, in relief, over being able to practice my faith and to say the words of prayer without judgment. I look over to [fellow_member.GetFirstName], who is still singing, and I smile. Kinship such as this, is a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS_N_RIVAL_ROMANCE;I lit the candles, while [fellow_member.GetFirstName] began to sing quietly, a wistful melody, full of longing. I've never seen [fellow_member.GetHerHim] so solemn before, and I was struck by the admiration that welled up in me. By [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], I and [fellow_member.GetFirstName]? What was I thinking? I shook my head, trying to focus on the ceremony – in my heart, something flickered to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS_N_ROMANCE;I lit the candles, while [fellow_member.GetFirstName] began to sing quietly, a wistful melody. I swear by [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], I almost dropped the fire I was holding, as [fellow_member.GetHerHis] voice struck a brilliant chord in me. It was so beautiful – the hymn, and the [fellow_member.GetManWoman] performing it. I shook my head, trying to focus on the ceremony. In my heart, something flickered to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_NEUTRAL_OUTCOME;[fellow_member.GetFirstName] lights the candles, and I speak the words of prayer to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. I close my eyes as we join hands and bow our heads before the holy symbols on the wall. Performing a secret ceremony, in a secret chamber, I should be nervous, or excited. Or... something. I don't feel much at all? Yet [fellow_member.GetFirstName] turns to me afterwards. "Thank you, [Root.GetSisterBrother]. I needed this.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_SMALL_FAIL;[fellow_member.GetFirstName] lights the candles, as I speak the words of prayer to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. Hidden in this secret chamber, I can still hear the sounds of people outside. This had all seemed so clever before – now I am wondering if it is worth the risk of being discovered. I sigh and squeeze my pendant tightly, ignoring the rolling eyes of [fellow_member.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3239_SMALL_SUCCESS;[fellow_member.GetFirstName] lights the candles, and I speak the words of prayer to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. I close my eyes as we join hands and bow our heads before the holy symbols, the ones I usually keep hidden behind heavy curtains. This is how it should be – for a moment, all I can hear is the sound of my own breathing, and I feel... safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3239_SMALL_SUCCESS_N_RIVAL_ROMANCE;[fellow_member.GetFirstName] lights the candles, and I speak the words of prayer. To my surprise, [fellow_member.GetFirstName] takes my hand – the faint light of the room reflected only in [fellow_member.GetHerHis] eyes, and the holy symbol hanging from a pendant around [fellow_member.GetHerHis] neck. "We're supposed to be praying", I mumble and let go, still feeling the warmth of [fellow_member.GetHerHis] hand on my skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3239_TRAGIC_FAIL;I had just lit the candles when [unfortunate_interrupter.GetTitledName] walked in on us. [unfortunate_interrupter.GetSheHeCap] gasped at the sight of our foreign ceremony, but before [unfortunate_interrupter.GetSheHe] had time to alert the guards, [fellow_member.GetFirstName] tackled [unfortunate_interrupter.GetHerHim]. The [unfortunate_interrupter.GetManWoman] must've hit [unfortunate_interrupter.GetHerHis] head on something though – when the blood started pouring onto the floor, [fellow_member.GetFirstName] backed away in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3404;After some careful planning, I am seated next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a formal dinner. I have planned to tell [From.GetHerHim] about a family of [Root.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] that was attacked and driven from their home in [Root.Capital.GetName] in an attempt to rouse [From.GetHerHis] sympathies, but what angle should I employ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3405_A;I am sat next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a dinner when [From.GetSheHe] tells about a family of [From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] which was attacked in [From.GetHerHis] capital, [From.Capital.GetName]. 'They will never see their friends and relatives again, the poor souls,' [From.GetFirstName] says with a heavy sigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3405_B;I am sat next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a dinner when [From.GetSheHe] tells about a family of [From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] which was attacked in [From.GetHerHis] capital, [From.Capital.GetName]. 'I never saw them myself, but apparently the mother was maimed in the attack. The children will surely be haunted by nightmares for years to come,' [From.GetFirstName] sighs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3405_C;I am sat next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a dinner when [From.GetSheHe] tells about a family of [From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] which was attacked in [From.GetHerHis] capital, [From.Capital.GetName]. 'I wish they had been left alone – their business was a vital cog in the local economy and a great source of taxes,' [From.GetFirstName] sighs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3405_D;I am sat next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a dinner when [From.GetSheHe] tells about a family of [From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] which was attacked in [From.GetHerHis] capital, [From.Capital.GetName]. 'Nothing angers me as when people are persecuted and harmed, simply because of their faith!' [From.GetFirstName] growls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3406;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was visibly moved by the story about the poor family. After our conversation, [From.GetSheHe] became very quiet and only responded in short, half-hearted sentences when spoken to. Just before our departure, [From.GetFirstName] pulled me aside and thanked me for opening [From.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3407;[From.GetTitledFirstName] only scoffed at my story and haughtily claimed that the family, as 'a bunch of filthy heathens', only had themselves to blame. Then [From.GetSheHe] turned to the [From.GetManWomanOpp] on [From.GetHerHis] other side and proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3408;I have arranged for one of my spies to leave a tome of the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] with an anonymous note in the [secret_religion_inductee.GetChamber] of [secret_religion_inductee.GetTitledFirstName]. If the tome is left open on a passage which [secret_religion_inductee.GetFirstName] finds relevant, I am hopeful [secret_religion_inductee.GetSheHe] will find truth in the holy words – but what might catch [secret_religion_inductee.GetHerHis] eye...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3409;As I retired to my [secret_religion_inductee.GetChamber], I was shocked to find a copy of [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] of the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] faith on my bed! At first, I thought someone had left it there with the intention to frame me, but then I noticed a little note left on top of the open tome. 'I think you will find this interesting. Please, give it a chance. Signed, a friend.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3410_A;The copy of the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] I found in my [Root.GetChamber] had been left open on a passage on a legendary war and the brave heroes who fought in it to defend the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] faith. The story intrigued me enough to make me continue reading. Over the course of only a few weeks, I had finished the entire tome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3410_B;The copy of the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] I found in my [Root.GetChamber] had been left open on a passage on the importance of family, friends and the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] community. The words intrigued me enough to make me continue reading. Over the course of a few weeks, I had finished the entire tome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3410_C;The copy of the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] I found in my [Root.GetChamber] had been left open on a passage on the greater questions – right and wrong, the higher purpose, the afterlife – and as I pondered the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] perspective on these matters, I found myself intrigued enough to continue reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3410_D;The copy of the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] I found in my [Root.GetChamber] had been left open on a passage on a legendary [Root.GetQueenKing] and how [Root.GetHerHis] empire blossomed under [Root.GetHerHis] fair and steady rule. The story intrigued me enough to make me continue reading. Over the course of a few weeks, I had finished the entire tome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3411;My spies have brought me some outstanding news! Apparently [secret_religion_inductee.GetTitledFirstName] reads the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] every night and now seems to worship [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], like we do, in secret. My plan succeeded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3413;The spies I ordered to watch over [secret_religion_inductee.GetTitledFirstName] have brought me some disappointing news. As far as they have been able to determine, [secret_religion_inductee.GetFirstName] has not read the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] I left [secret_religion_inductee.GetHerHim]. They suspect [secret_religion_inductee.GetSheHe] has gotten rid of the holy text.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3420;The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] has everyone's full attention – except mine. My thoughts are elsewhere as I try to ignore [spiritual_gender.GetHerHis] sacrilegious words echoing through the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]. Suddenly, my concentration is shattered when the stranger next to me grabs my hand and draws something in my palm with [stranger.GetHerHis] index finger. The holy symbol of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3421_A;I follow the stranger as [secret_religion_recruiter.GetSheHe] departs from the crowd and ventures into a deserted alleyway. As I round the corner, I find [secret_religion_recruiter.GetHerHim] waiting. It is [secret_religion_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]! '[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'s blessings, [Root.GetFirstName]' [secret_religion_recruiter.GetSheHe] greets me. 'Are you ready to fight for the True Faith?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3421_B;I follow the stranger as [secret_religion_recruiter.GetSheHe] departs from the crowd and ventures into a deserted alleyway. As I round the corner, I find [secret_religion_recruiter.GetHerHim] waiting. '[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'s blessings, [Root.GetFirstName]' [secret_religion_recruiter.GetSheHe] greets me. 'My name is [secret_religion_recruiter.GetDynName]. Are you ready to fight for the True Faith?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3422;I covered my face before [secret_religion_recruit.GetReligiousRite] and once at the [secret_religion_recruit.GetHouseOfWorship] I sat down next to [secret_religion_recruit.GetFirstName]. At the end of the service, I grabbed [secret_religion_recruit.GetHerHis] hand and drew the holy symbol of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] with my finger in [secret_religion_recruit.GetHerHis] palm. Afterwards [secret_religion_recruit.GetSheHe] followed me into a deserted alley where I revealed my identity and invited [secret_religion_recruit.GetHerHim] to join us. [secret_religion_recruit.GetFirstName] said yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3423;I covered my face before [secret_religion_recruit.GetReligiousRite] and once at the [secret_religion_recruit.GetHouseOfWorship] I sat down next to [secret_religion_recruit.GetFirstName]. At the end of the service, I grabbed [secret_religion_recruit.GetHerHis] hand and drew the holy symbol of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] with my finger in [secret_religion_recruit.GetHerHis] palm. Afterwards, [secret_religion_recruit.GetSheHe] pretended like nothing had happened and I left the [secret_religion_recruit.GetHouseOfWorship], my quest unsuccessful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3424;A smile spreads across [secret_religion_recruiter.GetFirstName]'s [secret_religion_recruiter.GetFaceDescription] face. 'Excellent. Then I am honored to welcome you to [secret_religion_recruiter.Society.GetName]. Together we work to bring about the liberation of the true believers and a new era of [secret_religion_recruiter.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'s glory. You will receive your first mission soon.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3430;Lately, I have found myself worrying about my little [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName]. The [From.GetLadLass] is brought up believing in a false god who can offer [From.GetHerHim] nothing but illusions and hollow promises. Perhaps [From.GetFirstName] is ready to be introduced to the true faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3431_A;When my [GetFromRelation] summoned me to [From.GetHerHis] study, I thought it was time for another boring lecture on manners or morals. However, as I enter the room, [From.GetSheHe] invites me to sit next to [From.GetHerHim] and proceeds to read from a thick tome, which [From.GetSheHe] calls 'the [From.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName]'. The stories are about kings and queens, '[From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons]' and the almighty '[From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3431_B;When my [GetFromRelation] summoned me to [From.GetHerHis] study, I thought it was time for another boring lecture on manners or morals. However, as I enter the room, [From.GetSheHe] invites me to sit next to [From.GetHerHim]. With an open [From.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] resting on [From.GetHerHis] lap, [From.GetSheHe] proceeds to explain some 'essential' matters which [From.GetSheHe] says the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] has gotten wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3432;I summoned [From.GetFirstName] to my study where I proceeded to read [From.GetHerHim] the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName]. At first, the [From.GetLadLass] was fidgeting in [From.GetHerHis] seat, but my choice of passage was a good one. Soon [From.GetSheHe] hung on my every word, eyes round as the full moon. As I put the tome away, [From.GetFirstName] bombarded me with questions and we kept talking for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3433;I summoned [From.GetFirstName] to my study where I proceeded to read [From.GetHerHim] the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] seemed to truly enjoy the story. While [From.GetFirstName] was more excited about returning to [From.GetHerHis] playmates than having a conversation about what I had just read, I think I got through to [From.GetHerHim] in some way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3434;I summoned [From.GetFirstName] to my study where I proceeded to read [From.GetHerHim] the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName]. I could tell from the first minute that I had a real challenge ahead of me. The [From.GetLadLass] was fidgeting in [From.GetHerHis] seat and played with [From.GetHerHis] sleeves. However, I was not expecting [From.GetHerHim] to shout at me when I brought up [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3435;Yet again, I have been summoned to my [GetFromRelation]'s study. [From.GetSheHeCap] is cradling the tome from which [From.GetSheHe] read last time, but today I am not given a lecture. Instead, we are having a conversation about [From.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] and [From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is asking me questions and patiently listens to my responses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3436;This time around, instead of lecturing, I tried to have a conversation with [From.GetFirstName] and listened patiently to what [From.GetSheHe] had to say. We discussed [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] and the [Root.GetTrueReligionGroupPersons] at lengths, and in the end it seemed like [From.GetFirstName] understood and agreed with my point of view!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3437;This time around, instead of lecturing, I tried to have a conversation with [From.GetFirstName] and listened patiently to what [From.GetSheHe] had to say. Sadly, even though [From.GetSheHe] was more willing to listen to me as well, [From.GetHerHis] opinions were set in stone. [From.GetSheHeCap] refused to question the things the [From.Religion.GetPriestTitle] had taught [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3502;The last few months have been tough, so when I was invited to the home of [From.GetTitledFirstName] for a small ceremony, it felt like a gift from [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] words about staying brave and the importance of community touched me deeply. I mentioned this after the ceremony was over, and we ended up talking for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3506_A;You rarely find a more devoted follower of [From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] than my fellow [From.GetTrueReligionPerson], [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. While this is a respectable quality, the good [From.GetSocietyRank] can sometimes struggle to hide [From.GetHerHis] true religion. [From.GetHerHisCap] inability to tell a good lie is a danger to [From.GetHerselfHimself] as well as [From.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3506_B;You rarely find a more devoted follower of [From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] than my fellow [From.GetTrueReligionPerson], [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].

EVTDESC_MNM_3507_A;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] approached me the other day with a somber look upon [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetFaceDescription] face. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me [From.GetSheHe] was worried about my honesty. 'Normally, it is a fine quality in a [Root.GetTrueReligionPerson], but you ought to be more careful.' [From.GetFirstName] offered to help me become a better liar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3507_B;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] approached me the other day with a somber look upon [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetFaceDescription] face.

[From.GetFirstName] offered to help me manage my anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3507_C;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] approached me the other day with a somber look upon [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetFaceDescription] face. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me [From.GetSheHe] was worried about my occasional sloppiness. 'Normally, I would not dare to criticize, but I fear your tendency to forget things here and there is a threat our secret.' [From.GetFirstName] offered to help me become more attentive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3507_D;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] approached me the other day with a somber look upon [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetFaceDescription] face.

[From.GetFirstName] offered to help me become more aware of my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3508;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] listened to my concerns and agreed to accept my help. Since then, we have met a few evenings each week to work on [From.GetHerHis] flaws together.

EVTDESC_MNM_3510;When I approached [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] simply dismissed my concerns. I plead to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] to keep the fool in check and all of us safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3511;Since our conversation a few weeks ago, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I have met a few evenings each week.

EVTDESC_MNM_3512;Since our conversation a few weeks ago, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I have met a few evenings each week to work together. It has been a struggle. I have tried my very best, but can I deny that which is in my nature? Did not [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] create me like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3800;The time has come! [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] believes our secret community of faithful has grown strong enough to no longer need to hide in the shadows. It is time to profess to the entire realm that I am a true follower of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], standing proud with my [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3810;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed an astounding secret. [From.GetSheHeCap] is a [From.GetTrueReligionAdherent], and [From.GetSheHe] is not alone among the nobility of our realm. I have long held an interest in the practices of [From.TrueReligion.GetName] believers, and [From.GetFirstName] has encouraged all those who hold true faith in their heart to profess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3811;At long last, we reap the rewards of our hard work. Any fellow [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] willing shall join me in this victory, as I find peace and prosperity in revealing the struggle which has been going on in our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3820;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed a shocking truth. [From.GetSheHeCap] is a [From.GetTrueReligionAdherent], and [From.GetSheHe] is not alone among the nobility of our realm. For years they have been building communities of adherents to their faith, and there are even places in my own lands where most of the populace prays to [From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3830;While [From.GetTitledFirstName] has always been a little strange, I never could have known that [From.GetSheHe] was secretly a [From.GetTrueReligionAdherent]! Along with a community of other nobles in my realm who have been harboring infidel beliefs for years, [From.GetSheHe] has now openly professed to what [From.GetSheHe] dares call 'the true faith.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3840;While [From.GetTitledFirstName] has always been a little strange, I never could have known that [From.GetSheHe] was secretly a [From.GetTrueReligionAdherent]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3850;While there are only a handful of them, there are a few people in [target_province.GetName] who by the grace of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] are willing to attend our hidden [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] sermons. It will take a long time, but they will become true converts, and will be able to spread our message to ever more new believers. One day we will openly join together in our faith, without fear of persecution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3858;With the passing of [target_province.GetName] from our realm, my fellow believers and I are finding it to be more challenging than ever to spread the word of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] there.\nPeople seemed to be listening, but for now our efforts must be abandoned until we find a new opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3860;Our effort to establish a community of [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]s in [target_province.GetName] has proven far easier than I thought.

EVTDESC_MNM_3870;Our effort to establish a community of [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]s in [target_province.GetName] is going well. As the congregation grows in number, so does its influence, and more people turn to the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3880;Our effort to establish a community of [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]s in [target_province.GetName] is not working out. The preachers I have given charge of the congregation to are struggling to attract new believers, and without growth even some of our early converts are starting to harbor doubts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3890;After much work, dedication and prayer, the community of [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]s in [target_province.GetName] has grown far larger than what it once was. Believers in great numbers share joy and hardships while ensuring their faith stays hidden from the wider world. The congregation has become a small cosmos of faithful, and new converts find the truth of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] by the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3901;[Root.GetSRGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nOur community is growing steadily in the shadows, but for our ultimate goal to see the light of day we need to have the support of the local populace.

EVTDESC_MNM_3910;There's a rumor about an artist in the vicinity that creates the most magnificent landscape paintings with features of human nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3911;I got a personal unveiling of the painting I commissioned for. The artist truly did a remarkable job with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3912;When I showed off my latest addition to my art collection one particular person spent a long time studying the painting. Turns out that it was [society_art_observer.GetSocietyRank] [society_art_observer.GetFirstName] whom later shook my hand and discretely left a [Root.GetSRTrinketSymbol] in my palm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3914;After spending weeks improving the painting I proudly take a step back to behold my work. Sweat gathers on my forehead as I realize what my additions to the painting actually looks like: The original painting is beyond repair! It is now riddled with stick figures, random shapes, and other artistic mishaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3920;I was in the middle of a conversation with the chef when [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] appears from nowhere, grabs me by the arm and pulls me to a nearby room. With a wrinkled forehead and sweaty palms [worried_secret_member.GetSheHe] told me that [worried_secret_member.GetSheHe] intend to leave our society after being haunted too many times by shadows in the darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3921_A;I gave a speech to [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] about the importance of solidarity for our movement. I emphasized how important every member of our society is so that we can be strong together. [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] seemed to sympathize with my speech and told me that [worried_secret_member.GetSheHe] will continue to back our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3921_B;I gave a speech to [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] about the importance of solidarity for our movement.

EVTDESC_MNM_3921_C;I told [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] that this is a time of trials but that we have to endure. [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] observes us and will reward us in due time. Feeling the pressure of divine intervention [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] promised to keep our true faith for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3921_D;I told [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] that this is a time of trials but that we have to endure. [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] observes us and will reward us in due time. However, [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] was still more worried about the present situation than divine judgement and ran off before I could stop [worried_secret_member.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3921_E;After getting [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] seated and listened to [worried_secret_member.GetHerHis] worried feelings I managed to calm [worried_secret_member.GetHerHim] down. After having ventilated most of [worried_secret_member.GetHerHis] thoughts [worried_secret_member.GetFirstName] was determined that our community and cause is something worth fighting for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3930;One of my [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] fellows, [society_character.GetTitledFirstName], has expressed worry that the stress of keeping my true faith hidden is getting to me. [society_character.GetSheHeCap] is suggesting that an incognito evening at a local tavern would do me good, away from the prying eyes of the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3932;[society_character.GetSocietyRank] [society_character.GetFirstName] was entirely right that I needed to get away from court, but there is no denying that we got carried away at the tavern. When our [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] leanings became a bit too clear, a local rough suddenly rose from his seat and staggered with raised fists towards [society_character.GetFirstName]. "You'll pay for your heretical words!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3933_FAILURE;As it turns out, the beginning of a bar fight is not the best place for theological debate. My argument was drowned out by the shout of pain from [society_character.GetTitledFirstName] as the first punch was thrown. After that the entire tavern descended into chaos. To make matters worse, the brawler who had initiated the fight quoted lines from [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] as we were thrown on our faces into the street.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3933_SUCCESS;It didn't take long to calm the brawler, as just a few leaps of logic was enough to convince him that our beliefs weren't so fundamentally different. After sitting together for the rest of the evening, he even reluctantly admitted that there might be something to our [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] arguments after all! Later, [society_character.GetTitledFirstName] complimented me on my theological efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3934_FAILURE;Some kind of divine fury must have driven the brawler, for he turned out to be an unstoppable beast! Even as we tried to restrain him simultaneously he merely shrugged us off and let his fists fly. Soon others joined in the fight on both sides, and we crawled our way to safety. As we made our way out we could still hear praise for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] shouted over the sound of cracking wood and shattering glass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3934_SUCCESS;In these dark times, [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent]s must stand up for each other. I shoved [society_character.GetTitledFirstName] out of the way of the first punch, and as the tavern descended into brawling chaos I made sure [society_character.GetSheHe] was left unharmed. In the end my fists were battered and bruised, but there was not a single person left standing who dared question me when I proclaimed the superiority of the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3949;I feel the [old_religion.Religion.GetName] way of life calling to me still. My [demander.GetLordLady]'s demand for me to abandon my beliefs and never enter my [old_religion.GetHouseOfWorship] again only makes the urge stronger. I find no truth in the [demander.Religion.GetName] faith and truly doubt [demander.GetHerHis] [demander.GetHouseOfWorship] will ever be a place for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3950;In order to make sure that the oppression of [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] followers comes to an end, I have decided to take action. I will focus my efforts on organizing my fellow believers, so that we in time, when we are too many to be ignored, can express our faith without any fear of repercussions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3951;Even though I am now publicly proclaiming the greatness of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I will still hold my [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] ideals in my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_3220_HONEST;The weight of carrying my beliefs in secret is becoming increasingly difficult. I am not fond of lying, and so when [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] bids me farewell after an audience, and [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] blesses me in the name of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I shift uncomfortably in my seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3220_SHY;Being a [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent], but pretending that I am not, has begun to make me shy away of conversation on religious matters. From the frown on some people's faces, I worry that my indecision is becoming noticeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3220_TRUSTING;I have been thinking about my efforts to blend into the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] community and while I am aware of what is expected of me, I am often overcome with the desire to talk to someone. Perhaps [trusted_friend.GetTitledName]? Surely [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] would understand my struggle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3221_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] I reply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] certainly could treat us better. [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] hesitates for a second, but then laughs. "You have such nerve, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] says. "It's all in jest, my friend" I say, only half-faking my smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3221_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural], somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology. When prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I offered them my most stony gaze in return. "Of course, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Your opinion is obviously that of the traditional scholars. Our apologies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3221_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and I must admit to feeling better after talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. While I left out the most important details of my current spiritual anxieties, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] concluded our meeting by placing an encouraging hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3222_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I am at a loss for words. "Something the matter, my [Root.GetLordLady]?" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] asks. "It's nothing", I say, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] does not seem convinced. "I know you are struggling with your faith, my friend" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] then says, before continuing: "– but you must stop. For the sake of the realm.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3222_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology... When I was finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I shrunk into my chair and mumbled something about us all perhaps making an effort to get along. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wouldn't want us to squabble", I concluded, but they did not seem convinced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3222_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and at first I felt a lot better simply talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. I struggled to leave out the details of my current spiritual anxieties, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] shot me glances of concern throughout our meeting. As we parted, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it... Even if you are not, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3223_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I reply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has already blessed me, with the companionship we share. [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] gives an earnest smile. "Always so eloquent, my [Root.GetLordLady]". "Only among my friends" I respond, giving a mock bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3223_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology. When finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I slammed my fist into the table, stating that there is only one true religion, before smiling gently. Their faces reddened. "Of course, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Our apologies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3223_TRUSTING;I invited [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] to a walk today. While not disclosing too much, I gently steered our conversation towards [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] theological views. "I think perhaps that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is just a name, for a concept we share with many, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] admitted in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3224_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I am at a loss for words. "Something the matter, my [Root.GetLordLady]?" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] asks. "It's nothing", I say, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] only sighs, exasperated. "I refused to believe the rumors, but you truly do not believe in our [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] anymore, do you? My [Root.GetTitle], you'll doom us all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3224_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology... When I was finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I shrunk into my chair. "Surely, we have more important things to discuss", I mumbled. "More important than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], my [Root.GetLordLady]?" came the retort, aghast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3224_TRUSTING;I have been avoiding [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] for some time now. When [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] eventually caught me, it was awkward. "Something has changed in you, my [Root.GetLordLady]" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] said stiffly. My stomach lurched. "It is not you, it is I", I confessed. Then I told [trusted_friend.GetHerHim] that I've been doubting [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s plan for me. [trusted_friend.GetSheHeCap] seemed unimpressed. I hope I have not said too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3234_CONDUCT_SECRET_CEREMONY;[Root.GetSRGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nAs a secret practitioner of our religion it is sometimes easy to neglect your true self. For your sake, as well as that of [This.Society.GetName], we ask that you conduct a secret ceremony in honor of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName].\n\n[Root.GetSRFarewell],\nSigned, [society_leader.GetSocietyRank] [society_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_3398_BLEND_IN;[Root.GetSRGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nAs secret practitioners of our religion we are under constant scrutiny.

EVTDESC_3399;Starting today, I shall dedicate myself to convincing the court of my deep devoutness, in the name of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] faith and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. My allies in [This.Society.GetName] will understand. This is a necessary step if I am to ever convince my people to see the path I, nay, [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] has actually laid out before them. They will thank me later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_MNM_3507_FAIL_TT;you failing to learn anything.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_3220_SHY;If I don't have anything intelligent to say, it's better that I am quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3220_TRUSTING;I'll summon a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3221_HONEST;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], give me strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_3222_TOOLTIP;You §Ydecrease§! the progress of your mission.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3222_TRUSTING;Oh no! I cannot afford rumors of my faith wavering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_3223_TOOLTIP;You §Ysignificantly increase§! the progress of your mission.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3223_TRUSTING;Interested indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_3224_TOOLTIP;You §Ysignificantly decrease§! the progress of your mission.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3224_TRUSTING;I thought [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] would understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3912;I'm happy to have other enlightened fellows around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3914;I hope someone can appreciate this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_3930;That sounds like exactly what I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_3220_HONEST;The show must go on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_3220_SHY;I need to play along more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_3220_TRUSTING;I can't trust anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_3914;I'll have to hide this catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_3930;Is [society_character.GetSheHe] joking? I have so much to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTOPTA_MNM_3202;Of course I could, [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_3207;No, wait! I know lines of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_3226;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] guides me, even now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3227;This is not what I had intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3228;Oh, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_3230_C;Certain aspects of this endeavor are easier than others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3230_D;That was unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3230_E;For once, gossip works in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3230_F;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3237;I appreciate the gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3237_TT;I will see to the preparations.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS;It was extraordinary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS_TT_1;You complete the ceremony and walk away with a renewed faith.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_BIG_SUCCESS_TT_2;You complete the ceremony and walk away with a new-found strength, and some interesting feelings...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_NEUTRAL_OUTCOME;I'm glad for you, [fellow_member.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_NEUTRAL_OUTCOME_TT;You complete the ceremony, and §Y[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]§! smiles at you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_SMALL_FAIL;I don't need your judgment, [fellow_member.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_SMALL_FAIL_TT;You complete the ceremony, but agree to not talk about it.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_SMALL_SUCCESS;We should do this again, sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_SMALL_SUCCESS_TT_1;You complete the ceremony, both you and §Y[fellow_member.GetTitledFirstName]§! feeling better.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_SMALL_SUCCESS_TT_2;You complete the ceremony, and walk away with some new and confusing feelings...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_TRAGIC_FAIL;This is terrible! What did you do?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3239_TRAGIC_FAIL_TT;Even though an unfortunate accident, the ceremony to [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] is a complete failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3399;I'll make them see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3404;They were forced to leave many loved ones behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3404_TT;Talk about the relatives and friends of the attacked family and how they will never see each other again, hoping this will tug on the heartstrings of §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3405;Such senseless violence! My heart aches for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3406;I knew we would find an ally in [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3407;[From.GetFirstName] is not yet ready to accept the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3408;A tale about a legendary warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3408_TT;Leave the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName] open on a passage about war and warriors, hoping it will be relevant to §Y[secret_religion_inductee.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3409;Intriguing. I guess a little read cannot hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3409_TT;Read the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] [secret_religion_inductor.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3410;I have been blind, but now I see! Never have I read truer words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3410_TT;Secretly adopt the [secret_religion_inductor.TrueReligion.GetName] faith.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3411;It is time for [secret_religion_inductee.GetTitledFirstName] to join us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_3412;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], I have failed you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3420;I must follow them once [Root.GetReligiousRite] is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3420_TT;Follow the mysterious stranger who drew the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] symbol in your palm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3421;I have been waiting for this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3421_TT;Ensure §Y[secret_religion_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! that you want to join the secret [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3422;Another champion of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] joins our ranks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3423;Such a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3424;[secret_religion_recruiter.GetSRFarewell], [secret_religion_recruiter.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3430;I shall read [From.GetHerHim] the [Root.SecretReligion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3430_TT;Attempt to induct §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! into the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3431;I guess that makes sense. Can I play now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3432;I really got through to little [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3433;This is a first step, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3434;I will give this one more try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3435;I think I understand now, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3436;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'s truth shall always prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3502;Thank you. Now I realize I am not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3506;I shall offer [From.GetFirstName] my help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3506_TT;You approach §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and offer [From.GetHerHim] your help in dealing with [From.GetHerHis] struggles to keep [From.GetHerHis] true religion hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3507;I will accept [From.GetHerHis] thoughtful offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3507_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! will attempt to help you hide your true religion.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3508_TT;The visibility and risk of discovery of §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! decreases.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3509;I expected more from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3511;I thank you for your help and patience, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3511_TT;Your visibility and risk of discovery has decreased.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3512;I hope [From.GetFirstName] isn't too disappointed with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3800;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3810;Welcome me into your arms, [From.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3811;A new era begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3811_TT;All your fellow followers of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName], within your realm, will convert to your true religion, while others will be offered the choice to follow suit!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3820;How did they keep it secret for so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3830;There suddenly seems to be an awful lot of these [From.TrueReligion.GetName] believers around...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3840;That was certainly a daring revelation of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3850;In due time these beautiful seeds will blossom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3858;We can no longer safely operate in that area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3860;[target_province.GetName] is blessed by [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3870;We continue in [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]'s name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3880;I will provide all the support they require.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3890;You all rest in the embrace of [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3910;I need to have one of those in my possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3911;But it feels like something is missing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3920;Persuade by talking about solidarity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3921;One for all, and all for one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_3932;"You're misunderstanding! Let me explain...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
