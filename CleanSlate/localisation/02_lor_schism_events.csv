EVTNAMELoR.210;The Great Schism Mended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.200;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Antioch has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint Peter the Apostle, who is regarded as the first Pope by the Western Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.201;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Jerusalem has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint James the Just, who was made head of the Church in Jerusalem soon after the death of Jesus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.202;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Alexandria has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was originally founded by Saint Mark the Evangelist, who became Alexandria's first patriarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.203;With the city back under East Roman control, the Patriarchate of Rome has been properly restored as one of the episcopal sees of the Pentarchy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. If all five historical patriarchates are returned to the Pentarchy, the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western churches may finally be mended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.210;At last the Great Schism between the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church has been mended. With the spread of Orthodoxy and the reunification of the Pentarchy, including the vital episcopal see of Rome, the Catholic faith now holds little sway over the people of Europe. There will be those who still cling to it, but they will be few in number and the Pentarchy can once more claim universal rule over all of Christendom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.200;God be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.211;If that's the way the wind is blowing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBLoR.211;I will never give up my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPLoR.210;The Great Schism is mended and Christendom reunited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
