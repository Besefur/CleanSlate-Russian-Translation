# Military Accident
evt_marshal_001_title;Military Drill Accident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_001_desc_a;I was skeptical about my visit to [Root.Location.GetName] to try and find some way to get into the thickheaded peasants how different sorts of military equipment should be best used. Of course they managed to fumble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_001_option_a;They wounded me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_001_option_b;They maimed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_001_option_tooltip;Send a letter to my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Liege gets a letter about Marshal being wounded
evt_marshal_002_desc_a;My liege, I was trying to teach the thickheaded peasants of [From.Location.GetName] how to use siege weapons when one of them dropped a boulder on my foot! I despair of ever teaching these idiots how to wage war...\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_002_option_a;Oh dear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Liege gets a letter about Marshal being maimed
evt_marshal_003_desc_a;My liege, I implore you to send me to another county! The nitwits of [From.Location.GetName] have already cost me one limb, I don't want to lose any more limbs just because they don't know the back from the front of an arrow!\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_003_option_a;How can I wage war with these peasants?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# Military Secrets Revealed!
evt_marshal_101_title;Military Secrets Revealed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_101_desc_a;I had traveled to [Root.Location.GetName] to try and help teach the population about the military equipment they have at their disposal, in case they would ever be besieged or if my liege would need to recruit soldiers from the province. But I feel I am getting nowhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_101_option_a;If only something would go my way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_101_option_a_tooltip;A chance meeting with a local noble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble helps
evt_marshal_102_desc_a;On the road to [From.Location.GetName] I met [From.GetTitledName], the Marshal of [From.Liege.GetTitledName]. I knew [From.GetSheHe] would be interested in the military advancements I have done lately. Should I share them with [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_102_option_a;I see no reason why not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_102_option_a_tooltip;Talk to [This.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_102_option_b;I better keep it to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Inform Marshal
evt_marshal_103_desc_a;I left the soldiers of [Root.Location.GetName] one evening feeling exhausted and world-weary when a local noble, [From.GetTitledName], approached me and told me about the military advancements he had implemented lately. I promised [From.GetHerHim] to use it wisely and not spread the knowledge outside the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_103_option_a;Such an important discovery must be shared with my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_103_option_a_tooltip;Send a letter to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Inform Liege
evt_marshal_104_desc_a;My liege, good news! During my mission to [From.Location.GetName] I happened to meet the noble [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. After promising [FromFrom.GetHerHim] not to divulge any of the information outside the realm, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] decided to share with me some of the military advancements [FromFrom.GetSheHe] had implemented in the last year. Enclosed with this letter is a document describing them in more detail.\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_104_option_a;Exciting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# Reinforcements Arrive
evt_marshal_201_title;Levy Reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_201_desc_a;Since I came to [Root.Location.GetName], we have never had a shortage of soldiers reinforcing our troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_201_option_a;They know that fame and fortune awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Inform Liege
evt_marshal_202_desc_a;Your [Root.GetMyMarshalName], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has initiated a massive recruitment drive in ยงY[From.Location.GetName]ยง!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_202_option_a;Let us hope so;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# Marshal tries to train troops, noble interferes
evt_marshal_301_title;Noble Interferes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_301_desc_a;The levy situation in [Root.Location.GetName] is not entirely hopeless, but close enough. I will do my best to revive the situation and hopefully my liege will see some results soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_301_option_a;As long as no one meddles with my plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble reacts
evt_marshal_302_desc_a;[From.Liege.GetTitledName]'s Marshal, [From.GetTitledName], have been trying to raise more and more levies in [From.Location.GetName]. I can't stand [From.GetHerHim]! Perhaps I should pull some strings and see to it that no more peasants show up for his recruiting meetings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_302_option_a;I will take every chance I get!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_302_option_b;I better not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Marshal writes to Liege
evt_marshal_303_desc_a;My liege, I have bad news from [FromFrom.Location.GetName]. My attempts to increase the county levy has met with nothing but failure and the reason behind this is [From.GetTitledName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] has been nothing but trouble since I arrived and has used [From.GetHerHis] wide influence in [FromFrom.Location.GetName] to hinder all my initiatives.\n\nYour humble [Root.GetMarshalName],\n[Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_303_option_a;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# The Marshal has managed to raise an eager force of raiders
evt_marshal_401_title;Raid Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_401_desc_a;With enticing words of riches beyond measure, I have gathered up a mighty host in [Root.Location.GetName]. These men do not like to sit idle though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_401_option_a;My [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege is informed
evt_marshal_402_desc_a;My [Root.GetMyMarshalName], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has gathered up a great host of raiders, lusting for plunder and wanton destruction. I must use these men and not allow them to sit idle for too long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_402_option_a;Great news indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The men are displeased and disband
evt_marshal_404_desc_a;The raiding party my [Root.GetMyMarshalName] gathered up to fight for me have grown tired of my effeminate pacifism and gone home to their wives, but not before picking up everything they could find of value!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_marshal_404_option_a;Thieves! Uh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP20410;Send a letter to my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP20420;A local noble interferes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Unused
EVTNAME944;Marshal Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC944;My liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] sent me to [Root.Location.GetName] to assist in the arrest of a local noble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA944;Hope we'll catch the right noble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20440;[From.GetTitledName] has been seen in [From.Location.GetName] and I am certain [From.GetSheHe] is here for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20440;I can't do anything about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB20440;Minions, prepare for ambush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20441;The men attacking me shows no mercy, I try to defend myself as good as I can but there are too many of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20441;I managed to fend them off but lost a limb!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB20441;I managed to flee after they severely wounded me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20442;'My liege, I was attacked by...'\nThe blotted paper was nearly unreadable, clearly [From.GetTitledName] wrote the letter just after the attack. As I squinted to try and make out what the Marshal wrote in the letter, some words suddenly becomes clear:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20442;...maimed... ...noble named... Good lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB20442;...wounded... Only wounded!? Pah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20443;My loyal men managed to kill [From.GetTitledName]! [From.Liege.GetTitledName] will never catch me, but I should pretend as nothing happens and send my condolences to make sure [From.Liege.GetSheHe] believes I had nothing to do with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20443;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20444;My [Root.GetTitle], I am sorry to report the death of your Marshal. My condolences.\n\nYour humble [From.GetTitle]\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20444;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP20441;[From.GetTitledName] is ambushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP20442;My liege must be informed of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP20443;[Root.GetTitledName] is killed by the attackers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP20444;[Root.GetTitledName] sends a letter to [From.Liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP20392;A letter is sent to [This.GetTitledFirstName], telling [This.GetHerHim] about the helpful noble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP20421;The treacherous acts of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] greatly upsets [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
