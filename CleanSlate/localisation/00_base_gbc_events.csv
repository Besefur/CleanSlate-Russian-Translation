EVTDESC_GBC_1;[GBC_dead_one.GetTitledFirstName] died from the plague. Oh noes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_2;It's been a while since [GBC_dead_one.GetTitledName] left this mortal world, but not a day goes by that [GBC_dead_one.GetSheHe] does not cross your mind. It can be in the morning, when you first put your feet on the cold floor - you pause as you suddenly remember the black blisters on [GBC_dead_one.GetHerHis] skin. It can be during supper, when [GBC_dead_one.GetHerHis] favorite food is being served, but what can you do? Should you demand the next child at court be named after [GBC_dead_one.GetHerHim]? \n\nYou shake your head. Most often the doubts come in the night. When the stars are out, the world is quiet and you are alone with your thoughts. Such a horrible fate [GBC_dead_one.GetSheHe] suffered, in the end. Was it truly the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_3_A;I've been thinking a lot on [GBC_dead_one.GetTitledName] and what happens when we die. My [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] has advised me to look inwards and let the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] comfort me. Yet when I'm alone in the dark any divine presence fails me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_3_B;I've been thinking a lot on [GBC_dead_one.GetTitledName] and what happens when we die. I've tried looking inwards and let the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] comfort me, yet when I'm alone in the dark any divine presence fails me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_5;[GBC_new_friend.GetTitledFirstName] approached me today. Apparently [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] has noticed the regularity with which I've been visiting the grave of [GBC_dead_one.GetTitledName], but [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] hasn't wanted to disturb me... "Surely a [Root.GetTitle] doesn't need to talk about [Root.GetHerHis] grief" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] said, smiling awkwardly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_6;[GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] tells me that our [GBC_dead_one.GetTitledName] had a way with birds. I had no idea! Noticing my astonished expression, [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] has now introduced me to Hedwig, an adorable little owl. Apparently it used to belong to [GBC_dead_one.GetFirstName]. "I think she likes you" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] says, stroking its head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_8;Alone in my chambers, having just fed my beloved bird, [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] bursts into the room, promptly marching over to Hedwig. "I've changed my mind!" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] says belligerently, grabbing the cage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_9;[GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] pauses and hides [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] face in [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] hands. "I'm sorry, [Root.GetFirstName]. I don't know what I'm doing." When [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] finally meets my eyes, tears stain [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] cheeks. "I think I'm dying. You're going to lose me, like we lost [GBC_dead_one.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_10;[GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] drops to [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] knees and starts to loudly sob, face in [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] hands. "Oh, [Root.GetFirstName], I shouldn't burden you with this. Nay, I should not even be here!" Hedwig tilts her head at you as [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] runs away, leaving you alone with the puzzled bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_11;[GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] throws a fist into the wall and curses under [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] breath before turning to you. "You don't understand, do you, my [Root.GetLordLady]?! Everyone will disappear! You and me. Even this stupid bird!" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] yells. The owl glances at you, indifference in her eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_12_A;The idea that [GBC_new_friend.GetTitledName] would be taken from this world has had an effect on your posture. When [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] joins you for breakfast one morning, a spring in [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] step and a wide smile on [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] face, you unconsciously straighten your back. The usually pale countenance of your friend has even made your own appetite vanish on occasion. Yet there is something different about [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHim] now... \n\n"The physician tells me it was just a fever!" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] says jubilantly, joining you at your table. "Oh, come on, [Root.GetFirstName]. You didn't think I'd abandon you, did you? Who'd look after the country? Alright, alright, but who would've looked after you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_12_B;The two of you haven't spent that much time together recently, so you are a little surprised when [GBC_new_friend.GetTitledName] joins you for breakfast one morning. The expression on [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] face is a mixture of joy and embarrassment and [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] eats [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] food slowly, almost hesitantly, as if [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] is about to say something but is having trouble phrasing [GBC_new_friend.GetHerselfHimself]. \n\n"I thought I was dying" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] says finally, making your hand and drink stop mid-air.\n"Dying?" you repeat. \n"Nonsense, of course, it was simply a fever" [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] continues, flushing a little. "I'm sorry if I worried you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_13_A;For fear of contagion the physician wouldn't let you see [GBC_new_friend.GetTitledName] as [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] lay on [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] deathbed. Maybe it doesn't matter. Even though [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] must have known that [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] was on your mind, you ordered every choir in [Root.Capital.GetName] to take up residence in the main hall for an indefinite period of time - they were to perform [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName]'s favorite hymns until [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] had safely passed over to the next world, knowing that [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] was loved in this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_13_B;[GBC_new_friend.GetTitledName] did not ask for you as [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] lay on [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] deathbed. Maybe it doesn't matter. [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHeCap] probably knew you had important matters to see to, places and meetings to attend. Yet the work in [Root.Location.GetName] could have waited, couldn't it? After all, you were kin and [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] should have had somebody by [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] side as she ascended into the realm of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nThe physician says [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] went quietly, in [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] sleep, [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] last words uttered simply being: "I'm tired. Let me rest.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_17_A;When [GBC_new_friend.GetTitledFirstName] invited me hunting, I was thrilled! [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHeCap] seemed a little nervous to make eye contact with me at first, but we quickly fell into our old banter. I was also introduced to [Root.GetFirstName], [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName]'s new falcon! If that [GBC_new_friend.GetManWoman] is ill [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe]'s hiding it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_17_B;When [GBC_new_friend.GetTitledFirstName] invited me hunting, I hesitated. I guess I've sort of been avoiding [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHim] since our last conversation, but my heart said it's time I forgive [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] break-down. While it was fun and [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe] showed me [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHis] new falcon, I wish [GBC_new_friend.GetSheHe]'d talk to me about what is tormenting [GBC_new_friend.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GBC_73;My councillor [GBC_nice_councillor.GetFirstName] raised an eyebrow at me during a meeting today. "I've noticed your kins[GBC_new_friend.GetManWoman] [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName] has been visiting you more often, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I wasn't aware you two were close?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDSC_GBC_102;Today is the day. The one I've been dreading. While I have kept my appearances up throughout the ceremony, a paralyzing doubt is gnawing at my soul. My new [gbc_spouse.GetHusbandWife], [gbc_spouse.GetFirstName], is certainly a good match - but is that all there is to it? I know people like us never marry for love, but why does the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] talk of such things? I fear dying without ever having known true love. \n\nDuring the following wedding feast I feel as if I am moving through thick fog, mechanically repeating the motions, just as I have been taught. \n\nThat is, until I see [gbc_lover.GetHerHim]. [gbc_lover.GetHerHisCap] pealing laughter and radiating smile breaks through the numbness, like a Cupid's arrow lodging itself deep in my heart. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_104;While taking a break from dancing I have received the opportunity to converse with [gbc_lover.GetLordLady] [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]. I am not disappointed. [gbc_lover.GetHerHisCap] wit, [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] beauty, [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] charm! I do not want the moment to end, but [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] [gbc_lover.GetHusbandWifeOpp] [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] is approaching...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_106;Tonight I was visited by [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] in my dreams. When I woke up I could still hear [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] velvet voice echo in my ears and feel the comforting weight of [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] hand in mine. Oh, graceful angel! Most [gbc_lover.GetAdultCompliment]. My heart aches for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_108;By the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] had not yet left! I found [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] in the garden, taking a stroll. [gbc_lover.GetSheHeCap] let me join [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] and soon our conversation flowed as easy and pleasant as a leisurely summer's day. In the end, I had to profess my love. [gbc_lover.GetSheHeCap] rejected me most virtuously, but I could tell [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] was moved by my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_109;I must send [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] something to assure [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] of my ardent feelings. I have understood that a [gbc_lover.GetLordLady] such as [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] appreciates having poems dedicated to them. However, a fine fur never disappointed anyone, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_110;I labored throughout the evening and well into the night. However, it did pay off - the poem became even better than I could have hoped for! If anyone read this they would surely know whom it describes, even though I never mentioned [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_111;I labored throughout the evening and well into the night. No matter how I tried, I could not get the verse just right. The prose and structure turned out well, but I am not confident that I have fully captured the delicate nature of [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] qualities and my own feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_113_A;My dearest [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName], \nI was deeply moved by your most beautiful verse. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have proven to be a most noble soul. I dearly hope you will continue to bless me with your correspondence. \n\n Your faithful friend, \n[gbc_lover.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_113_B;To the esteemed [Root.GetBestName], \nI am honored by your high regard of me, my [Root.GetLordLady], but I cannot encourage you. I am not the [gbc_lover.GetManWoman] you believe me to be. I am bound by my promise, to my [gbc_lover.GetHusbandWifeOpp] and to [gbc_lover.Religion.GetHighGodName]. If you care for me at all, I wish you would abandon this folly and leave me be. \n\nMy best wishes to you and your beautiful bride, \n[gbc_lover.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_113_C;My dearest [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName], \nI send my deepest gratitude to you for the beautiful fur I received. I do not know why I would deserve such a gift, but I humbly accept. You have proven to be a most kind soul, [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName]. I hope you will continue to bless me with your correspondence. \n\n Your faithful friend, \n[gbc_lover.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_114;I have received an invitation from [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s [gbc_rival.GetHusbandWife], [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName]. [gbc_rival.GetSheHeCap] is arranging a yearly hunting trip at [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] estate and would like for me to join. [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] will surely be there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_116;It's the first eve of [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName]'s great hunt and everyone is welcomed by a great feast. The entertainment and refreshments are superb but I only have eyes for [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] seated by [gbc_rival.GetFirstName]'s side. During the evening [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] meets my gaze a handful of times, only to look away blushing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_118;It is past midnight and I am wandering the halls of the keep, searching for [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s quarters. While [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] left the feast early, [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] [gbc_rival.GetHusbandWife] was still drinking with [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] closest friends when I left. However suddenly, when I turn a corner, [gbc_rival.GetSheHe] is right there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_119;I am stalking through the underbrush, closely following my assigned hound. It seems as if it has found a trail! Then suddenly my concentration is shattered by a distant [gbc_lover.GetManWoman]'s scream. What is happening?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_121;Heart beating in my chest, I sprint through the forest. Within what must have been a minute, but felt like an hour, I burst through the thick foliage and enter a clearing. Before me [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] is kneeling on the ground, hair disheveled and horse gone. Opposite [gbc_lover.GetHerHim], and just about to strike, stands a huge wolf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_123_A;My arrow sears through the air and hits the wolf straight in the eye. As the huge gray body hits the ground, [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] turns my way. For a moment all [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] can do is stare, but then [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] stumbles across the clearing and throws [gbc_lover.GetHerselfHimself] into my arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_123_B;My arrow sears through the air, but misses the wolf with several yards. The great beast does not even flinch. Before I can draw another arrow, it launches itself at [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_123_C;All I can think of is screaming, so I do. Soon the rest of my body unfreezes and I run towards the beast, arms waving over my head. The beast is startled by my sudden appearance, and its hesitation fuels my bravery. Just before impact, it retreats. A shocked [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] stumbles into my arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_123_D;All I can think of is screaming, so I do. Soon the rest of my body unfreezes and I run towards the beast, arms waving over my head. While it is no longer staring at [gbc_lover.GetFirstName], instead it launches itself at me! One excruciating bite, and then it's gone. [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] stumbles over to me, eyes full of tears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_123_E;There is nothing I can do, it is too late. The nightmare unfolds before me. [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] cries my name in panic just before the beast pounces. Now [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] screams are nothing but wordless agony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_124;I never thought I would feel this way! I keep smiling all the time for no good reason. I want to be with [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] all the time - listen to [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] pealing laughter, hold [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] in my arms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_126;I am laying in [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s warm embrace, eyes closed, doing nothing but listening to [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] steady heartbeat. Then suddenly the perfect moment is disrupted when the door swings open, revealing a most shocked [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_128;My most beloved [Root.GetFirstName], \nI cannot believe how blessed I am, having found such a [Root.GetAdultCompliment] such as you! Yet, I write to you with a heavy heart, my dearest. Living under the same roof as my loathsome [gbc_rival.GetHusbandWife] is more than I can bear. It breaks my heart that [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] mere existence is keeping us apart! Please, [Root.GetFirstName], save me from this misery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_130;The day has arrived. Two brave hearts draw their swords but only one of them will keep beating past sunset. [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] is a worthy opponent, but today I am Fortuna's favored one. After many intense blows, I get an opening and sink my blade into [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] side. Rivulets of [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] crimson blood herald my victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_131;The day has arrived. Two brave hearts draw their swords but only one of them will keep beating past sunset. [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] is a worthy opponent, and with each exchange of blows I can feel my confidence faltering. Then a sudden attack, a missed parry, and [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] sword finds the soft flesh of my armpit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_132;At first, [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] wanted to hear none of it, as expected. The more I talked however, the more I could notice [gbc_rival.GetHerHim] softening. In the end, [gbc_rival.GetSheHe] realized that none of it could be undone. Divorcing [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] and thus giving both [gbc_rival.GetHerHim] and [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] a fresh start is the only reasonable course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_133;I did not expect it to be easy, however [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] is outright unreasonable! The more I try to explain, the redder [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] face becomes. Before I can present my strongest arguments [gbc_rival.GetSheHe] calls for the guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_134;Anxiously I have been awaiting the news all day. Did my plot succeed? Are we free, [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] and I? When the messenger enters my study, it is almost as if time itself stops. But then he gives me the joyous news - [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] is dead! I did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_135;Anxiously I have been awaiting the news all day. Did my plot succeed? Are we free, [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] and I? When the messenger enters my study I can tell right away that he brings dark tidings. He confirms my suspicions - [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] lives and [gbc_rival.GetSheHe] knows. Now [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] is outside of my reach, forever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_137;Finally, we are together, [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] and I. As it should be, as it always will be. We might have encountered obstacles along the way, yet our love is stronger for it. Now that [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s old [gbc_lover.GetHusbandWifeOpp] is out of the picture we can start over and create a new life, together. \n\nIt will not always be easy. Everyone who knows will disapprove. However, at the moment, it does not bother me in the slightest. My fear of never experiencing true love, of dying alone, is over. I have found all I will ever need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_138;[gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s face occupies my mind during all my waking hours, and [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] voice haunts my sleep at night. We have to be together! What shall I do about [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] [gbc_rival.GetHusbandWife]? I have had a few ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_140;[gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName]'s great hunt is now over. These weeks have been... eventful. To say the least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_141;Oh, great [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], have you no mercy?! It turns out that the screams I heard in the forest were [gbc_lover.GetFirstName]'s! [gbc_lover.GetSheHeCap] was savagely attacked by a wolf. When they found [gbc_lover.GetHerHim], [gbc_lover.GetHerHis] heart was still beating, yet it was too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_142;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName], \nYour filthy conduct towards my [gbc_lover.GetHusbandWife] has brought dishonor to my name. No longer can I bear it! I accept your challenge, dog. Get your affairs in order, because I shall show you no mercy! \n\n[gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_GBC_143;You walked here together, in this garden, mere months ago. Laughing at each other's quick remarks, stealing short glances... It seems like an altogether different live. Now, it's over, and it will never be the same again. \n\nMaybe being alone is not so bad. It gives you plenty of time to hone your skills and build your realm... No distractions, no limitations. What could be more important than that, after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_GBC_109;My feelings must be known, I will write a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GBC_110;I pray [gbc_lover.GetSheHe] will sense my ardent feelings through this verse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GBC_111;It is the thought that counts. I am sure [gbc_lover.GetFirstName] will agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GBC_113;I will keep writing them for you, my [gbc_lover.GetAdultCompliment]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GBC_114;Of course I'll accept! I'd do anything for just a glimpse of [gbc_lover.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_GBC_12;Oh, dear [GBC_new_friend.GetFirstName]. I'm glad you're well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_17;I thought friends talked about everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_17_TOOLTIP;You look forward to the two of you getting past this, even though the future seems uncertain right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_73;I don't know what you're talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_104;I better leave, [gbc_spouse.GetFirstName] is looking displeased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_105;This is wrong... I must forget [gbc_lover.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_109;I shall capture the essence of my love and send it to [gbc_lover.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_111;This is useless. I should just buy some gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_113;I ruined everything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_114;This won't end well. I'd better decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_116;I shouldn't push my luck. I am sure I will see [gbc_lover.GetHerHim] tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_119;I am sure it was nothing. Scared by a pheasant, perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_121;Attempt to distract the wolf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_121_TOOLTIP_A;successful distraction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_123;Uh... Let's get you back to [gbc_rival.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_124;I better join the hunt today, lest [gbc_rival.GetTitledFirstName] becomes suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_128;We knew it had to be this way. There's nothing I can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GBC_138;I must attempt to appeal to [gbc_rival.GetHerHis] better senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GR_11;We are masters of our own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_GBC_8;Take it. I was growing it tired of it anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GBC_109;A thoughtful present should prove my affections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GBC_113;I will keep writing to you, most [gbc_lover.GetAdultCompliment].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GBC_121;Do nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GBC_123;[gbc_lover.GetFirstName]? [gbc_lover.GetFirstName], no!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GBC_138;Surely I could arrange for a little... hunting accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_GBC_109;No, this has gone too far. I will not send anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
