EVTDESC_REP_002;You have just learned that the captain of one of your trade galleys has been selling part of his cargo to [rival_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] smugglers instead of delivering it as ordered, apparently hoping the amount sold would be too small to be noticed. The captain and his crew have been jailed, but the thieving scum had already spent most of their ill-gotten profits on spirits and women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_003;One of your trade galleys finally made it back to port today after being delayed for several days by a storm. Sadly, it was discovered that the ship's entire cargo had been spoiled by seawater and rendered worthless. A total loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_005;A trade galley belonging to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipping empire has been several days overdue. This morning another captain on the [rival_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] payroll came into port with flotsam from the lost ship, which he claims to have found in the wake of a recent storm. It looks like your galley was caught in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_006;A convoy of several merchant galleys belonging to your family has been ambushed by pirates on the high seas! The brigands seized two of your ships, but there is sadly little that can be done for the captured crews. They will most likely be sold as slaves along with the cargo their ships were carrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_007;A convoy flying the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] standard was ambushed by pirates today while on their way home with their holds full of precious cargo. Thanks to the quick actions of their crews, they managed to turn the tables on the pirates and capture two of their galleys! The prize money will be divided evenly, but the lion's share goes to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_008;One of your ships has returned from a foreign port with a cargo of rare spices of the very finest quality. Word has spread throughout [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], and the local nobility is already lining up at the docks, pleading for a chance to buy some of this precious cargo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_009;An enterprising captain in command of one of your galleys has discovered several new markets along foreign shores. He reports that these distant ports are rife with opportunities for trade and profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_010;To everyone's astonishment, a galley belonging to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family that was thought lost years ago slipped quietly into port last night. The ship is riddled with arrows and the sails are barely holding together, but against all odds the captain managed to bring in his cargo. He has quite a story to tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_011;The lazy, ungrateful dockworkers in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] are refusing to unload ships! Citing poor working conditions and low pay, they will not let anyone past their picket line. Troops from all of the major families are working together to quickly silence the leaders of these mobs, but costly delays in shipping are unavoidable at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_012;A large warehouse belonging to your family at the docks in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] has caught fire! The dockworkers have formed human chains and are passing buckets of water between each other to put the flames out before the fire has a chance to spread, but a lot of valuable goods have already been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_014;A wealthy local noble is looking to escape the consequences of several indiscretions on his part against a female member of the [rival_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. He has offered to pay handsomely for passage on one of your ships to a foreign port, where he can hopefully lay low for a few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_015;The dockworkers handling the loading and unloading of your ships have become quite efficient at their work. Disembarked crews are complaining that they barely have enough time to get drunk in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] before their galleys are ready to set sail again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_016;The rotting remains of a ship lost centuries ago was discovered by a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley in the port of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Divers working for your family have managed to salvage a small treasure chest containing gold bullion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_017;Ships from the republic have traveled far and wide in their relentless pursuit of trading opportunities, and as a result the accuracy of your sailors' nautical charts has been improved. Coastal waters that were previously seen as treacherous can now be navigated in relative safety, shortening the time it takes to complete certain routes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_018;There is a lot of commotion at the docks of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Apparently, the captain of one of your family's trade galleys rammed his ship into the pier while intoxicated. He was lynched by a furious crowd, but the other patrician families are holding you responsible for the damage to the dock facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_020;The captain of one of your trade galleys was fished out of the water by a ship working for the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family last week. Starved and half-mad from scurvy, the captain reports that his crew mutinied and tossed him overboard. They seem to have decided on a life of piracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_45;You have been approached by several influential burgher families from [hansa_capital.GetName]. They are seeking your blessing to establish the Hanseatic League, a trade confederation that will operate along the Empire's northern shores. By sanctioning this and turning [hansa_capital.GetName] into a Free Imperial City, you could stand to profit greatly from their trade...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_61;Several German merchant guilds and trade cities along the shores of northern Europe have come together in [k_hansa.Holder.MercRepCapital.GetName] to form the Hanseatic League with the blessing of [k_hansa.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName] of the Holy Roman Empire. This loose confederation of Free Imperial Cities is dedicated towards the continued prosperity of its members and the mutual defense of any merchant vessels flying its flag. Their eventual and unstated goal, of course, is to one day completely dominate all trade along the Baltic and North Seas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_300;The time has come for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family to [From.GetPlot]. It will serve the Republic far better in our capable hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_301;The untrustworthy scum of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family have bribed some of your merchants in an attempt to [From.GetPlot]! They are about transfer control of the Post away from your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_302;The treacherous scoundrels of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family have gathered enough support to [From.GetPlot]! The merchants there are about to transfer control of the Post away from your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_303;It seems the coffers of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family run deep... they have offered enough bribes to the merchant leaders of the Trade Post to ensure their continued loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_304;The stubborn [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] fools really want that Trade Post. They have offered an even greater bribe to its merchant leadership, who have thrown in their lot with the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_305;[From.GetTitledFirstName] of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has not only managed to match your last bribe, but also surpass it. The bidding war is over and the Trade Post remains with its previous owners. It seems that the only true winners of this sordid affair are the fat merchants running the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_306;The [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has finally seen reason and conceded defeat. The Trade Post is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_308;The treacherous scoundrels of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family have gathered overwhelming support to [From.GetPlot]! The merchants there have transferred control of the Post away from your family to their new masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_310;The power and influence of the [From.PlotTarget.Owner.GetOnlyDynastyName] family grows unchecked. I fear that their expanding trade empire represents a very real danger to the delicate balance of power within the Republic. Therefore, I request your support in my efforts to [From.GetPlot] for House [From.GetOnlyDynastyName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_311;After consulting with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that the Trade Post in [FromFrom.PlotTarget.GetName] would serve the interests of the Republic better under the supervision of the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Please make the necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth transfer of control.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_312;I will not get involved in your dispute with the [Root.PlotTarget.Owner.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. As far as I am concerned, the Trade Post can raise whichever flag its owners wish so long as the flag of the Republic flies next to it. Do not bother me with such nonsense again.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_313;You make a good point, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. I cannot permit the [Root.PlotTarget.Owner.GetOnlyDynastyName] family to absorb all power in the Republic. For the sake of the other patrician families, I have already contacted [Root.PlotTarget.Owner.GetTitledFirstName] and made certain of his cooperation in this matter. The Trade Post is yours.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_401;[dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] today announced his marriage to a woman belonging to one of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]'s smaller and less noteworthy burgher families. May they grow old and happy together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_405;[dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have fallen blindly for a bar wench he met while frequenting one of the seedier establishments in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. He has offered her his hand in marriage, and she has accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_406;[dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] has become infatuated with a young peasant girl from one of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]'s outlying farming settlements. She is apparently quite the looker, and has agreed to take his hand in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_407;Somewhat surprisingly, [dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] announced today that he is marrying the daughter of wealthy merchant family in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Though the family has little influence in the Republic, it is quite wealthy and this might explain [dynasty_member.GetFirstName]'s willingness to overlook the girl's... unique features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_409;[dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] has become quite taken with one of his serving girls. She is half his age and he is more than old enough to be her father, but he has apparently managed to woo her with gifts and kind words. Today they were united in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_411;Whispered rumors claim that [dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName] has been spending quite a bit of time with a significantly older and unmarried widow in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Today he finally announced he is in love with her, and that she has agreed to become his wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_413;Some time ago, a merchant galley working for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family brought back several visiting dignitaries from a distant land far to the south. It seems one of them, a woman, has become the target of [dynasty_member.GetTitledFirstName]'s infatuation. After courting her for weeks, she has finally agreed to marry him, take up his faith, and settle in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_REP_61;The Rise of the Hansa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_REP_002;Can no one be trusted these days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_003;Confound it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_005;The sea shall be their grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_006;Barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_007;Finally some good news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_008;The spice must flow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_009;Rule number 62... "The riskier the road, the greater the profit.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_010;Better late than never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_011;And after everything I've done for them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_012;What a disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_014;Of course. Make the arrangements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_015;Keep up the good work, men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_016;Let's see my share!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_017;You can never have too many charts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_018;That drunken fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_020;My ship and cargo... lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_45;They have my blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_61;That's bound to ruffle some feathers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_300;Commence the takeover! (100% Plot Power);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_300_tooltip;You have the needed support to supplant the Trade Post leadership with your own men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_301;Make those vipers a better offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_301_tooltip;A substantial bribe is offered to the Trade Post merchants to secure their allegience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_302;Sigh... ready some bribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_302_tooltip;You bribe the leaders of the Trade Post to remain with your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_303;Offer a larger bribe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_303_tooltip;You raise the stakes and outbribe the bribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_304;I won't give up that easily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_304_tooltip;You outbribe the counter-bribe to your previous bribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_305;Those greedy, blood-sucking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_308;Ungrateful scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_310;The [From.PlotTarget.Owner.GetOnlyDynastyName] have indeed grown too powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_311;So [FromFrom.GetFirstName] ran crying to the [From.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_312;A lot of good that did me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_313;Thank you, [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_401;I suppose congratulations are in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_406;Good for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_407;I am not surprised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_409;That sly old fox.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_411;So the rumors were true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_413;Fate brought them together, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_REP_018;An understandable mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_45;Not on my watch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_61;A new rival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_300;Commence the takeover!  (150% Plot Power);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_300_tooltip;You have gathered overwhelming support in your quest to seize the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_301;A pox on them and their children! Let them have it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_301_tooltip;The Trade Post is bought out by the rival family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_302;A pox on them and their children! Let them have it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_302_tooltip;Ownership of the Trade Post is transferred to the rival family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_303;I can't afford to stay in this bidding war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_303_tooltip;You concede defeat and the Trade Post remains with its previous owners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_304;Oh, let them have it then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_306_tooltip;You concede defeat and control of the Trade Post is transferred to its new owners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_310;As long as it flies the flag of the Republic, I care not who owns it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_REP_300;Bribe the Trade Post's merchants! (Less than 100% Plot Power);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_REP_300_tooltip;What you lack in support, you can make up for with bribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_REP_300;We must bide our time a while longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_REP_300_tooltip;You decide not to act yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_REP_300;Perhaps I should petition the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] for help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_REP_300_tooltip;You send a letter to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPREP.300;You decide to make your move against the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPREP.311;[This.GetTitledName] is informed of your decision to change ownership of the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPREP.313;[This.GetTitledName] is informed that you refuse to involve yourself in this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_REP_500;The [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has so little, while the wealth of the other patrician families grows ever larger. Surely this unfair distribution of wealth cannot be in the Republic's best interest. Would you consider transferring some Trade Posts from another family into our capable hands?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_501;Your petition is denied. If you want more Trade Posts, you will have to build them yourself. I won't let you steal the spoils of other people's hard work.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_502;The [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family is not doing well, to the detriment of the Republic as a whole. As such, I consider it my duty as [From.GetTitle] to get them back on their feet. Regretfully, this means granting them a few of your many Trade Posts. I am sure you understand the necessity of these measures.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_503;It seems I am left with little choice. I am sure the Trade Posts will suffer under their incompetent rule, but if you think this is best, I will transfer them over to this family of paupers and malcontents.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_504;Your petition has some merit, and I have decided to grant you several Trade Posts that previously belonged to the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Use them well.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_508;While I don't deny that your request has some merit, it seems there just aren't any Trade Posts available for transfer to your family. I forwarded a request on your behalf to another patrician, but he wasn't entirely... cooperative. Nevertheless, I wish you the best of luck in any future endeavors, old friend.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_510;In my continuing efforts to safeguard the security of the Republic, I think it best if my family assumed direct control over several strategic Trade Posts currently owned by House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_511;Very well. Take the Trade Posts and be damned, but know this: one day the boot will be on the other foot. Enjoy this while it lasts, my dear [Root.GetTitle].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_512;As much as I would like to comply with your demand, these Trade Posts will serve the Republic far better under my enlightened stewardship. If you wish, I can provide ample evidence of how I have improved their management. I cannot in good conscience transfer them away from my control.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_513;My dear [Root.GetFirstName], permit me to share some of my insights into the art of diplomacy. As [Root.GetTitle], you depend on the continued goodwill of the other patricians. How do you think they will react if it becomes public knowledge that you might arbitrarily confiscate their property?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_514;I'm afraid those Trade Posts will do you little good, [Root.GetTitle]. Through various means of intrigue, I have ensured the complete loyalty of all men stationed within them. They have orders to burn them to the ground if [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] rule over them is ever threatened...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_REP_500;This is not a charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_501;But... but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_502;This is outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_503;Very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_504;Thank you, most honored [From.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_508;Thanks for nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_510;The audacity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_511;Good man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_512;You win this round, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_500;Very well, let's see what we can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_510;I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_REP_510;Surely this behavior is beneath a [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_REP_510;Let's not be hasty, my dear [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_REP_070;The merchants running one of your Trade Posts have abandoned their allegiance to your dynasty! They now serve one of the patrician families in the newly born Hansa, claiming that the upstart trade league affords them better opportunities to profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_601;Money continues to flow through the Trade Post in [From.GetName], but your relationship with the merchant family that owns it has soured. To teach them a lesson without going to war, you could arrange for a mob to burn it down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_602;You and [From.GetTitledName] aren't exactly on the best of terms, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] has encouraged an angry mob to burn down your Trade Post in [trade_post_province.GetName]! Your small garrison has been surrounded, and the mob threatens to butcher them all unless you withdraw from [trade_post_province.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_603;The mob you gathered successfully stormed the Trade Post and burnt it to the ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_604;Envoys from [From.GetTitledName] have presented you with a significant bribe in the hope that you will use your influence to spare [From.GetHerHis] Trade Post in [trade_post_province.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_605;[From.GetTitledName] is quite skilled at stewardship, and [From.GetSheHe] somehow managed to sway the mob by telling them of the wealth that flows into the county through the Trade Post. The crowd has dispersed and the Trade Post remains untouched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_606;[From.GetTitledName] has skillfully used diplomacy to somehow make the mob back down! The crowd has dispersed and the Trade Post remains untouched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_607;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the vile monster [From.GetSheHe] is, took the money you offered [From.GetHerHim] as a bribe, but still did nothing to spare your Trade Post. The mob stormed the garrison and the handful of survivors who made it back to [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] have provided chilling accounts of the brutality that ensued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_070;Ingrates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_601;Yes! Assemble the mob!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_602;We have no choice. Dismantle the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_603;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_604;Good. Have the crowds dispersed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_605;Sigh. If you want something done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_607;Barbarians! Scum! Savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_601;No, things could quickly escalate out of control...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_602;Offer a bribe to [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_REP_604;Ha! The fool will lose both his money and his Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_REP_602;Point out the wealth the Trade Post brings to [trade_post_province.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_REP_602;Use skillful diplomacy to disperse the mob.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_602;An angry mob marches towards the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_604;A bribe is offered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_605;The mob disperses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_607;The Trade Post is destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
