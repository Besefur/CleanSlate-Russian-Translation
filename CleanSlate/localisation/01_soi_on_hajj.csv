EVTDESC86000;You have started to prepare yourself for going on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Soon you will humble yourself and travel in a group with others to fulfill one of the five pillars of Islam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86001;I am preparing myself for my travel to Mecca, and I have understood that there are members of my court that have not yet gone on a pilgrimage to Mecca. As [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], it is my duty to be charitable to my people, and I will bring one of them with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86010;While preparing for my pilgrimage to Mecca, I have come to realize that [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] is not a Hajjaj.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86011;My beloved [Root.GetTitle]!\n I am preparing to go to Mecca on a Hajj. Sadly, rumors tell me that you have not gone on a pilgrimage yourself. Would you like to travel with me, your faithful servant?\nYour humble [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86012;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\nI will join you on your way to Mecca!\nYour liege, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86013;I am sincerely regretful to inform you that I am not able to join you in your pilgrimage.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86015;Our liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], has heard of our plans to go to Mecca, and sends us advice that the road is perilous with infidels and bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86020;While preparing for my pilgrimage to Mecca, my child comes to me and asks if [target_child.GetSheHe] can join me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86100;I am now fully prepared for my travel to Mecca! There will be a regent ruling [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] while I am away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86101;A group of bandits are tracking us, and it seems as if they are gaining on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86102;It is not possible to outrun these bandits, and we are forced to confront them. There is always the possibility that we can survive this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86105;Travelling by sea causes you to feel seasick. Luckily there is a hafiz on the ship who quotes the holy Qur'an. 'And they shall be made to drink therein a cup the admixture of which shall be ginger'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86110;As you travel over the sea, your ship spots the sails of a well-known [christian.GetGroupName] pirate. We have a faster ship, and the chance to eliminate this threat to pilgrims forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86150;Nearby you see how a group of bandits have encircled a group of fellow pilgrims. It is very likely they will rob and kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86151;We got surrounded by bandits, and I was sure that I was soon going to be robbed and left for dead, when some fellow pilgrims arrived to save us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86160;One of my servants have noticed that a hated rival is camping not far from us. I know that it is against the teachings of the prophet to attack someone on Hajj, but this is a golden opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86161;We have been ambushed, and it seems as if it is [From.GetTitledName] who is attempting to kill you. It is an outrage, and it clear that [From.GetSheHe] is not a proper Muslim to attempt such a vile act in the darkness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86162;Our ambush ended in disaster... Not only did [From.GetTitledName] get away, but [From.GetSheHe] also injured me severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86163;Success!\nI've left [From.GetTitledName], bleeding severely, to die in the desert...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86164;It seems that [From.GetTitledName] got away in the quiet of the night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86165;A messenger comes with an invitation from [From.GetTitledName] who is camped not far from us, offering to break bread and reconcile our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86166;[From.GetTitledName] has joined our camp and we are breaking bread together, reconciling our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86167;Honorable [Root.GetTitledName]!\nI regret to inform you that I will not be able to break bread with you today, as I need to break camp immediately.\n\n[From.GetTitledName] ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86170;Travelling to Mecca gives time for reflection. A [Root.GetManWoman] should not go into excess when it comes to food, and should always abstain from wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86180;It seems as if we have managed to get lost here in the desert. One of the humble servants seems as if he might know the right way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86300;As you stop for camp one evening, you notice that an old man in poor clothing has made camp at the same place. The man offers to tell you a hadith he has if you can spare him some bread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86320;The old man starts telling you that Ka'b ibn Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said 'Two hungry wolves loose among sheep do not cause as much damage as that caused to a man's deen by his greed for money and reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86330;The old man says that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would often pray, 'O Allah! I seek your protection from anxiety and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from stinginess and cowardice, and from the burden of debt and the domination of people.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86340;The old man says that, Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Beware of envy. Envy devours good actions as fire devours wood.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86350;The old man says that, Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Truthfulness leads to piety and piety leads to the Garden. A [Root.GetManWoman] should be truthful until [Root.GetSheHe] is written down as truthful in the sight of Allah. Lying leads to deviance and deviance leads to the Fire. A person lies to the point that [Root.GetSheHe] is written down as a liar in the sight of Allah.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86360;The old man quotes the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Sunan Abu Dawood, "The most evil traits in a [Root.GetManWoman] are severe stinginess and uninhibited cowardice!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86380;The old man starts telling you, that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said.. "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'If people see an unjust person, and do not restrain [Root.GetHerHim], Allah is very likely to seize them with retribution from Him.'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86390;The old man says, "As the holy Qur'an says, 'You desire the attractions of this world, but Allah desires the next world for you!', and 'Yes, you prefer the life of this world, but the next world is better and more lasting.'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86400;The old man says, As related by Al-Tirmidhi, "I said, O Prophet of Allah, will we be held accountable for what we say? He said, 'May your mother be bereft of you! Is there anything that topples people on their faces into the hellfire other than the jests of their tongues?'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86410;The old man says that Abu Hurairah heard the prophet say "When Allah decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: 'My mercy prevails over My wrath'.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86510;As you arrive in Mecca you start preparing for the evening's prayer when you discover that the water in the well is not entirely pure. This would not be valid water to use for ablution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86511;While performing wudu before the night's prayer, a fellow pilgrim points out an impurity in the water!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86520;As you arrive in Mecca, you change from your travelling clothes and dress in the white ihram clothing. This cloth is intended to make everyone appear the same, as in the eyes of Allah there is no difference between a [Root.GetTitle] and a pauper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86550;You are now at Kabah itself, and performing the Tawaf. Seven circuits you will walk around the black stone, and each time you complete a circuit you point to the stone and say 'In the name of Allah, Allah is Great, Allah is Great, Allah is Great and praise be to Allah'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86600;Performing the Sa'i involved running seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah. This is done to remember the search for water by Ishmael's mother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86610;The ninth day in Mecca you perform the Wuquf at Mount Arafat, with the entire afternoon dedicated to contemplative vigil, praying, and reciting the holy Qur'an.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86620;When Abraham left Mina and was brought down to al-Aqaba, the Devil appeared to him. Gabriel said to him: 'Pelt him!' so Abraham threw seven stones at him so that he disappeared from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86630;To symbolize the mercy God had for Abraham, and replacing his son Ishmael with a ram, which Abraham then sacrificed, we perform the Eid al-Adha while at Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86700;A group of bandits have forced our party to make a stand. We are outnumbered, but with the joy in our heart from our pilgrimage, we have a chance to defeat them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86701;We accidentally ran into a group of bandits at nightfall, and the guards that I had hired to protect my group proved their worth. All of the infidel bandits have been slain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86720;As you travel back home from Mecca you encounter a very poor village, where even the richest seem to starve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86800;I have returned to my court a changed man. I am truly humbled before Allah, and I know that all men are equal and can live in harmony with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86810;The ship you are on falls victim to a mighty storm, and you are tossed overboard as it sinks beneath the waves. Together with your followers and a few other survivors, you are washed ashore on a small, deserted island. As a person of rank, it falls on you to distribute what little food you have left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86811;After a few days another ship carrying pilgrims passes nearby, and to everyone's relief their lookout spots your stranded party. Though weakened by the lack of food and water, everyone survives thanks to your decision to share supplies evenly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86812;After a few days another ship carrying pilgrims passes nearby, and to everyone's relief their lookout spots your stranded party. For some of the survivors it is too late, but at least you are in good health, as, befitting of your great station, the lion's share of water and food has gone to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86815;You take passage on a ship, but the crew is soon exposed as less than honorable. The captain is overheard discussing how he and his men will sell the pilgrims he is carrying, including you, into slavery at the next port!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86816;Together with the other pilgrims, you turn against the crew and a fierce struggle ensues. The battle ends when you run your blade through the treacherous captain's gut and the rest of the crew surrenders. The ship is under your command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86817;As the ship approaches the port, you and your party quietly slip away into the water, and swim ashore some distance away from the docks as drenched but free men. The other pilgrims on the ship are not so fortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86820;You are fortunate to encounter a large, well-guarded caravan heading in the same direction as you. After joining with them you encounter several bandit groups as you journey forward, but they all scatter at the sight of the caravan, preferring instead to prey on smaller bands of pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86825;You are not far from your goal now, but you and your party are running short on water. A detour to a nearby oasis to replenish your supplies is necessary, but when you arrive it becomes obvious the well dried out many years ago...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86826;As you sit down in prayer, you spot another caravan far away in the distance. Though you suspect it may be another mirage, you decide to follow it and they eventually lead you to the real oasis, slightly southeast of where you thought it would be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86827;Overcome with anger and despair, you pick up a large rock and throw it in a rage over the crest of a nearby dune. A loud scream is heard from the other side, and as you cross over the crest you find the real oasis, with glittering, crystal-clear water... and an unconscious bedouin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86830;The journey through the desert is long and arduous under the scorching sun. Suddenly a large tea house materializes into thin air before your very eyes, and the singing djinn who seems to own the establishment beckons you inside. Strangely, your travelling companions do not take notice of this stunning event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86835;The camel one of your companions is riding on collapses on the sand with a grunt, never to rise again. You could take turns with your companion to ride on your camel, but that would slow you down, and the unforgiving sun would have to be endured a while longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86840;As you draw closer to Mecca, you spot an almost endless baggage train belonging to another ruler who seems to have decided to bring all the luxuries of his court along with him on his pilgrimage. As you pass his carriage together with your party, the driver, unaware of your station, curses at you to get out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86845;Your small party comes across a single robed figure surrounded by a group of angry bandits in the desert. Things could turn ugly unless you intervene...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86846;A fierce melee ensues, and several of the brigands are cut down by the robed figure, who reveals himself to be an able fighter. After the rest are dealt with by your party, the robed man bows before you. He hands you a ring with a strange carved symbol, but before you can ask its meaning he takes off into the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86850;As you ride through the desert on your way home, you pass the grim remains of another pilgrim caravan. Their bones have been picked clean by scavengers and it serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers associated with the Hajj. You consider yourself lucky to have made it as far as you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86855;While journeying home, you are caught in the open desert by a terrible sandstorm. You are forced to seek shelter behind a small rock outcropping to shield yourself from the wind. Taking comfort in your faith after visiting Mecca, you spend the night in prayer. As dawn arrives, you feel almost invigorated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86860;You catch up with some fellow pilgrims who are also returning home from the Hajj. They have been beset by bandits who have stolen everything but their clothes and left them with no means to continue the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86865;You are ambushed by brigands as you move through the desert on your way home, and though your party cuts down several of their number, there are simply too many. They surround you and advance with twisted grins and drawn weapons. Things look bleak indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86866;A strange whistle is heard and the air is suddenly filled with flying daggers and arrows. Robed figures seem to rise out of the sand and the air becomes heavy with dust. When it settles, the bandits lie dead on the ground. One of the robed men takes the strange ring you were given earlier, saying with a smile: "The Hashshashin always repay their debts, friend.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86902;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is reminding you that you had promised to liberate good [muslim.GetGroupName] living under [christian.GetGroupName] rule, and there still exists such in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86900;A local Imam is berating you as you are getting older and have not yet been on hajj, which is expected of every Muslim once in [Root.GetHerHis] life. [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] says that as a ruler, I should be an example for my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC86901;[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is reminding you that you have promised to go to Mecca, and that while Allah is merciful in His wisdom, you have indeed promised Him to go on a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA86000;All are equal in front of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86001;It will make travel more enjoyable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86010;Berate [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86011;I will prepare myself immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86012;Allah is Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86013;Allah will judge him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86015;Bring guards with you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86020;Bring [target_child.GetHerHim] along;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86100;Onwards to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86101;Attempt to avoid them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86102;They are few enough to defeat alone..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86105;I feel good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86110;It's too great of a risk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86150;There is nothing we can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86151;My brother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86160;Attempt to ambush him in the night..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86161;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86162;[From.GetTitledName] got the best of me..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86163;[From.GetSheHeCap] will surely die soon enough..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86164;It can't be helped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86165;We are allies in the faith after all..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86166;Subhan'Allah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86167;We have lost face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86170;I shall be more moderate in my eating..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86180;I am [Root.GetTitle]! I know the best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86300;Listen to the old man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86320;Greed is against Islam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86330;I bow my head and say the same prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86340;Envy harms myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86350;I should be with the truthful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86360;And I am no evil [Root.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86380;Allah commands to justice and doing good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86390;This is wisdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86400;I will think more on what I say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86410;This is wisdom I was not aware of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86510;Inform others nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86511;Cleanliness is half of faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86520;I am humbled....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86550;Shout at every circuit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86600;I feel invigorated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86610;I feel like I understand more now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86620;Stone the Jamarat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86630;Sacrifice a ram.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86700;These infidels will shatter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86701;Their loot can come to use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86720;I must help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86800;There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86810;We will share evenly, as brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86811;Now we can all continue to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86812;Let us pay no heed to this little setback. Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86815;That will not come to pass. To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86816;Set sail for Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86817;At least now we can continue our journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86820;Cowardly scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86825;We must have faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86826;Allah be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86827;Well... who would have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86830;A mirage... my mind is playing tricks on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86835;Here, use my mount for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86840;We are all equal before Allah, friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86845;Stand aside, brigands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86846;How peculiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86850;We will soon be home, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86855;I will remember this night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86860;Here. This should be enough to see you safely home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86865;Come then. I will sell myself dearly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86866;Then consider the debt repaid in full.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86900;I will soon go to Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86901;I am not a good Muslim...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA86902;I am not a good Muslim...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB86001;It is too costly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86010;Clearly, [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is a busy [Root.Liege.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86011;I am too busy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86015;Travel lightly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86020;It would be too costly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86101;Its our duty to stop them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86102;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86110;We must stop these infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86150;Attempt to rescue them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86160;Befriend him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86161;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86165;Politely Decline...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86170;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86180;Listen to the servant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86300;It is just an old man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86320;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86330;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86340;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86350;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86360;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86380;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86390;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86400;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86410;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86550;Only shout the first three times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86630;Sacrifice a lamb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86700;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86720;I can't afford to help them all..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86810;As [Root.GetTitle], my share will be greatest of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86815;We will sneak off the ship just before it docks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86825;Haha... of course the well is dry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86830;Last one inside buys the first round of tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86835;Terrible luck, friend... see you in Mecca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86845;It is no concern of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86860;Sorry, but I cannot afford to dally. Best of luck to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB86900;I am busy preparing a jihad, to liberate fellow Muslims!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC86102;Pay them with our remaining gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC86160;I'll just ignore him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC86161;We got enough time to run away..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC86900;I am busy being [Root.County.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP86011;[This.GetTitledName] will listen to us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86012;[This.GetTitledName] will be travelling together with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86013;[This.GetTitledName] will be disappointed in me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86102;I and my group of pilgrims will engage the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86161;[This.GetTitledName] will face our steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86162;[This.GetTitledName] is left for dead in the night..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86165;[This.GetTitledName] will hear our invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86166;Bread is shared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86167;Informed you will not join him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86511;[This.GetTitledName] will be grateful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86811;You share the food evenly with the other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86812;Most of the supplies are reserved for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86816;Mutiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86817;You flee the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86826;Sit down in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86827;Give in to despair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86846;Save the robed figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP86866;You make your last stand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TOOLTIP_LISTEN_TO_HADITH;You listen carefully to the old man's hadith.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
