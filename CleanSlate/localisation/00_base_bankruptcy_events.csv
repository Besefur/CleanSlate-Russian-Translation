EVTDESC38000;My coffers are empty and I've already borrowed money from my friends. Perhaps it is time to approach the moneylenders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38001;I am informed by the moneylenders that the loan is due...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38002;The moneylenders are here, reminding me of that loan I took...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38010;My coffers are empty, but the coffers of my vassals are full. They have an obligation to their liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is requesting help with [From.GetHerHis] mismanagement of the economy. We are asked to provide a certain amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to pay us the gold we need. Perhaps we should have [From.GetHerHim] arrested?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has paid us the money we asked [From.GetHerHim] for. This is definitely what we needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38016;[From.GetTitledName] approved your request but [From.GetSheHe] made sure to emphasize that this action is a favor to you and that you should remember it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38020;My coffers are empty, but the Church is rich! Maybe I should seize church properties to repay my debts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38021;There is a place in hell for sinners such as [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Never in the history of Christendom has such a vile ruler existed, one who robs the Holy Church itself of its belongings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38022;An emissary from the Holy Father has come to our court, to announce that we are anathema to everything that is holy. We have been excommunicated! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38050;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is faithful as long as it gets paid. But we are, after all, mercenaries. We owe [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA] no oath of fealty, and so we have decided to reclaim a little of what is owed us. Forcefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38051;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The irregularity of pay recently has made the men restless. Regrettably, I share their sentiments. The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] must cease its service to you immediately, due to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]'s inability to fulfill the contractual obligations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38052;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Due to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]'s lack of regular payment, the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has decided to seek more gainful employment elsewhere, perhaps among the other participants in this war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38053;To the great [Root.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetTitledFirstName] of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The inability of our previous employer to provide our contractual pay has caused us to look for employment elsewhere. We would serve [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA] if you would have us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38054;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Due to your crimes against the True Faith, we can no longer serve you. You should repent and seek guidance from [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38060;My liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], is in deep financial trouble. As my coffers are filled, this seems like a golden opportunity to acquire more land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38061;[From.GetTitledName] has recognized the dire financial situation I am in. [From.GetSheHeCap] has sent me an offer to buy some land of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC38062;[From.GetTitledName] offers to help you out with your financial situation. [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to aquire some land in exchange for a very generous sum of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA38002;300 gold? Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38010;Ask for 250 gold..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38020;There are fat bishops, seize them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38021;[From.GetSheHeCap] is cursed in the eyes of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38022;We have been judged in the eyes of God...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38050;Curse his name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38051;It could have been worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38052;That blackguard will get his just deserts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38053;How opportune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA38054;Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
