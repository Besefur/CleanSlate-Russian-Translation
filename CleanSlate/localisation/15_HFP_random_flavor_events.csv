EVTDESC_HF_2;My giant body has given me troubles since I was born, and now I have grown to the point where I can barely walk without assistance. I am lucky to still have the strength to lift my own head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_3;Since I was a mere child my body has been growing and growing, and with its growth I have constantly trained it. I now stand an imposing figure, not only tall like a mountain - but also with muscles like a [Root.GetRegionalFerociousAnimal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_4;As I get older and older my body will just not stop its incessant growth! My skin is getting thicker, my voice is becoming deeper, my limbs hurt and I have a headache that just will not go away. While my immense stature is more imposing than ever, I feel my spirit slowly leaving my body...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_2;No - from now on I will work out every day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_3;How is the weather down there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_4;How long am I for this world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_2;Why is [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] playing this cruel trick on me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_30000;[concerned_relative.GetFirstName] grabbed the bottle out of my hand as I reached for more wine and hurled it against the wall. "You're killing yourself!", [concerned_relative.GetSheHe] shouted, tears in [concerned_relative.GetHerHis] eyes. "Stop drinking, for your family's sake.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30002;[concerned_relative.GetFirstName] passed away recently and though [concerned_relative.GetSheHe] is not around to make sure I don't drink anymore, maybe I should stop to respect [concerned_relative.GetHerHis] memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30003;After hardly touching a drop of alcohol for weeks, [concerned_relative.GetFirstName] pointed out how much healthier I appear these days. "You look so much better". ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30004;I woke up today craving a drink more than anything. I feel absolutely terrible, but I won't give up. [concerned_relative.GetFirstName] would never forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30005;I tried to stop I really did, but I found a bottle that had been left out one night and drunk it all down. No one would have known if the servant hadn't told [concerned_relative.GetFirstName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30010;Due to my massive size I am constantly hitting my head on every door I go through, much to the amusement of anyone passing by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30020;"I know you've been feeling down recently" my court physician [physician.GetFirstName] said to me, "Try drinking this it could help, though there are some risks involved". The grey concontion smells vaguely of ash, not the most appealing prospect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30100;The heavens briefly lit up and the ground shook as the rock from the sky crashed into the castle gardens. I sent my men to investigate and they came back with a lump of a curious metal we have not seen before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_30102;It has been a few weeks since the great rock from the sky landed in my gardens, and the weapon that I ordered forged from the metal is complete. I look upon the sword with wonder – all the way from the heavens and now in my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFPA30032;It was hard to notice at first, but now there can be no doubts about it: my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is left-handed. It might be prudent to correct this behavior before it becomes permanent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA30033;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is furious with me for some reason. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that I should always use my right hand whenever I do something, or [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] will be mad at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA30034;[From.GetFirstName], that devious little brat, has fooled me into believing [From.GetSheHe] had stopped using [From.GetHerHis] right hand. Only this morning I overheard [From.GetHerHim] flaunting [From.GetHerHis] trickery with [From.GetHerHis] playmates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA30035;A conscientious [From.GetBoyGirl], [From.GetFirstName] has decided to obey my order and force [From.GetHerselfHimself] to become right-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPA30036;The gall on [From.GetFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] outright refused to listen to me, and insists on using [From.GetHerHis] left hand for everything [From.GetSheHe] does!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB30032;It was hard to notice at first, but now there can be no doubts about it: my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is left-handed. This sort of deviancy should not be allowed to take root, lest it encourages more ungodly behaviors later in [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFPB30033;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] told me that I should try to always use my right hand instead of the left. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that it will help me in many ways when I am older.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_30000;I will try to change, for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30000_TT;You will try to stop drinking, but there is a chance you become unwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30002;I will never touch another drop in their honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30003;I did it for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30004;This is meant to be good for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30005;I just can't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30010;I guess I'll just wait until nobody is around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30020;Anything to feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_30020_TT;You drink the potion, despite the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP30032;The left hand is of the Devil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP30033;Sure, [GetFromRelation]! (Lie);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP30034;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP30036;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_30000;How dare you tell me what to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_30000_TT;You make no attempt to stop drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_30002;I need the drink to cope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_30010;It hurts but that just builds character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_30020;No way am I drinking that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP30032;Using your right hand is much more practical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP30033;Alright, [GetFromRelation]. I will do like you say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP30032;The child is fine like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP30033;No! I like using the left hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16002;After many years of preparation, [From.GetBestName] has chosen to declare complete sovereignty over [From.GetHerHis] vast territories by founding the Tsardom of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16006_armor;I have recently inherited [inherited_artifact.GetName], a piece of armor, from [previous_owner.GetTitledFirstName]. "I am not sure it's in any wearable condition, my [Root.GetLordLady]" the quartermaster informs me, as I trace the pattern on it with one hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16006_book;"My [Root.GetLordLady], something has been found in the [inherited_artifact.GetArtifactStorage]" a scribe catches up with me. "An old book, from [previous_owner.GetTitledFirstName]?" When I join [Root.GetHerHim] for a closer inspection, I have to agree with the assessment. "Old indeed", I sneeze. "We should have someone care for it", the scribe suggests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16006_child;"What is it?" I ask the guards. "You have inherited this... [inherited_artifact.GetName]", one of them explains. "From [previous_owner.GetTitledFirstName]", [Root.GetSheHe] continues. "If you want to keep it, we'll store it for you, [Root.GetMasterMistress]. It might need some maintenance though.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16006_quality_2;I have recently inherited [inherited_artifact.GetName] from [previous_owner.GetTitledFirstName]. It is not in good shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16006_quality_3;The [inherited_artifact.GetArtifactStorage] currently houses a valuable item I inherited from [previous_owner.GetTitledFirstName]. It might need someone to look after it though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_16001;All shall bow to [Root.GetBestName]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16002;That hardly sounds necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_1_A;I suppose it could be worth something, one day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_1_B;For sentimental reasons, I could have someone look it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_2_A;I'll pay to maintain it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_2_B;Maintenance is to be expected, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_16006_1;Looks rather useless to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHFP20800_BROOD_UNCOUTH_ED;With [From.GetFirstName] spending most of [From.GetHerHis] days cloistered, is it surprising that [From.GetSheHe] has such a poor care of [From.GetHerHis] looks? The [From.GetBoyGirl] always looks like a vagabond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_BROOD_UNCOUTH_RESP;[From.GetFirstName] scolded me about my lack of grooming. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that, regardless of my cloistered lifestyle, I should still strive to maintain the dignified look of a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
