EVTDESC_RIP_4010;As you are working, Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] bursts into your study. "My [Root.GetTitle], you have been up all night again! It would be in your best interest to not work so hard, lest you shall collapse from exhaustion!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4011;As you wake up one morning you are greeted by a dog's wet nose touching your face. The voice of Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] shortly follows, "My [Root.GetTitle], I have personally trained this beast to lead you wherever you need to go! Please, accept her as a gift from me to you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4012;One day after waking, your loyal guide dog is not there to greet you. You find yourself fumbling down the stairs unassisted in order to reach the spot where you know she sleeps. Sadly, after reaching her, she is not waking up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4013;You are deep in thought as Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] suddenly interrupts you, "My [Root.GetTitle], I know that both you and the [Root.Spouse.GetTitle] desire an heir for the realm. If you so wish, I could research ways to enhance your virility, all in order to facilitate the creation of a worthy successor!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4015;Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] firmly pats you on the shoulder as [physician_target.GetSheHe] enters. "I have done some research, and you should not worry! Wait another moon and you shall see that your seed has taken root.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4016;Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] approaches you with a smile on [physician_target.GetHerHis] face. "I have succeeded, my [Root.GetTitle]! If you drink this concoction your potency will magnify tenfold, the royal bloodline is saved!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4017;Shortly after drinking the concoction, you feel a pleasant mist clouding your senses. As you emerge from the blur you find yourself in the royal bedchamber, and not alone! It seems as if the concoction might have been a tad TOO effective!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4018;Shortly after drinking the concoction you feel full of energy and vigor! It seems to have worked, the lineage is surely saved now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4019;The concoction was supposed to work in "Three easy steps!" and have an "Instantaneous effect!" according to Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName]... but you are not feeling it. In fact, you feel LESS virile than ever before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4020;Your friend, Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName], is always hard at work researching. Bubbling cauldrons, colorful exotic herbs, sharpened glistening tools and all manner of other interesting things fill [physician_target.GetHerHis] study... It is all rather intriguing, perhaps you could learn something if you were to join [physician_target.GetHerHim] for a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4021_BAD;You attempt to follow [physician_target.GetFirstName] in [physician_target.GetHerHis] work, but it doesn't take long before the intense fumes permeating [physician_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory gets to you. After only a few hours you have to evacuate, and you have got a splitting headache! At least you learned something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4021_EXCELLENT;The days pass as you observe and study the work of [physician_target.GetFirstName]. After but a few days YOU are the one teaching [physician_target.GetHerHim] what to do! [physician_target.GetFirstName] doesn't seem upset, but rather seems overjoyed to be able to work with someone of a matching intellect. It doesn't take long before you manage to brew a surprisingly invigoration potion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4021_GOOD;The days pass as you observe and study the work of [physician_target.GetFirstName]. You dissect small animals, brew potions and take endless notes - and have a blast doing so! [physician_target.GetFirstName] enjoyed your presence, and you seem to have learned something to boot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4021_MIDDLING;You spend a few days observing [physician_target.GetFirstName]'s work. You don't understand much, but [physician_target.GetSheHe] still attempts to show and teach you what [physician_target.GetSheHe]'s doing. It seems as if you learned something after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4021_TERRIBLE;You barely make it into [physician_target.GetFirstName]'s lab before you stumble and tip over an entire table of surgeon's tools! Some of the sharpened blades tear your skin and cause you to bleed. [physician_target.GetFirstName] hurries to patch you up, but the wound won't stop bleeding, perhaps the blade was covered in something foul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4022;As you ponder new ways to improve your realm, Court Physician [physician_target.GetFirstName] approaches you with an idea. "My [Root.GetTitle], if you were to institute a system of provincial apothecaries, the health of your subjects would improve significantly! In turn, they are sure to be more productive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4030;My court physician [physician.GetTitledFirstName] has shared some of [physician.GetHerHis] latest ideas with me. I do not know much of medicine, but perhaps [physician.GetSheHe] is on to something. [physician.GetSheHeCap] has asked for some money to develop [physician.GetHerHis] theory further and write a book on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4031;My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] has most graciously offered me [From.GetHerHis] patronage. I have been given a sum of money to do medical research and [From.GetFirstName] expects me to write a book on my findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_4032_GOOD;[physician.GetTitledFirstName] has published the results from [physician.GetHerHis] medical investigations. The book has not received any notable attention but at least [physician.GetFirstName] has developed [physician.GetHerHis] skills as a physician.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4032_GREAT_1;[physician.GetTitledFirstName] has published [physician.GetHerHis] work on the four humors.

EVTDESC_RIP_4032_GREAT_3;[physician.GetTitledFirstName] has published [physician.GetHerHis] work on miasma. [physician.GetHerHisCap] ideas about how corrupted air emanates from rotting organic matter and causes different diseases have been received with much acclaim by scholars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4032_MEH;[physician.GetTitledFirstName] has published the results from [physician.GetHerHis] medical investigations. The book has not received any notable attention. It is just gathering dust in my library...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4033_BAD;Finally I had published the book on my new theories, my gift to the world of medicine, but the other scholars simply laughed in my face! They say people across the realm read my book as entertainment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4033_GOOD;I have published the results from my medical investigations. Unfortunately the book has not received any notable attention, but I know I am onto something. In any case this work has taught me some valuable new skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_4041_BOOKS;My court physician [physician.GetTitledFirstName] has suggested that I buy [physician.GetHerHim] some books on anatomy and herbalism so that [physician.GetSheHe] can improve [physician.GetHerHis] skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_4046_BOOKS;My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] thought it would be a nice idea to buy me some books on anatomy and herbalism, however the ones I received seem ancient! I am already familiar with the greater part of the material and the rest seems absurd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4046_HERBS;My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] thought it would be a good idea to buy me some herbs, however as soon as I received the package I realized that [From.GetSheHe] had been tricked. It contained nothing but dried common grass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4046_LAB_EQUIPMENT;My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to award me with some "new" equipment for my laboratory, but these things are anything but. I can tell with a single glance that some instruments are outright dangerous to use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4046_TOOLS;My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to award me with some "new" surgical tools, but the ones I received must be ancient. Anything that should be sharp is dull and that which needs to be sturdy is brittle. One tool literally broke in my hand during surgery yesterday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4047_BOOKS;My court physician [From.GetTitledFirstName] has reluctantly let me know that the new books I bought [From.GetHerHim] were ancient and contained nothing of value. Apparently some of the methods they describe are outright deadly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_4047_TOOLS;My court physician [From.GetTitledFirstName] has reluctantly let me know that the surgical tools I bought [From.GetHerHim] were old, brittle and dull. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] performed a surgery yesterday which ended badly due to a faulty tool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4060;Thanks to my liege [physician_liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s generous patronage, I have become a renowned physician. People come from far and wide to seek my assistance and scholars throughout the realm praise my methods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4061;Thanks to my generous patronage, my court physician [physician.GetTitledFirstName] has become renowned for [physician.GetHerHis] talents.

EVTDESC_RIP_4100;A man is brought in shackles before you, apparently he is a missionary from [origin_realm_of_missionary_physician_target.Realm.GetName] who has been preaching his heretical faith among your people! He claims to be on a mission from [missionary_physician_target.Religion.GetHighGodName], and has been caring for the sick in nearby villages. What should be done about this misguided [missionary_physician_target.Religion.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4101;The weeks pass and your [missionary_physician_target.Religion.GetName] court physician keeps talking about his religion. He is even claiming that [missionary_physician_target.Religion.GetRandomGodName] could grant you health and a long life! It almost sounds too good to be true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4300;Lots of peasants have been moving to the county of [prosperity_target.GetName] lately. Your [Root.GetTreasurerName], [councillor_target.GetFullName], suggests building new roads in order to make it easier for the peasants to reach the central holdings. [councillor_target.GetSheHeCap] insists that in doing so the county would become more prosperous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4301;The peasants in [prosperity_target.GetName] spend a long time on the road in order to meet with the [prosperity_target.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s, or so your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [councillor_target.GetFirstName] claims. [councillor_target.GetSheHeCap] suggests that it would be in your interests to construct local shrines, in that way the peasants would not have to travel far in order to worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4302;According to your [Root.GetMarshalName], [councillor_target.GetFullName], the peasants of [prosperity_target.GetName] are having frequent troubles with highwaymen and wild beasts. [councillor_target.GetSheHeCap] suggests constructing a series of outposts along the roads of [prosperity_target.GetName]. The peasantry would feel much safer, and it might even lead to more peasants moving to the county!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4303;The peasants of [prosperity_target.GetName] are quite far apart and spread out. Your [Root.GetSpymasterName], [councillor_target.GetFullName], suggests investing in a provincial messenger system so that they can communicate with their kin more easily. [councillor_target.GetSheHeCap] claims that doing so would attract more peasants to the county!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4304;According to [Root.GetChancellorName] [councillor_target.GetFirstName], the peasants of [prosperity_target.GetName] have started a delightful tradition where the peasantry from several villages meet up and dance, feast and pair up for future marriage. By promoting this tradition [councillor_target.GetFirstName] believes that the county will develop a strong local culture that will attract more peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_4305;Being such an industrious ruler you have not gone unnoticed by the population of [prosperity_target.GetName].

EVTDSC_RIP_29003;I am not sure why, but I expected to find solitude at [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s grave. How I was mistaken! Unfortunately I ran into [rip_dead.GetHerHis] old [rip_widow.GetHusbandWife] [rip_widow.GetTitledFirstName]. I had hoped [rip_widow.GetSheHe] would be civil, but instead [rip_widow.GetSheHe] made a scene, screeching so loudly that the [rip_dead.Religion.GetPriestTitle] had to calm [rip_widow.GetHerHim] down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29004;Thanks to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s great mercy, there were no other visitors at [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s grave when I arrived. I spent several hours mere yards from [rip_dead.GetHerHis] cold body, contemplating the fragility of life and love. When I returned to my chambers, as if by a sign sent from [rip_dead.GetFirstName], I found [rip_dead.GetHerHis] lucky charm on the floor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29005;I always imagined I would be the first of us to go, but now I am the one mourning the departure of my dear friend. Never again will I hear [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s jolly laugh or receive [rip_dead.GetHerHis] wise council. It is as if I have lost an essential part of myself. I feel so powerless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29006;I am at the local tavern, drowning my sorrows over my friend [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s recent passing, when I notice another unhappy patron. Surely it must be [From.GetFirstName], an old companion of [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s? Maybe I should keep [From.GetHerHim] company?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29007_A;I have probably already had one drink too many when I am joined at the table by an equally intoxicated [From.GetManWoman]. It takes me a few minutes to realize, but surely it must be [From.GetTitledFirstName], another old friend of [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s! We spend quite some time reminiscing about our old comrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29007_B;I have probably already had one drink too many when I am joined at the table by an equally intoxicated [From.GetManWoman]. It takes me a few minutes to realize, but surely it must be [From.GetTitledFirstName]! We spend quite some time drinking together and sharing our sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29008;Why, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]? How could you be so cruel and take [rip_dead.GetFirstName] from me?! I can find no relief, no escape from the all-consuming sorrow. No matter how many bottles I empty, all I can see before me is [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s pale and lifeless face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29009_A;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent all evening reminiscing about [rip_dead.GetFirstName] and indeed, today my heart feels a lot lighter! Hopefully this is the start of a wonderful new friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29009_B;The world isn't such a bad place after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29010;Haha! [Root.GetSheHeCap] who laughs last laughs longest! Finally that [GetRootFromInsult] [rip_dead.GetTitledFirstName] has left this fine Earth. While everything will definitely be better without [rip_dead.GetHerHim], I have a lot of extra time on my hands now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29011;I am almost at the grave of my deceased [rip_dead.GetHusbandWife] [rip_dead.GetFirstName] when I hear a wet, thudding sound. How strange! I hurry around the corner to discover the source. The scene I am met with is gruesome beyond words – [From.GetTitledFirstName], gore up to [From.GetHerHis] elbows, my [rip_dead.GetHusbandWife]'s severed head in [From.GetHerHis] hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29012_A;I have just separated [rip_dead.GetTitledFirstName]'s head from [rip_dead.GetHerHis] body when the door is thrown open by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Before I have a chance to explain myself, [From.GetSheHe] calls for the guards and I am hauled off to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29012_B;I have just separated [rip_dead.GetTitledFirstName]'s head from [rip_dead.GetHerHis] body when the door is thrown open by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Before I have a chance to explain myself, [From.GetSheHe] calls for the guards and I am thrown out, head first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29013;Finally, with one last swing of the cleaver, [rip_dead.GetTitledFirstName]'s ugly head is severed from [rip_dead.GetHerHis] equally disgusting body! I roll it up in a piece of cloth, stash it in my satchel and escape undetected into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29014;The guards have brought you some most disturbing news. During the night, someone has broken into [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s grave! As if that was not enough, the sick culprit also severed [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s head from [rip_dead.GetHerHis] body and stole it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29015;Since the death of my dear [rip_dead.GetFirstName] I have been debating matters of life and death with my most trusted [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s. While I refused to accept their arguments at first, they have started to make sense as of late. Perhaps [rip_dead.GetFirstName] is in a better place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29016;After the death of [rip_dead.GetFirstName], people have tried to comfort me, but I never felt that they truly understood. Now I tend to avoid them and their idle chatter. However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a gorgeous black and white cat. It never presumes to know my feelings or pesters me with unwelcome advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29019;Ever since the death of [rip_dead.GetFirstName] I have been so very lonely. There is no one quite like [rip_dead.GetHerHim] in my life any more. However, the other day when I was watching the children play, my [rip_child.GetSonDaughter] [rip_child.GetFirstName] said something which reminded me so much of [rip_dead.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29020;Before my dear friend [rip_dead.GetTitledFirstName] passed from this world, [rip_dead.GetSheHe] made me promise to take care of [rip_dead.GetHerHis] [rip_heir.GetSonDaughter] [rip_heir.GetTitledFirstName]. Today was [rip_dead.GetFirstName]'s funeral. Most mourners have left by this point, but [rip_heir.GetFirstName] is yet kneeling by [rip_heir.GetHerHis] [rip_dead.GetFatherMother]'s grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29021;After [rip_dead.GetFatherMother]'s funeral I am approached by [rip_dead.GetHerHis] old friend [From.GetTitledFirstName], who wants to speak to me. Apparently [rip_dead.GetFatherMother] wanted [From.GetFirstName] to look after me. [From.GetSheHeCap] is offering me [From.GetHerHis] friendship and protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29022;Dear [From.GetLordLady] [From.GetFirstName] most graciously welcomed my offer. I am sure [From.GetSheHe] and I will become the best of friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] turned me down! How could [From.GetSheHe] totally disregard the esteem [From.GetHerHis] [rip_dead.GetFatherMother] held for me? No, I will not ask a second time. [From.GetFirstName] only has [From.GetHerselfHimself] to blame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29024;After [rip_dead.GetFatherMother]'s funeral I am approached by [rip_dead.GetHerHis] old friend [From.GetTitledFirstName], who wants to speak to me, in private. As soon as we are alone, [From.GetSheHe] takes my hand and offers to look after me and provide me with anything I need. As if to erase all doubt concerning [From.GetHerHis] intentions, [From.GetFirstName] puts [From.GetHerHis] other hand on my leg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29025;My dear [From.GetLordLady] [From.GetFirstName] burst into tears when I offered to take care of [From.GetHerHim], and proceeded to throw [From.GetHerselfHimself] into my arms! I cannot believe that such a [GetRootFromCompliment] is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29026;[From.GetTitledFirstName] turned me down, and most rudely at that! I thought that my offer to take care of [From.GetHerHim] would be met with some appreciation at least, but no. Well, I will not make the offer twice. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not know what [From.GetSheHe] is missing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29101_A;Before the incident I had no trouble with men, but now they cringe at my approach. I know that my face is a hideous thing to behold, yet every time it hurts just as badly as the first. I have heard of an artisan mask maker who crafts the most beautiful masks. Maybe [Root.GetSheHe] can help me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29101_B;Before the incident I had no trouble with women, but now they cringe at my approach. I know that my face is a hideous thing to behold, yet every time it hurts just as badly as the first. I have heard of an artisan mask maker who crafts the most beautiful masks. Maybe [Root.GetSheHe] can help me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29103;Last night my [rip_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [rip_spouse.GetFirstName] told me that my face is scaring the children. Apparently my [rip_scared_child.GetSonDaughter] [rip_scared_child.GetFirstName] has been especially frightened. [rip_spouse.GetFirstName] asked me to stay away from the children, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29104;While it is certainly better to wear it than not, my mask does make me feel like an outcast. However I recently had a great idea! What if I arranged an extravagant masquerade ball? Then I would not be the only one and perhaps people will forget about my disfigurement for a while!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29105;The masquerade ball is a huge success! Finally I am not an outcast, a freak. Or perhaps we are all freaks, just for one night. A thought strikes me – would it not be great if this was not only for tonight? If we could go on like this... forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29106;I demand that everyone be quiet for my announcement. The conversation dies out and everyone turns their attention towards me. First, as I thank them, they are all courtesies and pretty smiles. When I make my decree, however, they look as if I have slapped them across their soft, unscarred faces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29107;The masquerade ball I am attending took a grim turn when our host and liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], decreed that all of us had to keep our masks on. Forever! At first we thought [From.GetSheHe] was only jesting, but it turns out [From.GetSheHe] is quite serious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29109_A;The crazy old [rip_masked_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has died! Now we are finally free to take these masks off and begin our lives anew. Rejoice, friends, rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29109_B;I have finally managed to escape the grasp of that lunatic [rip_masked_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]. I never thought I would be free of this darned mask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29110;The feeling of being able to blend in with the crowd - at least as well as any [Root.GetTitle] can - is exhilarating! It is as if people have forgotten about the face behind the mask and treat me as they did before. The guests seem most impressed by my elegant dancing. Finally they see me and not my scars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29112;My liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has invited me to [From.GetHerHis] grand masquerade ball. [From.GetSheHeCap] will be most disappointed if I do not attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29113;The masquerade ball [From.GetTitledFirstName] hosted has been a true joy to attend! [From.GetSheHeCap] finally seemed to be in [From.GetHerHis] right element. We were all very impressed by [From.GetHerHis] charm and excellent dancing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29201;I am crossing the courtyard, barely taking notice of the children playing in one corner. Then suddenly I spot a rock flying through the air. Am I in its trajectory? I cannot tell, my depth perception is not what it used to be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29202;I set my remaining eye on the rock and raise my hand to catch it. Just in time! I close my fingers around the smooth rock and grin widely. The children come running up to me and little [rip_throwing_child.GetFirstName] anxiously begs me for my forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29203;I set my remaining eye on the rock and raise my arm to catch it, but it seems as if I have misjudged the distance. Before I can open my hand the rock makes impact with a blinding pain. Do you hate me, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]? My OTHER eye?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29204;As I make contact with the ground I can hear the thud of the rock landing several yards away. The people present do their best not to laugh, but a few suppressed chortles still reach my ears. I try my best to hide my embarrassment behind an angry scowl as I stumble back onto my feet, but I fear my red ears betray me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29205_A;Whenever I talk to men nowadays, I can tell that they are bothered by my missing eye. It has shaken my confidence and I often feel awkward when interacting with them. However, I have heard of a pioneer who crafts very lifelike prosthetic eyes. Perhaps that is the solution to my problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29205_B;Whenever I talk to women nowadays, I can tell that they are bothered by my missing eye. It has shaken my confidence and I often feel awkward when interacting with them. However, I have heard of a pioneer who crafts very lifelike prosthetic eyes. Perhaps that is the solution to my problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29301;Ever since I lost my dominant hand in the incident I have been the laughingstock of the sparring ring. Some part of me feels that I should just give up, that my time would be better spent elsewhere. However should not a [Root.GetTitle] such as I be able to defend [Root.GetHerselfHimself]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29302;It has taken many months of hard training, but it was worth it! Thanks to a talented teacher and my own perseverance I can now wield my weapon almost as well in my remaining hand as I could with the one I lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29303;I kept at it for many months, but the improvements were disappointingly small, especially compared to all the effort I put in. Over time I have visited the sparring ring less and less often. Today it has been over a fortnight since last I practiced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29304;I am not blind. I could tell that my teacher had started to lose faith in me, but I kept at it, refusing to give up. Today I paid the price for my pigheadedness when I messed up a parry yet again. My dueling partner was not quick enough to save me this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29305;Every morning since my injury, I have been startled by the stump where my hand used to be. The people around me have not been able to get used to it, either. Lately I have considered having a prosthetic hand crafted. Perhaps that would make me look, and feel, more like my old self?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29401;During the last few months I have developed feelings for [rip_love_interest.GetTitledFirstName]. Tonight we are both present at the same celebration. While my confidence as a dancer has all but evaporated since I lost my leg, asking [rip_love_interest.GetHerHim] to dance might be the only chance I get to talk to [rip_love_interest.GetHerHim] tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29402;Why did I ever worry? While I might not be as good a dancer as I once was, [rip_love_interest.GetFirstName] seems to appreciate my effort. More importantly, the conversation is flowing and all of my compliments are met with blushing smiles. This is the beginning of something beautiful, I am sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29403;While [rip_love_interest.GetFirstName] seemed to be more than happy when I asked [rip_love_interest.GetHerHim] to dance, [rip_love_interest.GetSheHe] is not smiling any longer. My nerves have made me clumsier than usual and I keep stepping on [rip_love_interest.GetHerHis] toes. It is an evil spiral – the worse I dance, the more awkward I get...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29404_A;I never considered how lucky I was to have two healthy legs! Oh, the freedom to go wherever and do whatever I pleased... I am a [Root.GetTitle], yet now I am limited by these darned crutches! It is below me to hobble around like this. Some days I feel more ridiculous than a jester...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29404_B;I never thought about how lucky I was to have two healthy legs! Oh, the freedom to go wherever and do whatever I pleased... I am a [Root.GetTitle], yet now I am limited by these darned crutches! It is below me to hobble around like this. Some days I feel more ridiculous than my jester [jester.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29500_EYE;Lately I have been experiencing a blinding pain where my missing eye used to be. It distracts me from my duties and leaves me bedridden for entire days. I have never heard of anything like it and I fear that the problem will not go away on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29500_HAND;Lately I have been experiencing a crippling pain where my missing hand used to be. It distracts me from my duties and leaves me bedridden for entire days. I have never heard of anything like it and I fear that the problem will not go away on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29500_LEG;Lately I have been experiencing a crippling pain where my missing leg used to be. It distracts me from my duties and leaves me bedridden for entire days. I have never heard of anything like it and I fear that the problem will not go away on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29500_NOSE;Lately I have been experiencing a crippling pain where my nose used to be. It distracts me from my duties and leaves me bedridden for entire days. I have never heard of anything like it and I fear that the problem will not go away on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29501;[rip_physician.GetTitledFirstName] has gotten back to me with two possible courses of treatment. The first one is a simple concoction with few dangers but a limited effect. [rip_physician.GetFirstName] recommends surgery instead. [rip_physician.GetSheHeCap] says it has a higher chance of success, but I would risk permanent damage to my already impaired nervous system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29502;I might have been right to be worried, but everything turned out for the best in the end. [rip_physician.GetTitledFirstName]'s treatment has been working wonders and I have been free of my crippling pain – and any other kind of strange sensations – for weeks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29503;The concoction which [rip_physician.GetTitledFirstName] provided me with did nothing against my pain. Instead it added another affliction to my life. My guts feel like a pit of snakes and I dare not venture far from the privy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29504;While the procedure was harrowing to say the least, I was hopeful that things would get better. They did not. The strange pain is still afflicting me, and worse so than ever. Nowadays I spend most of my time in bed and I can rarely focus for long enough to get anything done. My life is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29505_A;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has recently endured a serious injury and we are unsure whether [From.GetSheHe] will survive it. When [From.GetSheHe] is not sleeping, [From.GetSheHe] is tossing and turning in [From.GetHerHis] bed, moaning in agony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29505_B;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], is suffering from a serious disease. It has left [From.GetHerHim] bedridden and the physicians fear for [From.GetHerHis] life. When [From.GetSheHe] is not sleeping, [From.GetSheHe] is tossing and turning in [From.GetHerHis] bed, moaning in agony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29506;[From.GetTitledFirstName], my [GetFromRelation], has come to visit my bedside. [From.GetHerHisCap] eyes are full of concern as [From.GetSheHe] offers to take care of me and nurse me back to health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29507;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has been a most attentive caretaker. Each time I have waken, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been there at my bedside. My every need has been seen to and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has administered my treatment expertly. I do feel as if my health has been improving in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] gentle hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29508;During the time I have been looking after [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] health and mood seem to have been steadily improving. More than once [From.GetSheHe] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] sincere gratitude towards me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29509;I never thought that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was a bad person, but these last few days have shown me a great deal regarding [FromFrom.GetHerHis] character. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has been rough, clumsy and inattentive. I am also haunted by a creeping suspicion that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has botched my treatment, because I feel worse than ever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29510;During the time I have been looking after [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] health and mood have been declining. More than once [From.GetSheHe] has cursed me for my 'feeble mind' and 'rough hands'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_A;I never could have foreseen the feelings that came over me when I looked at [From.GetFirstName] for the first time. My [From.GetSonDaughter], my firstborn! This world might be a harsh place, but I will look after you. While you will never rule my realm you will always have a special place in my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_B;I never could have foreseen the feelings that came over me when I looked at [From.GetFirstName] for the first time. The overwhelming joy of holding my firstborn in my arms, intermingled with a bitter disappointment. You will always have a special place in my heart, [From.GetFirstName], but I desperately need a son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_C;I never could have foreseen the feelings that came over me when I looked at [From.GetFirstName] for the first time. My [From.GetSonDaughter], my firstborn! The joy and the relief is overwhelming. I have an heir. The future is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_D;I never could have foreseen the feelings that came over me when I looked at [From.GetFirstName] for the first time. My [From.GetSonDaughter], my firstborn! I do not know what the future has in store for you. Perhaps you will rule all of this one day, perhaps not. No matter what happens, however, you will always hold a special place in my heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_E;I am almost ashamed to admit it, but when I first lay eyes on my firstborn [From.GetSonDaughter], I was shocked by what I saw. Never have I witnessed such a hideous child! I have gotten used to [From.GetHerHis] malformed little face, however, and I am sure looks are not everything in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_F;I am worried about little [From.GetFirstName]. At first everything seemed to be well and we thanked [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] for our good fortune. Alas, it was not to last. Now [From.GetSheHe] appears to be very feeble and the physician is unsure if [From.GetSheHe] will stay with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29601_G;When little [From.GetFirstName] parted [From.GetHerHis] lips in [From.GetHerHis] first scream, I was positively surprised. That child has a set of impressive lungs! In all, [From.GetSheHe] appears to be very robust and healthy for an infant. I am sure [From.GetFirstName] will grow up to be a strong [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29602;The joy, but above all, the relief! Finally, a son, an heir! Welcome to the world, little [From.GetFirstName]. You will become a fine ruler one day, my boy, of that I am sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_29700;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has been released from prison by the perfidious [FromFrom.GetBestName] in return for [From.GetPossPronoun] services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_30051;To the [GetFromRootCompliment], [Root.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nGavelkind is a divisive law that will cause problems for my descendants, but I am an honorable [From.GetManWoman] and acknowledge the favor I owe you. The debt has now been repaid.\n\nYour loyal vassal, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30200_A;Eternal life brings nothing but heartbreak and sorrow. While everything and everyone around you ages and withers away, you remain unchanged. Each dreary day blurs into the next. You have decided to end your life… if you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30200_B;You tried. You really, really did, but the endless, dreary days and even longer, empty nights have gotten the better of you. With no one to call your love, no friends to brighten your days and no children bringing dreams of a better tomorrow… life is not really worth living anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30200_C;You tried. You really, really did, but dark thoughts creep uninvited into your mind none the less. You know that you are not alone, although it sure feels that way. Being surrounded by people who do not see, cannot understand… some days that is worse than total isolation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30202;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetBestName],\nYou have tainted this world with your presence for too long. I challenge you to a duel. In a month's time, bring your sword and meet me in [From.Location.GetName], or forfeit your honor. Only one of us will return alive.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30203;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetBestName],\nI will gladly rid this world of your foul presence. Get your affairs in order, for I will show you no mercy.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30204;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetBestName],\nI neither have the time nor desire to indulge you in your petty pastimes. Have you no better to do, such as running your realm, for one? \n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30205_INCAPABLE;Everything seemed to go according to plan. [suicide_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] did not mind your feeble attempts at defense and soon you were on your knees, ready to feel the kiss of [suicide_duel_target.GetHerHis] blade on your neck. Instead, it was the pommel which [suicide_duel_target.GetSheHe] smashed into the back of your head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30205_LOST;[suicide_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] was easy enough to fool. [suicide_duel_target.GetSheHeCap] was so thirsty for your blood that [suicide_duel_target.GetSheHe] did not notice the feebleness of your attempts to defend yourself. It was only a moment before [suicide_duel_target.GetHerHis] blade found the hollow of your throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30205_WON;That useless [suicide_duel_target.GetManWoman] is good for absolutely nothing! Despite your attempts to give [suicide_duel_target.GetHerHim] every possible opening [suicide_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] only managed to give you a few scratches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30206_LOST;Perhaps your thirst for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s blood got the better of you. As soon as your blades met for the first time, it felt as if you stood no chance. Yet [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] must have been on your side, for instead of slaying you, [From.GetFirstName] cast away [From.GetHerHis] sword in anger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30206_WON;As soon as you drew your blades, you knew something was wrong. [From.GetTitledFirstName] barely attempted to parry your blows. Perhaps it was dishonorable of you to take advantage of the situation, although no one will know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30207_FAIL;It had barely been a few moments before you started to cough blood after ingesting the poisonous brew you had concocted. Finally, you would be released… At least so you thought. Soon the coughing stopped, and all you were left with was a faint nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30207_SUCCESS;It had barely been a few moments before you started to cough blood after ingesting the poisonous brew you had concocted. Finally, you would be released from this dreary world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30208_FAIL;Once, a man told you that hanging was the preferable method of ending one's life. Perhaps he should have told you about the importance of a long drop… Instead you were left hanging, the rope slowly cutting into you neck, until [found_hanger.GetTitledFirstName] happened to stumble upon you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30208_SUCCESS;Once, you had been told that hanging was the preferable method of ending one's life. You told yourself this as you put the noose around your neck. The feeling of dread was short-lived as the quick fall blessed you with nothingness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30209_FAIL;You had one last look at the surrounding landscape before you climbed the railing and stepped into nothingness. Impact was swifter than you had anticipated. Instead of oblivion you were overcome with excruciating pain. As from thousands of leagues away, you could hear screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30209_SUCCESS;You indulged in one last look at the surrounding landscape before you climbed the railing. It was a beautiful sight, yet you would not miss it. A deep breath, and then you fell, free as a bird…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30210_A;Your body has become a prison. This is no way to live. During one of your rare moments of clear thought, you notice [suicide_assistant.GetTitledFirstName] sitting by your bedside. [suicide_assistant.GetSheHeCap] must help you… must end it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30210_B;Your body has become a prison. This is no way to live. During one of your rare moments of clear thought, you notice someone sitting at your bedside. They must help you… must end it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30211;You are sitting by your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s sickbed, half asleep, when [From.GetHerHis] faint voice pierces through your foggy mind. You lean in, urging [From.GetHerHim] to repeat [From.GetHerselfHimself]. [From.GetHerHisCap] words leave you cold. "End it… please.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30212_FAIL;The sound of something as it clatters to the floor pierces through the fog of your mind. You hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s voice, from far away… It is tinged with fear, denial. Hurried footsteps. You are alone once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30212_SUCCESS_A;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s hand clutches yours, and through the fog of your mind you hear [From.GetHerHis] voice. "Do not worry, [Root.GetFirstName]. It will be over soon…" A heavy weight presses down on your throat. Weakly, you struggle… Then you are no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30212_SUCCESS_B;A hand clutches yours, and through the fog of your mind you hear a voice. "Do not worry, [Root.GetFirstName]. It will be over soon…" A heavy weight presses down on your throat. Weakly, you struggle… Then you are no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30222;Some days being [Root.GetTitle] is no easy thing. There is always business to attend to, subjects seeking audiences and vassals complaining about imagined injustices. Finally you are having a moment to yourself, strolling the gardens. In the distance you spot a stranger dressed in a simple garb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30223_A;It turns out that the stranger, [death.GetFirstName], is a nun on [death.GetHerHis] way back to the cloister after several months on the road. As the evening light grows dimmer, you converse about life and death, faith and doubt. When you excuse yourself to return home, the nun asks if you can offer room and board for a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30223_B;It turns out that the stranger, [death.GetFirstName], is a monk on his way back to the cloister after several months on the road. As the evening light grows dimmer, you converse about life and death, faith and doubt. When you excuse yourself to return home, the monk asks if you can offer room and board for a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30223_C;It turns out that the stranger, [death.GetFirstName], is a [catholic.GetName] nun on her way back to the cloister after several months on the road. As the evening light grows dimmer, you converse about life and death, her God and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When you excuse yourself to return home, the nun asks if you can offer room and board for a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30223_D;It turns out that the stranger, [death.GetFirstName], is a [catholic.GetName] monk on his way back to the cloister after several months on the road. As the evening light grows dimmer, you converse about life and death, his God and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When you excuse yourself to return home, the monk asks if you can offer room and board for a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30224_A;More often than not, you retreat to your chambers in the evening feeling exhausted and weary. Tonight is no exception. Falling asleep is usually easy after a long and taxing day, however recently, sleep seems to elude you. You are sitting in your study, idly moving chess pieces on the board before you, sipping a glass of wine hoping that it shall give you the rest you seek.\n\nSuddenly, someone knocks. Who could it be at this hour? Before you can shout at the intruder to leave you alone, the door opens and [death.GetFirstName] strides in. "Good evening, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I realized that I never introduced myself properly. I am Death, and I am here to collect you." A dagger is glinting in [death.GetHerHis] hand…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You are sitting in your study, idly moving chess pieces on the board before you, sipping a glass of wine hoping that it shall give you the rest you seek.\n\nSuddenly, you hear a sound behind you, and you turn around in your chair. There stands the [death.GetManWoman] you walked with a few days ago. "Good evening, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I realized that I never introduced myself properly. I am Death, and I am here to collect you." A dagger is glinting in [death.GetHerHis] hand…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A dagger is glinting in [death.GetHerHis] hand…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30225;Afterwards, you barely know what happened. It was over in a few moments of blind rage and fear. The dagger clatters to the floor as you release it. Your legs buckle under you, and you fall hard in a puddle of sticky, warm blood. Yours or [death.GetHerHis]? It is unclear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30226;[death.GetFirstName] raises an eyebrow, an amused look on [death.GetHerHis] face. "Why not? I have all the time in the world. Though you are simply postponing the inevitable, [Root.GetFirstName], for you are sure to lose." [death.GetSheHeCap] settles in the chair opposite your own and places the dagger on the table. "Black or white?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30226_BLACK;"Black, my lucky color… Well, it matters not", [death.GetFirstName] says with a nonchalant shrug.\n\nWhat is your strategy for the first part of the game?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30226_WHITE;"White… Yes, you will need all the help you can get", [death.GetFirstName] says with a grin.\n\nWhat is your strategy for the first part of the game?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30228_BAD;It has only been a few minutes when you realize just how badly it is going. At first you thought you were safe, having kept almost all of your pieces, but now you can see how [death.GetFirstName] has positioned [death.GetHerHis] own. Is it too late to turn this game around?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30228_GOOD;While [death.GetFirstName] is certainly an accomplished player, you manage to capture a few more pieces than [death.GetHerHim] during the first part of the game. You do not like the look on [death.GetHerHis] face, however…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30228_GREAT;In the first few minutes of the game, you manage to advance across the board, taking out several of [death.GetFirstName]'s pieces while barely suffering any losses yourself. As you capture [death.GetHerHis] second knight, [death.GetSheHe] clicks [death.GetHerHis] tongue testily. "Do not get too confident. It is not over yet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30228_NEUTRAL;It is impossible to tell who has the upper hand after the first part of the game. While you have captured a few more pieces than [death.GetFirstName], [death.GetHerHis] position on the board surely looks more promising. [death.GetHerHisCap] ominous smile makes you anxious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30229_BAD;The game is not going well. There is a heavy, cold feeling at the pit of your stomach. You wish you could vomit, but somehow you think that would only please [death.GetFirstName] further... \n\nWhat is your next move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30229_GOOD;You try to keep your nerves in check, although it is nearly impossible. You are in the lead! The scowl on [death.GetFirstName] has renewed your hopes. Or is it just a trick…?\n\nWhat is your next move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30229_NEUTRAL;The game continues in silence as both of you are fully focused on your next move. At the moment, the game seems even. At least you think it does… \n\nWhat is your next move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30230_BAD_TRICK;The wine spills all over [death.GetFirstName]'s garb. As [death.GetSheHe] rubs a cloth on the huge, red stain, cursing you under [death.GetHerHis] breath, you attempt to restore one of your rooks. For a moment, you think your move went undetected, but then [death.GetFirstName] scans the board and sighs "Oh, how I despise cheaters…";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30230_BRAG;You almost cannot believe it, but surely it is so – the plan is successful! As you keep playing, you tell [death.GetFirstName] stories about your masterful chess skills, and prove them too by some clever moves. [death.GetSheHeCap] seems to have lost some of [death.GetHerHis] focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30230_DRINKING;You almost cannot believe it, but surely it is so – the plan is successful! While your mind is still sharp enough, [death.GetFirstName] seems to have lost some of [death.GetHerHis] focus. You fill up [death.GetHerHis] cup again and [death.GetSheHe] nods absentmindedly in response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

That was worth getting called a [GetFromRootInsult], for sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30230_INTIMIDATION;You almost cannot believe it, but surely it is so – the plan is successful! As you keep playing, you tell [death.GetFirstName] stories about your victims in intricate detail, accentuating the most shocking parts by slamming your pieces against the board. [death.GetSheHeCap] seems to have lost some of [death.GetHerHis] focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30230_SEDUCTION;You almost cannot believe it, but surely it is so – the plan is successful! You were right, not even [death.GetFirstName] is immune to your charms and seems to have lost some of [death.GetHerHis] focus. As you lean forwards over the table, pretending to contemplate your next move, you can hear [death.GetHerHis] breath hitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30231_BAD;Never have you met such a tenacious, unnerving opponent and never have so much been at stake. The game is nearing its end, and it is looking grim, indeed. [death.GetFirstName] is playing with your captured queen, smiling confidently. "I could be persuaded to return this to you, for the right price…";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30231_GOOD;Never have you met such a tenacious, unnerving opponent and never have so much been at stake.

EVTDESC_RIP_30231_NEUTRAL;Never have you met such a tenacious, unnerving opponent and never have so much been at stake. The game is nearing its end, and it is looking even, indeed. [death.GetFirstName] is playing with your captured queen, smiling confidently. "I could be persuaded to return this to you, for the right price…";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_30232_BAD;During the last few moves, it feels as if time is standing still. Your thoughts are muddled, moving slowly as if through a thick syrup. Random, disjointed thoughts flashes through your mind. Places you once visited, old friends you have not seen in years, dreams you gave up on. So many loose ends, and now it might be too late to pick them up again. \n\n"Checkmate." Your head snaps back up, your eyes locking with [death.GetFirstName]'s. For the first time this evening, you can really see it, and it chills you to your core. The figure before you is not an ordinary [death.GetManWoman], not a [death.GetManWoman] at all. This is Death, and [death.GetSheHe] just won. "It is time then, [Root.GetFirstName]", [death.GetSheHe] sighs contentedly. "The endless rest awaits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Places you once visited, old friends you have not seen in years, dreams you gave up on. Is it too late…? \n\nThen suddenly, you see it. The move. With a shaking hand, you pick up the bishop and set it down across the board with a soft thud. "Checkmate", you whisper, looking up into [death.GetFirstName]'s eyes. For the first time this evening, you can really see it, and it chills you to your core. This is no mortal [death.GetManWoman], but Death [death.GetHerselfHimself]. "It seems as if you have outwitted me, [Root.GetFirstName], so I will give you a few more years", [death.GetSheHe] sighs. "It is of little consequence, for in the end all come with me." And then, as you blink, [death.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

RIP.30300.b;I don't like the sound of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.c;It's not as if I flay people. Often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.d.evildude;Word of a monstrous man has reached you. This sadistic creature, known as Uran, is also Immortal and has dedicated his long life to inflicting cruelty upon others in the most terrible ways he can imagine. Rumors say his cruelty is only outmatched by his all-consuming jealousy, and hearing of another Immortal has driven him into a frothing rage. If these rumors are to be believed, he is certain track you down and attempt to kill you sooner rather than later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.d.goodguy;Of late you have been hearing tales of another Immortal, Arthur. This man, this paragon of goodness, seems to have devoted his life to helping others and righting wrongs. It seems like a dull life, but everyone needs a hobby you suppose. You have never considered yourself a bad sort, perhaps a little boisterous at times, but Arthur seems to have some kind of grudge against you. Phrases such as 'ending the reign of terror' and 'stopping the unending bloodshed' have been bandied about. It all seems very excessive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.d.highlander;Word has reached you that there is another Immortal, Ramirez, who is seeking you out. This Spaniard has heard of your Immortality and has vowed to put it to an end. While his motivations are unknown, his intentions appear clear and it is only a matter of time until he finds you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.d.horse;While the penmanship is atrocious you notice that, curiously, the word-choice indicates a fairly intelligent writer:\n'I do not appreciate imitators, especially in such a blatant display which could draw attention to all of our kind. I am coming for you. You cannot outrun me. I shall burn your city to the ground, it won't be the first I have destroyed. I shall lay waste to your people and trample your legacy into the dirt, as I have done before to greater men. History will view you as a lunatic who destroyed themselves through pride and folly. Await me in terror.'\nThe letter is not signed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30300.d.shieldmaiden;Bards sing of a Shieldmaiden named Torhild, or perhaps she is a Valkyrie walking the earth. Regardless, it is said she is another Immortal and that she thrives on battle. In the most popular ballad she fights her greatest duel against an immortal man named Caine, and after her victory she weeps because she will never again find such a worthy foe. If these tales are true, she may well seek you out and challenge you to a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

RIP.30302.b;That was lucky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30302.c;I wonder who that was?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30302.d.berserker;As the red mist begins to overcome you, you are conscious of grabbing a battleaxe from the wall and swinging it at [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] with a bestial scream of pure fury...\nWhen you come back to yourself you are coated head-to-toe in blood, [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]'s body is in numerous small pieces, and the hallway is in thorough need of a cleaning. You brush some entrails from your shoulder and continue about your business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30302.d.craven;As [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] rushes towards you, you let out a high-pitched scream and throw yourself to the floor. This seems to take [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] by surprize as [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] trips over your sprawled form. You leap to your feet and are about to flee the scene when you realize [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] is not getting up again, [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] somehow landed on [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] own sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30302.d;Without hesitation you tear your sword from its sheath and leap to the attack. [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] seems startled by the ferocity of your onslaught and is barely able to parry your first few blows. You feign a small overextension of your thrust and [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] takes the bait: As [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] attempts a counter-attack your blade snaps down and takes [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] hand clean off at the wrist. Before [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] can do more than gasp at the sudden pain your sword whips up and around, slicing [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] head from [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] shoulders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30303.a;Another victory, another scar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30303.b;Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I'm dying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30303.c;Huh, picked up a scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30303.clothes.tooltip;Perhaps a change of clothes is needed though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30303.d;Overcoming your brief surprize, you snatch a dagger from your belt and launch yourself at [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]! [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] appears to be startled by the speed of your assault, but manages a hasty block and counter-attack. However, they are completely unprepared for you catching [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] blade in your free hand and plunging your dagger into [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] wide-open eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30304.a;Urgh... Still alive. Still alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30304.d;As [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] rushes towards you with [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] sword held high. You barely have time to draw your own dagger and launch a desperate thrust as [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] it swings down at you. Your knife pierces [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] heart at the same time as [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] blade cuts into your flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30305.a;???;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30305.d;You fumble for your sword as [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] charges at you, blade hissing towards your face. Somehow you manage to parry [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] first blow, and then [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] second, but you know you are out-matched. Desperately you launch a flurry of blows, but all of a sudden there is a flash of steel coming at you and your vision begins to spin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30306.a;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30306.d;With a sudden jolt your vision clears. For a moment, before darkness closes over you, you are puzzled to see [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] standing over a headless body. You briefly wonder where it came from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

RIP.30309.d;Using all of your natural charm and wit you are able to engage [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] in conversation before [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] can attack. You quickly find common ground and form a strong rapport with [immortal_rival.GetFirstName], soon you are chatting away like old friends. After what seems like minutes you realize you have been talking for hours, and [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] reflects that [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] cannot believe they came here to kill you.\n 'I was so foolish,' [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] says, 'violence is never the answer!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30310.a;Fill the pit with rocks, it's the only way to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30310.d;Thinking quickly you step backwards into your chambers and press the concealed button in the door frame. The hidden trapdoor outside opens under [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]'s feet as [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] charge carries [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] towards you, turning [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] scream of anger into a squeal of surprize. While you are not sure if the spikes at the bottom can kill an Immortal, your are sure they will ruin [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30310.b;Perhaps we can put [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] to good use...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30311.d;As [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] makes some kind of threatening speech, you reflect that it was for exactly this kind of situation that you had concealed guard posts built throughout your home. You discreetly pull the silent-alarm rope and several squads of soldiers rush from their secret posts to swarm [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]. Although [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] seems to put up a good fight, they are no match for your well-equipped guards and are soon subdued.\n 'An excellent investment!' you think to yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30311.a;Take [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] to the cells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30311.b;Take [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] outside and burn [immortal_rival.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30311.e;Time to feed my special pets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30312.d;You call out a number of theorems about the nature of mortality which sound high-minded but have some obvious flaws if given more than a cursory thought. [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] is clearly torn by their desire to kill you and begone, but [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] clearly cannot resist the urge to point out the errors in your logic. Exasperated, [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] begins an exhaustive refutation of your points, one by one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30312.a;Raise new arguments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30312.b;Refuse to acknowledge your errors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30313.d;[immortal_rival.GetFirstName] is clearly getting highly invested in your debate. Your deliberate errors in your opening arguments have convinced [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] that [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] has the upper hand. Finding broad gestures are not enough to emphasize their points they sheath their sword, pull out some chalk, and begin to scrawl notes and graphs on the wall of the corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30313.a;Spring a logical trap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30313.b;While they are distracted, smash their head with a candlestick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30314.d;[immortal_rival.GetFirstName] has taken the bait and is vigorously arguing against what [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] believes to be your latest nonsensical point.\n'So you see,' they conclude angrily, 'immortals cannot possibly exist!'\nThere is a brief pause wherein you think you start to see a look of startled realization begin to form on [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]'s face, but before it can fully take shape there is a clap of displaced air and [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] vanishes from existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30314.a;I think, therefore I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RIP.30315.d;Some of my vassals are beginning to suspect my reign has lasted too long. While they are not yet fully convinced of my Immortality, they are suspicious and will likely make trouble if they remain in power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
