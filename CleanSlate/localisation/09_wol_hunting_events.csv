EVTTITLE_WoL_5001;The White [Root.GetHuntingQuarryCap];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_5001;Lately, you have heard persistent rumors from peasants and travellers in the wilds that a strange, mythical beast has been sighted in your realm. It's a white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry], powerful and elusive. The common folk claim it comes from another world and that the hunter who claims it will be imbued with divine power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5004;Good news, my [Root.GetLordLady]! We have received credible reports of a recent sighting of the great white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry] in the county of [target_province.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5007_fearsome;On the hunt, you get separated from your party in the wilderness. As you are roaming around and trying to find your bearings, you glimpse something strange in the distance... you ride closer and see a fearsome great white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry]! As you cautiously approach, it sees you and runs away. You try to follow but are unable to catch up in the difficult terrain.\n\nAs you get back to your party, you find you can't stop thinking about this strange animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5007_majestic;On the hunt, you get separated from your party in the wilderness. As you are roaming around and trying to find your bearings, you glimpse something strange in the distance... you ride closer and see a majestic great white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry]! As you cautiously approach, it sees you and runs away. You try to follow but are unable to catch up in the difficult terrain.\n\nAs you get back to your party, you find you can't stop thinking about this strange animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5010;You have gathered your followers and your hunting dogs, you have saddled your horse and prepared your weapons. You are ready to set out to hunt the great white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5030;After many days of hard hunting and tracking, you have finally managed to trap the white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry] in a cul-de-sac between two rocks. The great animal is at your mercy - it looks at you with intelligent eyes, and you are suddenly struck by its great beauty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5035;During your hunt, you come to a deep gorge. Right on the other side is the white [Root.GetHuntingQuarry], staring at you! You are so close, yet cannot reach it. As it runs away, you realize that you must return home without a victory this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5040;Scouring the countryside for your prey, you come upon a lone rider. As you strike up conversation, it turns out he also hunts the same great animal that you are after. His lack of success thus far seems to match yours, but he invites you to talk and share experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5045;You spend weeks in the wilderness searching for any trace of your prey, but to no avail. You find plenty of bugs, snakes and riding sores, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5050;You spend weeks in the wilderness searching for any trace of your prey, but to no avail. However, you find that you rather enjoy being out in the wilds. All this daily physical activity, it makes you feel... stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5055;You spend weeks in the wilderness searching for any trace of your prey, but are forced to return emptyhanded. You are sure that no one's impressed by your failed adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5060;Fruitlessly scouring the countryside, you come upon a small cottage in the wilds. As you knock, an old crone opens. When she sees you and your hunting party, she cackles eerily and says that she has a powerful potion that will make you a stronger hunter, sure to catch any prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5061_bad;You drink the potion down. Soon, you start to feel all queasy, and then you pass out. As you awake, you have a strong headache and no desire to continue your hunting expedition. The old crone has disappeared, your guards don't seem to know how or where to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5061_good;You drink the potion down. Soon, you start to feel all warm inside. The crone whispers: 'See? You know that this will make you stronger, I can see it in your eyes! Now go, great hunter!'.\n\nYou return home, certain in your belief that next time you will find your prey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5062;You have returned to your court. The hunt for this elusive white beast seems fruitless, but there are many more things out there in the wilds. Maybe next time you will catch your prey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5065_female_lover;Fruitlessly scouring the countryside, you come upon a small cottage in the wilds. As you knock, a beautiful young woman opens. She pauses, then gives you a warm, inviting look and says: 'It's very lonely out here, I wonder if you will stay the night?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5065_male_lover;Fruitlessly scouring the countryside, you come upon a small cottage in the wilds. As you knock, a handsome young man opens. He pauses, then gives you a warm, inviting look and says: 'It's very lonely out here, I wonder if you will stay the night?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5066;The next morning, you awake with a warm body next to you. You spent a long, pleasant night in the cabin but it's time to get back to the world outside. Your companion looks you in the eyes, caresses you and asks you to stay a little longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5202;Your [puppy_giver.GetRootRelation], [puppy_giver.GetTitledFirstName], has sent you a gift. It is a small puppy, but of the finest pedigree and destined to grow into a great hunting dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5203;Your new puppy has no name yet, my [Root.GetLordLady]. What will you call it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5204_bad;Your dog is growing quickly and is no longer a little puppy. He runs fast and has a keen nose. He bites hard too, as several of the dog handlers can testify.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5204_good;Your dog is growing quickly and is no longer a little puppy. He runs fast and has a keen nose, and your dog handlers praise his good character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5210;Your faithful hunting dog is always around, and always happy to see you. It is good to have such a faithful friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5211;Everyone at court loves your dog. Especially the children find much joy in playing with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5220;Your hunting dog needs proper training if he is to perform well during hunts. Perhaps you should take a hand in this yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5221;In the past months you have been spending a lot of time outside, training your trusty hunting dog. You find that the combination of daily physical exercise and fresh air are doing wonders for your health and constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5230;Your hunting dog ran away and went roaming the castle. He was very aggressive, chasing several servants and sending them fleeing in terror. He then came upon the favorite dog of one of your courtiers and attacked it and killed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5231;Today at court, your hunting dog suddenly flew into a rage, tore loose, and attacked one of your courtiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_5290;Your faithful and trusted hunting dog has finally taken his last breath. Long has he served you since you first received him as a puppy, but now it's time to bury your old friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_WoL_5221;[Root.GetDogName], catch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_5001;I must send people out to find it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5004;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5010;An epic hunt it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5030;Its head will adorn my wall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5035;Now I know my purpose in life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5040;Please join me at my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5045;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5050;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5055;It's my own failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5060;Sell it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5061;I don't feel well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5062;I won't give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5065;Of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5066;This was nice, but I have to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5202;I will accept this gracious gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5203;Faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5204;Good dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5210;If only people were as trustworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5211;And he loves them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5220;Yes, I will train him personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5231;Heel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_5290;I will bury him quietly in the castle garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_5001;I have no time for dreams and rumors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5004;I don't have the time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5010;This time it will not escape me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5030;I cannot slay such a noble animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5035;I'm sure I'll catch it someday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5040;It's better to hunt alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5055;It's because my retainers are useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5060;No, let's go home, this is fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5065;I really shouldn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5066;Come back to court with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5202;Send it back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5203;Hunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5204;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5220;No, I have people employed for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5231;Kill! Kill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_5290;He deserves a proper funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_WoL_5040;A rival - he must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_5061;This feels good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_5065;It's a trap! Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_5202;Pay someone to quietly dispose of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
