EVTDESC_ZE_2021;I can't stand it any more! Every time we have a visitor from another realm in the court of the [From.GetTitle], [From.GetTitledFirstName] makes a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself] trying to impress our visitors with [From.GetHerHis] non-existent knowledge of foreign languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2022;My [Root.GetChancellorName] [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName] kindly suggests that it would be of benefit to the realm if I studied the languages spoken at foreign courts. [language_teacher.GetSheHeCap] also offers [language_teacher.GetHerselfHimself] to aid me in my studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2024;Without the support of [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName], your study sessions seem to be few and far between. You increasingly feel that the challenge is just too great to tackle on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2025;Your determination and hard work has paid off. Studying with [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName], you have learned several new languages to a decent level of fluency. This will surely increase your prestige at foreign courts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2026;Distractions seem to overwhelm you during your studies. The simplest pleasures, and even plain and mundane chores, seem like time better spent than drowning in books all evening. How does one manage to keep focused when everything else is so much more appealing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2027;[Root.GetChancellorName] [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has a look of parental disappointment in [language_teacher.GetHerHis] eyes. 'I believe you could have done this well if only you'd put your mind to it. Unfortunately your disinterest is all too apparent in your absence from our meetings. With your permission, I will henceforth focus on more useful work instead of waiting for you, my Liege.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2028;[From.GetTitledFirstName] took offense at your offer of helping [From.GetHerHim] with [From.GetHerHis] language studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2029;[From.GetTitledFirstName] expressed [From.GetHerHis] gratitude for my offer to tutor [From.GetHerHim] in the languages of foreign courts. [From.GetFirstName] also commended me for the extra effort I put in for the sake of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2030;While walking down the corridor a local peasant runs up to me with panic in his eyes: 'I came here to ask for aid since some of my sheep got killed by wild animals but now I just need to get out of here. I've already paid a dozen fees and been stuck in different rooms for hours in supposed 'queues' but I saw no-one else there. Please help my poor soul!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_2021;I'll have to tutor [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2022;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2024;At least I made an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2025;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2026;If I learn even a few phrases, it will be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2027;You will watch your tongue or lose it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2028;[From.GetHerHisCap] bad manners won't do [From.GetHerHim] any good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2030;Put [Root.job_chancellor.GetFirstName] in prison for [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] bureaucratic scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_2021;This shouldn't bother me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2022;If they can't speak [Root.Culture.GetName] they are not important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2026;I guess learning languages is not for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2027;Although I learned less than expected, I thank you for your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2030;I'll let [Root.job_chancellor.GetFirstName]'s scheme slip by for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2021;Hears my offer to tutor [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2022;Studies begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2026;Language studies abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
