EVTDESC105000;It is a dire decision, to ask the Chief Qadi to grant me divorce from my husband [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]. I must be certain this is what I want before I make this decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came to me to ask to be granted a divorce from her husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]. I reminded [From.GetTitledFirstName] about the iddah period, the month she would have to wait before the divorce came through, and asked if her husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] would demand compensation and the return of the mahr, the wedding gift her husband gave her when they married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105002;The Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me what if my husband [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] demanded compensation and the return of my mahr, the gift he gave me at the wedding and told me what would happen to any child of our union. [From.GetSheHeCap] also told me I must wait a month, the iddah period, before I could be divorced or, if I was pregnant, until the child was born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105003;The Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not grant me a divorce and told me that from what I told [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] saw no reason to grant me a divorce from [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105004;The iddah period has gone and if I am truly certain I want a divorce from [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] I will have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105005;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has gone to Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] and asked for a divorce! If she still wants it after the iddah period, a month, then our marriage will be no more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105006;I was on my way home, thinking of ways to tell my husband [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I had asked the Chief Qadi for a divorce, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] caught up with me and asked me why I wanted a divorce! I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] my reasons and [From.GetSheHe] pleaded that I should reconsider, told me he did not want me to divorce [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105007;I pleaded with [From.GetTitledFirstName], promised her all she would want if only she wouldn't leave me! She told me about her reasons and I told her I would change, that I would do anything, anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105010;I grow more worried for every day no Chief Qadi has been selected. It is as if [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] does not care if just judgement is brought to those who deserve it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] worries that the people of my realm lacks just judgement when I still haven't chosen a Chief Qadi to take care of all legal matters. To ease [From.GetHerHis] worry, [From.GetTitledFirstName] came to me and suggested someone who [From.GetSheHe] believe would make an excellent Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105012;I had no idea [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] would suggest me as [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s new Chief Qadi! The letter congratulating me to my new position and the order to appear before [From.GetTitledFirstName] as soon as possible was bewildering, I almost did not believe it at first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105013;I suggested that [target_suggested_qadi.GetTitledFirstName] would be [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s new Chief Qadi and waited with bated breath as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] pondered this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105014;It felt preposterous, almost insulting, to suggest myself as the new Chief Qadi for [From.GetTitledFirstName] but there were no better candidate I could have thought of than myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105020;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s choice for the Chief Qadi position is disastrous! The [old_qadi.GetManWoman]'s judgement is severely distorted and there will be no justice as long as [old_qadi.GetSheHe] holds the post!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105021;Fuming with anger at what [From.GetTitledFirstName] called 'another disastrous judgement of your Chief Qadi!', [From.GetTitledFirstName] suggested I would choose another person for the very important position as Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105023;The current Chief Qadi is such a disastrous choice, with [old_qadi.GetHerHis] arbitrary judgements and insufficient knowledge of the laws, that I had to suggest a new candidate for this position. [From.GetTitledFirstName] would make a much better Chief Qadi and so I told [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and waited with bated breath as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] pondered this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105024;I inadvertently insulted the old Chief Qadi when I suggested that I would make better judgements than [old_qadi.GetHerHim] and knew the laws much better than [old_qadi.GetHerHim], but I saw no other way to get rid of [old_qadi.GetHerHim]. After all, it was [From.GetTitledFirstName] who would judge if I was a better person for the position than the hopefully soon former Chief Qadi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105025;May [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] be hit with sixty shoes! That son of a dog coaxed [From.GetTitledFirstName] into revoking my title as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105030;The Qur'an says: 'O you who believe! Intoxicants and games of chance and sacrificing to stones set up and dividing by arrows are only an uncleanness, the Shaitan's work, shun it therefore that you may be successful.' It is said that those who indulge in wine and other intoxicants will be punished by eighty lashes so they may know the wrongness of their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105031;I stumbled drunkenly into Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] who smelled the wine I had drunk on my breath and ordered my arrest. The next day I got my punishment: eighty lashes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105032;The wine was aplenty and when I left my company I was more than unsteady on my feet. I must have drunk enough to become unconscious, for when I woke up it was in Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s room, who told me that if I donated a small sum of money to charity and promised to never drink again [From.GetSheHe] would let me go without punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105035;There have been rumors circling the court that a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is sleeping with a woman other than his wives. The man cannot be a true Muslim if he has committed zina!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105036;To accuse someone of committing zina, having sexual intercourse with another man or woman other than your spouse, is something no one should take lightly. [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me of the rumors circling the court of [From.GetHerHis] liege [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] about a vassal being more than friendly with a woman...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105037;The days with my lover have been the most joyful days of my life but [From.GetTitledFirstName] threatening to bring the whole affair to the Chief Qadi made those few days feel petty and the joy I had felt bedraggled. Committing zina is a sin but I couldn't resist her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105038;Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] lectured me on the sin of committing zina, but all I could think of was my dear love, waiting for me in our own little hideout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105039;The silence following my accusations, that a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was committing zina, was deafening. Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me several questions about the accusations, the rumors I've heard and what I thought about the matter, which was rather flattering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105040;I hadn't really expected [From.GetTitledFirstName] to react to my accusations about [From.GetHerHim] committing zina and me threatening to go to the Chief Qadi with the matter in exactly that way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105041;I confronted [From.GetTitledFirstName] with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusations about [From.GetHerHim] committing zina and the rumors [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] based this upon. [From.GetTitledFirstName] denied everything and assured me [From.GetSheHe] is a pious Muslim who would never do anything to affront Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105042;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusations of [From.GetTitledFirstName] committing zina is not something to take lightly, so when I confronted [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] confessed and confessed four times, then promised to never see [From.GetHerHis] lover ever again I stood at a loss. Should I punish [From.GetTitledFirstName] for committing zina or should I be merciful if [From.GetSheHe] stood by [From.GetHerHis] word?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105043;I had thought [From.GetTitledFirstName] would've shown some embarrassment, some remorse for committing zina, a crime declared punishable by stoning or a hundred lashes by the Qur'an and the Prophet himself! Instead, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not deny anything and told me the love [From.GetSheHe] felt for [From.GetHerHis] lover was sacred!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105044;Committing zina is a crime according to the Qur'an and the Prophet, may peace be upon him, and the punishment is stoning or a hundred lashes. Regardless of what I told Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName], I still felt afraid as [From.GetSheHe] pondered my case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105050;I wish to decorate the new mosque with abstract arabesque motifs such as quotes from the Qur'an and intricate calligraphy is something my liege's new Court Calligrapher should be more than able to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105051;A message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived, with a most respectful tone to it and a humble request for calligraphy of Quranic verses for the decoration of a newly erected mosque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105052;I received samples of what the Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] had envisioned for the decoration of the mosque, taken special care to the few Quranic verses I had felt most important to adorn the roof and walls of the mosque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105053;I had thought it to be a great honor, designing the decorations of my mosque and I had even sent [From.GetTitledFirstName] some Quranic verses to give [From.GetHerHim] some ideas of what I wanted together with a most humble letter praising [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s calligraphic skill. The short answer was humiliating in its simplicity:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105054;I sent [From.GetTitledFirstName] some short samples of my previous works and the design of the Quranic verses [From.GetSheHe] had specifically asked for. The messenger arrived with a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I tore it open to reveal what [From.GetTitledFirstName] had written in response to my designs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105055;I saw the design of the Quranic verses my Court Calligrapher [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] had created for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s new mosque and I couldn't believe anyone would be dissatisfied with it, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is a master with the qalam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105060;The hilya I have worked on for so long is a piece of art, the description of the Prophet Mohammad's appearance and character written in gold with as much care taken to every line and curve as to every dot as I could possibly do. The brilliant colors and exquisite details is a joy to behold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105061;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a hilya [From.GetSheHe] had made [From.GetHerselfHimself], a description of the Prophet Mohammad's appearance and character written in gold on pergament with hopes of it protecting me from trouble in this world and the next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105065;With the promise of creating a golden Qur'an, with ornaments of gold and cover of solid gold, something only the most skilled and experienced calligraphers would ever be able to create, I might be able to lure my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] for some money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105066;The idea of a golden Qur'an might be absurd, the cost for the gold alone incredible but I listened patiently as the Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me about [From.GetHerHis] plans and ideas, the approximately cost of the materials needed including the gold and [From.GetHerHis] time estimate. It started to sound promising, then [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105067;With a rough estimate of what the materials for the Golden Qur'an would cost and a time estimate of about six months I managed to make [From.GetTitledFirstName] more than interested in my 'dream' of making a Golden Qur'an...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105068;It has been six months since I agreed to help my Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] dream of creating a Golden Qur'an and I am starting to become suspicious. I have heard no word of progress, nor seen any sign of the Golden Qur'an or its design and I am starting to believe my Court Calligrapher might have deceived me for money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105069;The Golden Qur'an I promised [From.GetTitledFirstName] I would create for the money [From.GetSheHe] gave me to pay for the materials is of course a figment of imagination, a scheme to lure my liege of some money. Somehow [From.GetTitledFirstName] have found out about my scheme and I am being punished by...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105075;The ghazal's poetic expression of both the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain is the perfect poetic form for my next song!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105076;My husband's Court Musician [From.GetTitledFirstName] has a wonderful voice and I could barely keep from blushing as I heard [From.GetHerHim] sing [From.GetHerHis] ghazal song about the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105077;The Court Musician's words and [court_musician.GetHerHis] singing brought justice to the poetic form ghazal, a poetic expression of both the pain of separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105078;As I sang my song, I started to feel true pain of separation from my love and still see the beauty of love. The ghazal was my masterpiece and as I let the last few notes die away I felt tears streaming down my face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105100;'Through my veins both love and blood flows\nMy beloved fills me as love empties me of myself...'\nAs I struggle with my poem I searched through the garden for an inspiration of some sort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105101;My husband's garden is an easy place to find inspiration within, and I was slowly walking through it when the Court Poet [From.GetTitledFirstName] startled me. [From.GetSheHeCap] asked my forgiveness and recited a poem [From.GetTitledFirstName] claimed to have gotten inspiration to when [From.GetSheHe] saw me walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105102;The poem did not rhyme, why did it not rhyme? Shouldn't every poem rhyme? I was assured by the Court Poet that not all poetry rhymed and I did like the two first sentences:\n\n'Through my veins both love and blood flows\nMy beloved fills me as love empties me of myself...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105103;My new poem was clearly appreciated, people were asking me to make copies of it or just hear me recite it for them. I tried to do this as inconspicuously as possible, I did not want any jealous wife or husbands try to harm me just for a sweet poems sake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105150;As the Cupbearer I shall serve drinks at the table, guard against poison in my [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s cup and sometimes test the wine by tasting it to make sure no one has poisoned it. Too bad I do not like my liege and might accidentally serve bad wine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105151;My trustworthy Cupbearer [From.GetTitledFirstName] served the wine as always and even though it did taste a bit strange I did not reflect upon it until it was too late! The wine must have been poisoned, why else would I feel this way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105152;It seems my treason reached the wrong ears! The poison in the wine, why did I trust it to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I should have done it with my own two hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105200;I took a look at some of the architecture plans for the buildings being built in [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm and what I saw chilled my blood. There were so many things that could be improved, so many small faults that could be solved if only [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would listen to me and provide the money necessary for these changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105201;'You see, this small change might mean five years more without repairs, and this is just absurd, what were they thinking? Let me have the money needed to do these changes and I promise you...'\nThe Chief Architect pointed out several flaws and faults with the building plans and asked for money to prevent them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105202;I saw before me how the buildings would stand tall and beautiful, without the flaws I had found in the building plans. Before me stood the [From.GetManWoman] who held this in [From.GetHerHis] hand and I waited for [From.GetTitledFirstName] decision, eager to get out there and make the buildings flawless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105203;Another building collapsed today! I thought my Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName] had found and corrected these flaws but it seems like [From.GetSheHe] squandered the money away. What should the punishment for this be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105204;I should have used the money for improvements! Another building collapsed today and [From.GetTitledFirstName] holds me responsible for it. I tremble at the mere thought of whatever punishment [From.GetTitledFirstName] see fit for my failure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105250;Being the Food Taster for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] can be a dangerous job. I am supposed to taste the food and drink to be served to [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] to make sure it is safe to eat, not poisonous or tastes strange. Lately, I have been secretly trying to become immune to different poisons for I am under the grip of the fear of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105251;The food tasted a bit strange, something was hidden beneath the seasoning but I trusted Food Taster [From.GetTitledFirstName] would never serve me anything that might be poisoned. Oh, how I regretted that trust later that evening, when the stomach pains erupted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC105253;My plan to become immune to poisons did not turn out so good, I missed the poisoned food intended for [From.GetTitledFirstName] and that is how I ended up in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s dungeon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA105000;I have decided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105001;If you have no regrets after a month, you may be divorced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105002;A month I must wait, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105003;I must accept this marriage then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105004;Yes! I am no longer married to [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105005;If that's what she wants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105006;No, I don't want to be married to you, I want that divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105007;But [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not change her mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105010;I should suggest one of my courtiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105011;Yes, that courtier would be perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105012;Thank you, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105013;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] accepted my candidate as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105014;I am the new Chief Qadi! Fear my justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105020;Even this courtier would be better as Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105021;You are right, your courtier would be a better choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is the new Chief Qadi! Praise Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105025;May Allah destroy [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105030;Eighty lashes for that drunkard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105031;The lashes made me cry out in pain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105032;I promised but all I could think of was a can of wine to cure my headache;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105035;The Chief Qadi would know what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105036;Confront the accused one;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105037;Try to bribe [From.GetTitledFirstName] to keep quiet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105038;You have no witnesses, only rumors and they are false!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105039;But then [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] wouldn't do something about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105041;I believe [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105042;I do not believe you but there's nothing I can do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105043;I... I don't know what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105044;The hundred lashes only wounded me, not my soul nor my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105050;With the Court Calligrapher's help, the mosque should look wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105051;I would be more than honored to create designs for the decoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105052;[From.GetSheHeCap] has outdone [From.GetHerselfHimself]! Bravo, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105053;'No' was the answer I got!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105054;[From.GetSheHeCap] loved it! Time to start working seriously on this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105055;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was most pleased with the designs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105060;I should send the hilya to the [Root.Religion.GetName] Caliph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105061;Beautiful! Many thanks to you, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105065;Ask [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to pay for the 'whole book';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105066;To pay for all the materials? Yes, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed to pay for whatever I might need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105068;Imprison Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105069;...being thrown into [From.GetHerHis] dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105075;I will dedicate this to [Root.Liege.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105076;Wonderful! Our court would be less beautiful without your voice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105077;Here, a small token of mine and [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s appreciation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was as touched by the song as I were;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105100;I find inspiration in [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and read her the poem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105101;Not exactly appropriate, but very sweet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105102;Good work my dear poet, good work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105103;Seems as [From.GetTitledFirstName] liked it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105150;Poison the wine [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will drink;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105151;Imprison that [From.GetManWoman]! Obey my voice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105152;At least the bastard is sick as a dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105200;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] must approve these changes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105201;Whatever you need, just make these buildings sturdy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105202;'No money for improvements', [From.GetTitledFirstName] said;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105203;Imprison Chief Architect [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105204;Imprisonment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105250;If [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would die because I am immune, even better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA105253;[From.GetTitledFirstName] became gravely ill by the poisoned food;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB105000;I cannot make this decision now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105001;No, I cannot justify granting you a divorce;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105002;Until this child is born, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105004;During the iddah period I have changed my mind, I don't want a divorce;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105005;NO! I won't allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105006;Fine, but then things are going to have to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] promised not to leave me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105010;I would be the best candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105011;No, he won't do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105013;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed my suggestion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not want me as Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105020;Why, even I would make a better Chief Qadi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105021;I see no reason to dismiss the current Chief Qadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105023;I was dismissed and told not to interfere in this matter again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105030;Show mercy and the drunkard may repent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105031;I will never drink again, may Allah be my witness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105032;May Allah be my witness, I promise to never drink again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105035;I should confront him myself, make him repent to Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105036;If you care so much about this, why don't you confront him yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105037;I promise I will never see her again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105038;Promise to break it up with lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105039;I am free to confront the accused, but without [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105041;I doubt [From.GetTitledFirstName] is sincere, but I can't do anything;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105042;Your words are false, the punishment will be brought upon you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105043;Your punishment will be a hundred lashes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105044;The merciful Chief Qadi [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to spare me the punishment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105050;I should not disturb the Court Calligrapher with such a petty task;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105051;My work would only be spoiled in a mosque of such petty calibre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105052;The design looks as if a three-year-old has smeared ink over the pergament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105054;[From.GetSheHeCap] thought the designs was terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105055;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not share my opinion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105060;I should honor my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and send [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] the hilya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105061;Accept this small token of my appreciation for the hilya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105065;Ask [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to pay for part of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105066;To help pay for some of the materials? As long as that is all you need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105067;My plan worked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed to pay for some of the 'materials'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105068;Banish Court Calligrapher [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105069;...banished from [From.GetHerHis] court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105075;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will be the first to hear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105076;It is not proper for a [court_musician.GetManWoman] to court a married woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB105077;How dare you court my wife with this song!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
