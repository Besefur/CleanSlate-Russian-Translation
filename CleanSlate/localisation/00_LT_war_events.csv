EVTTITLE_LT_21110;King Henry of England is Dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_LT_21110;Henry I just died without a male heir. You, together with the other nobles of the realm promised to accept his daughter Matilda as queen. But not all are happy with having a woman sitting on the English Throne. As a nephew of the late king, if you depart immediately to London you can claim the throne for yourself. Or, you can let Matilda know that she has your support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_21120;Your father, [FromFrom.GetTitledName], just died without a male heir. A few years prior, he made his nobles promise to support you and your oldest son as his only living legitimate heirs. Granted, not all are happy having a woman sitting on the English Throne, but your cousin, the powerful [From.GetTitledName], announced [From.GetHerHis] support to your claim, followed by most of the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_21121;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] just died without a male heir. The nobles of the realm, keeping an oath given to the king, have accepted his only living legitimate heir, [From.GetFirstName], as Queen. It is likely to also strengthen her husband, [matilda_spouse.GetTitledName], and upset the balance of power in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_21130;Your father, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] just died without a male heir. A few years prior, he made his nobles promise to support you and your oldest son, as his only living legitimate heirs. However, not all were happy to have a woman sit on the English Throne â€“ your cousin, the powerful [From.GetTitledName], took to England and in claiming the Kingdom for himself, usurped your rights, and was accepted by most of the nobility in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_21131;Your father in law, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] just died without a male heir. A few years prior, he made his nobles promise to support your wife [matilda.GetFirstName] and your oldest son as his only living legitimate heirs. But not all are happy having a woman on the English Throne, and [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s nephew [From.GetFirstName] has come to England, claiming the Kingdom for himself and usurping your rights in the process. Most of the English nobles seem ready to recognize his illegitimate claim, but perhaps decisive action could change things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_LT_21110;Let Matilda know that [Root.GetTitledName] is a man of his word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LT_21120;I will thus assume the mantle of my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LT_21121;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LT_21130;I will fight for the throne of my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LT_21131;I will fight for the rights of my wife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_LT_21110;Only a fool would let this opportunity pass. I want to be King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LT_21131;This is not a good time. Let's wait and see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
