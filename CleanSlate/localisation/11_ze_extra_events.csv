EVTDESC_ZE_23000;Being on your liege's council is not always easy. You have a huge amount of work that needs attention and there is so much to do. The list seems endless. Just as you are about to give up, [target_help_councillor.GetTitledFirstName] steps through the door and asks if you want any help. As tempting it may be, you would be in [target_help_councillor.GetHerHis] debt for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23001;When casually strolling around the premises, as one often does, you come across [From.GetTitledFirstName] sitting at [From.GetHerHis] desk, overburdened with work. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to help [From.GetHerHim] out and perhaps gain a favor in return, you offer a helping hand. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks at you with heavy eyes and after a moment, decides to accept your offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23002;When casually strolling around the premises, as one often does, you come across [From.GetTitledFirstName] sitting at [From.GetHerHis] desk, overburdened with work. You see this as a great opportunity to help [From.GetHerHim] out and gain a favor in return. But to your surprise, [From.GetSheHe] not only refuses your help but has the nerve to insult you for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23005;Every ruler needs to go out and meet the peasants in person from time to time. Just to make sure that they know you still exist if nothing else. As you visit the locals of [helping_vassal.Capital.GetName], you speak very frankly about what you think of them. Something that they took great offense in it seems. You look back to ensure that your guards are there to keep you out of harm's way, only to notice that they have all gone into the local tavern! Before you know it, the peasants begin to throw things at you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23006;You are calmly minding your own business, when you suddenly hear an awful ruckus outside. You open the door to see [From.GetTitledFirstName] running towards you with a mob of angry peasants at [From.GetHerHis] heels! If you would offer [From.GetHerHim] a place to hide, [From.GetSheHe] would truly be in your debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23007;As you get closer you can see [From.GetTitledFirstName] standing in a doorway waving at you! You hurry towards [From.GetHerHim] and once inside, [From.GetFirstName] quickly closes the door. Safe at last. Who would ever have thought that peasants would be so easily insulted?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23008;Running as fast as you possibly could, you see [From.GetTitledFirstName] standing in a doorway. But instead of offering you a safe place to hide, [From.GetSheHe] quickly closes the door right in front of you! Leaving you to fend for yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23101;I can send equipment of higher quality to the troops of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in order to change its troop composition and make them perform better in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23106;I have the possibility to send troops to [From.GetFirstName] and his [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to reinforce them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23152;While being in your service, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been speaking to you about his employer, [merc_band_employer.GetTitledFirstName]. So far you have only heard good things about [merc_band_employer.GetHerHim] and it has made you intrigued. Perhaps one should try to establish contact and offer a pact or a meeting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23154;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour servant [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been speaking a great deal about you and your virtues. I would be delighted to meet you face to face and as such, I invite you to a grand feast to be held in your name.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23155;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI received your letter and read it with much joy. I would love to attend your feast, and will make preparations to depart shortly.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23156;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI appreciate your letter and the effort you put into it. Unfortunately, I am afraid that I am unable to attend at this time.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23157;When [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] arrived, you welcomed [FromFrom.GetHerHim] with great splendor and expressed your happiness of having [FromFrom.GetHerHim] there. The two of you ate and spoke at great length about all sorts of things. When it was time for [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to leave, you had not only decided on a non-aggression pact, but could also depart as friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_23158;When you arrived, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was there to welcome you in the most grandeur of ways. [From.GetSheHe] showed you inside, where you ate and spoke at great length and had a great time together. Both of you decided on a non-aggression pact and could also depart as friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_23000;I suppose I could use some help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23001;I wasn't doing anything important anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23002;Ha! Well good luck with that work of yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23005;I could run to [helping_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] and hide there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23005_custom_tooltip_a;Run for safety at the nearby residence of [helping_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] and hope that [helping_vassal.GetSheHe] will help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23005_custom_tooltip_b;[Root.GetTitledName] getting away safely;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23006;Quickly! Over here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23007;Thank you! I owe you one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23008;Why that little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23101;Send equipment for heavy infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23106;Send more soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23152;I shall write a letter at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23154;Of course I shall attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23155;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23156;How disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23157;Let us do this again sometime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_23158;I was glad to have accepted your invitation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_23000;No! I can manage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23005;Maybe I can just outrun them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23006;I'm not getting involved in this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23101;Send equipment for pikemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23106;Send more cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23152;This person is of no interest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_23154;I have no interest in such an arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_23101;Send equipment for heavy cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_23101;I changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZE_22300;While passing judgement onto criminals from the safety of your throne, a young noble is brought before you. You quickly come to the conclusion that the man is indeed guilty. Condemning him might not be the wisest choice, as he is of noble birth. If you were to pardon the man he might prove himself useful to you, as he would be in your debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22400;During a particularly heated argument in the council, [target_saved_voter.GetTitledFirstName] stepped in as you were about to make a fool out of yourself. [target_saved_voter.GetSheHeCap] was able to argue for your point, not only saving your face but also winning the argument for you! It is obvious that [target_saved_voter.GetFirstName]'s smooth talking was the sole reason for your success, and denying that fact would likely paint you in a bad light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22410;During a particularly heated argument in the council, you stepped in as [From.GetBestName] was making a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself]. You managed to soothe the debaters and win the argument for [From.GetHerHim]. This turned out to be a great move on your part, as [From.GetSheHe] now feels indebted to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22420;During a particularly heated argument in the council, you stepped in as [From.GetBestName] was making a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself]. You managed to soothe the debaters and win the argument for [From.GetHerHim]. Though this only infuriated [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] wanted to win the argument by [From.GetHerHis] own means! Throwing a tantrum like this has publicly shamed [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22500;As the council meeting ends, [target_pious_voter.GetTitledFirstName] pulls you to the side. [target_pious_voter.GetSheHeCap] talks to you at length about the need to respect the authority of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] when making decisions in the council. Apparently the council is in agreement on you having neglected to do so, but fortunately [target_pious_voter.GetFirstName] offers to help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22510;The council agreed that [From.GetBestName] had been acting in a very impious way, ignoring many wisdoms of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Being a pious [Root.GetManWoman] you decided to help [From.GetHerHim] not repeat the same mistakes. [From.GetFirstName] was very grateful for this help, and told you that [From.GetSheHe] was in your debt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22520;The council agreed that [From.GetBestName] had been acting in a very impious way, ignoring many wisdoms of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Being a pious [Root.GetManWoman] you decided to help [From.GetHerHim] not repeat the same mistake. Though, [From.GetFirstName] was infuriated by what [From.GetSheHe] assumed to be you trying to trick [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22600;Word has reached you of a [target_foreign_voter.GetJobTitle] in a foreign realm who is of masterful skill and handles [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHis] tasks with ease. Seeing as your own abilities are often doubted by the rest of the Council, perhaps you should write a letter to this '[target_foreign_voter.GetBestName]' and ask for [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHis] advice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22610;To the masterful [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI am [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].\nYour skill as a [Root.GetJobTitle] on the Council of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is known far and wide. I implore you to advise me in matters of politics, so that I may serve my liege as admirably as you serve yours.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22620;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI agree to lend you advice on how to serve on the Council more effectively. Along with this letter I have enclosed a book which treatise my own experience as a [From.GetJobTitle], I hope its contents will serve you well!\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22630;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nDo you really think I would convey my secrets to you? You are a pathetic [From.GetJobTitle] and I do not see that changing soon!\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22640;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nKnow that I will never forget what you did for me! Please do not hesitate to ask if there is anything I can do for you, and know I will treat you like the dearest of friends.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22650;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I asked out of curiosity and not malice, but even so I apologize for what I did.\nSincerely,\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22660;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYou dare to refuse me help? Know that I will not soon forget this insult to my honor.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22670;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI excuse my forward request. Perhaps some gold would make you reconsider my offer?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22680;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI excuse my previous behavior! Along with this letter I have enclosed a book which treatise my own experience as a [From.GetJobTitle], I hope its contents will serve you well!\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22690;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nDid you really think that I could be bought? Take your money back and leave me be, you will never partake of my secrets!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22702;Your friend, [target_unlanded_friend.GetTitledFirstName], does not stand to inherit any land of [target_unlanded_friend.GetHerHis] own. You have always considered [target_unlanded_friend.GetHerHim] a [GetRootFromCompliment], and as such it would be a shame to see [target_unlanded_friend.GetHerHim] fade into irrelevance. If you were to offer [target_unlanded_friend.GetHerHim] the [target_friend_land.GetFullName] it would not only bring your friend closer, but you would also gain a vassal your entire family could trust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22800;It is clear to you that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s commanders are nothing more than rabble - all brawn and no finesse. You, on the other hand, are an experienced tactician and a great teacher to boot! Perhaps you should offer to train [Root.Liege.GetFirstName]'s commanders in the hopes of gaining [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22801;To my liege, the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has not escaped me that several of your commanders lack formal training in military tactics. I would like to offer my services by training [commander_one.GetFirstName], [commander_two.GetFirstName] and [commander_three.GetFirstName] in the use of advanced battlefield stratagems!\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22802;To my loyal subject, the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour offer is most generous! I graciously accept your offer and will remember this good deed in the future.\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22803;To my subject, the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour offer is obviously nothing but thinly-veiled deception. That you would even suggest that my commanders are anything but the very best is an insult!\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_22300;Release him! Now, do not forget what I did for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22400;Thank you! I do truly owe you in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22410;Now, when to call in the favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22420;Ingratitude is the world's reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22500;You would do that for me? I am in your debt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22510;Excellent, I can make use of this favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22520;No better than a heretic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22600;Yes, I will write [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22610;A touching request, I will help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22620;Truly a great [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22630;I was foolish to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22650;Perhaps I was too harsh in my response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22660;Truly a fool...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22670;Well, when you put it like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22680;I knew some gold would loosen [From.GetHerHis] tongue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22690;It was worth a try...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22702;I shall offer [target_unlanded_friend.GetHerHim] land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22800;I shall send [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] a letter offering my services!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22801;A most generous offer, for this I will owe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22802;Excellent! Now I have leverage on [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22803;This was not what I meant to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_22300;Being of noble birth means nothing. To the dungeons with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22400;Bah! I would have won that argument by myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22500;No, there is no place for [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] in politics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22600;No, why bother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22610;Fraternizing with the enemy? I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22630;Why the...! [From.GetSheHeCap] dares to insult me when I ask for help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22670;No amount of gold will help your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22702;Alas, [target_unlanded_friend.GetFirstName] was never meant to rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22800;It is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22801;No! [From.GetSheHeCap] is just trying to gain leverage on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_22630;Perhaps some money will change [From.GetHerHis] tone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_ZE_23157;Attended feast together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
