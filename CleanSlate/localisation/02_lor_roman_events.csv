EVTNAMELoR.40;The Imperial Borders Are Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.1;The whole of the ancient province of Syria Palaestina has finally been liberated from the vile clutches of barbarians and restored to the Imperium Romanum. A great triumph will be held for the brave heroes who accomplished this feat. May their names echo in eternity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.2;The dark times are over for the people of Aegyptus, as Roman rule has been restored to the province once more. The Land of the Pharaohs served well as the breadbasket of the old empire, and it will again become a vital cornerstone in the continued prosperity of the glorious Roman State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.3;The citizens of Cyrenaica can rejoice, as Roman law is once more upheld in this barren land. Yet another ancient Roman province has been returned to the bosom of the mightiest empire the civilised world has ever seen. May it never suffer the cruel touch of barbarians again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.4;The influence of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is now felt throughout the former Roman province of Africa, as it once more falls under the sway of the Empire. Imperial troops are marching through the city of Carthage, the ancient nemesis of Rome, in definite proof that history does indeed repeat itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.5;The former Roman province of Illyricum has again been restored to its rightful owners in the resurgent Imperium Romanum. With the eastern shores of the Adriatic secured, this important recruiting ground may prove vital in future campaigns to reclaim Rome's proper borders in the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.6;For the second time since the fall of the Western Empire, Italy has been liberated and restored to proper Roman rule - hopefully for good this time. The great city of Rome itself is now yours, and even hardened soldiers can be seen weeping as the Imperial standard flutters in the breeze from Trajan's Column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.7;Gaul, long thought forever lost to Roman rule, has submitted to the [Root.GetTitle] and been incorporated back into the Empire. The province has changed much since Caesar campaigned in this land over a thousand years ago, but no longer will it suffer under the rule of upstart kings or false emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.8;The Roman Empire has now expanded beyond the borders it claimed even under the great Trajan. Germania, ever the bane of Roman armies, has at long last been pacified and incorporated into the Empire. It will now be ruled by the true continuation of the Roman State - not a false empire pretending at such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.9;Cruelly left to their own devices when the Roman garrisons abandoned the province of Britannia in the 5th century, the Bretons can at last rejoice. For after suffering through centuries of darkness, Roman rule has finally been restored to their little island and they may consider themselves Imperial subjects once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.10;The power and influence of the Roman Empire now extends all the way to the old province of Hispania once more. This land has suffered greatly from the constant border skirmishes waged by its bickering Muslim and Catholic lords, but now it may finally know peace again as the Pax Romana settles over the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.11;The great general Belisarius reconquered parts of Mauretania from the barbaric Vandals in the 6th century, but it was all eventually lost to the Arabs in their relentless drive across North Africa. Now that this county has been fully restored to Roman control after centuries of misrule, it may flourish again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.12;Emperor Trajan conquered Mesopotamia from the Parthian Empire and organized it as a Roman province, but it was abandoned by his successor Hadrian just a few years later. Now the Euphrates and Tigris rivers are once again under the Roman aegis, and this time they may be there to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.13;The borders of Rome have now advanced well beyond the ancient ruins of both Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall to at last include all of Caledonia. This hard and unforgiving land is the home of a peculiar breed of people, but they will be turned into productive Roman citizens yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.14;The island of Hibernia is the latest addition to the ever-expanding domains of the Roman Empire. This land of gently rolling hills and green fields was never conquered by the old empire, but it should become a pleasant fief to govern if one does not mind the rain or the foul-smelling Norse settlers along the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.20;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! After the miraculous recovery of territory lost centuries ago, the Roman Empire has been reborn! Europe has endured dark times since the imperial frontiers were stormed by barbarians and province after province burned at their touch, but now a bright new age has dawned for all of civilization.\n\nThe Roman State will no longer be referred to as the "Empire of the Greeks" by jealous pretenders in the West, but recognized as the true heir to the legacy of Rome. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] rules a restored Imperium Romanum, but much work remains to be done. There is still territory to recover and ancient borders to reclaim. For the Senate and People of Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.21;The Byzantines, previously referred to as the "Empire of the Greeks" by many in the West, have somehow managed to reclaim enough lost territory to declare the Roman Empire restored! It can no longer be denied that they are the true successors of Rome and its glorious legacy. They claim a new era is upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.30;In honor of the Empire's recent victory, it would be appropriate to hold a triumph in the capital for the heroic soldiers who fought in the campaign. Such an arrangement will be expensive, but the people expect nothing less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.31;A mighty triumph is held at the Hippodrome to celebrate the brave generals and soldiers who brought defeat to the enemies of the Empire. The people cheer as trumpeters lead a long procession that includes parading soldiers, carts filled with the spoils of war and cages holding captives from the recent campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.32;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has commanded that a triumph be held at the Hippodrome to celebrate the brave soldiers responsible for the Empire's recent victory. The people cheer as trumpeters lead a long procession that includes parading soldiers, carts filled with the spoils of war and cages holding captives from the recent campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.40;The story of the Roman Empire's glorious recovery will be told throughout the ages. Those unfortunate enough to have lived through the black days when barbarians sacked Rome at will or the Arab invaders swept in from the desert would not have dared dream of this day. All of the old provinces have been reclaimed and the Empire now stretches farther than it has in nearly a thousand years.\n\nChurch bells across Europe are ringing to celebrate this momentous occasion and men and women in both Rome and Constantinople are weeping tears of joy. It will be a challenge to keep an empire of this scale together, but for the sake of all humanity you must succeed, lest the world plunge into yet another dark age of ignorance and barbarity bereft of Rome's guiding light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.45;You are the current ruler of the glorious Roman Empire. May your reign be a prosperous one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.46;You are no longer the ruler of the Roman Empire. It will surely crumble without your guiding hand to lead it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.1;Long live the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.20;Esto perpetua!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.21;Can it be true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.30;Yes, a glorious triumph will be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.31;The Empire is on the verge of success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.32;An impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.40;The Empire will not fall again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.45;Hail Caesar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.46;What a loss for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.21;But... what about my empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.30;A brief ovation at the Hippodrome should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLoR.30;No, we have no time for such nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPLoR.20;[e_roman_empire.GetNameCap] is restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.31;A triumph is held at the Hippodrome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x



EVTDESCLoR20_HF;People of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], lend me your ears! After the miraculous recovery of territory lost centuries ago, our mighty nation has been reborn! Our land has endured dark times since the imperial frontiers were stormed by barbarians and province after province burned at their touch, but now a bright new age has dawned for all of civilization.\n\nOur great Nation will no longer be referred to as [e_byzantium.GetName] by jealous pretenders, but recognized as the true heir to the legacy of its illustrious ancestors. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] rules a restored Imperium, but much work remains to be done. There is still territory to recover and ancient borders to reclaim. For the Senate and People of [Root.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR21_HF;The [From.Culture.GetName] [From.GetTitle], has somehow managed to reclaim enough lost territory to declare [e_roman_empire.GetName] restored! It can no longer be denied that they are the true successors of the Empire of old and its glorious legacy. They claim a new era is upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR40_GENERIC;The story of the Roman Empire's glorious recovery will be told throughout the ages. Those unfortunate enough to have lived through the black days when barbarians sacked Rome at will or the Arab invaders swept in from the desert would not have dared dream of this day. All of the old provinces have been reclaimed and the Empire now stretches farther than it has in nearly a thousand years.\n\nCountless people from all races and creeds all across Europe are celebrating this momentous occasion and men and women in both Rome and Constantinople are weeping tears of joy. It will be a challenge to keep an empire of this scale together, but for the sake of all humanity you must succeed, lest the world plunge into yet another dark age of ignorance and barbarity bereft of Rome's guiding light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR40_HELLENIC;The story of the Roman Empire's glorious recovery will be told throughout the ages. Those unfortunate enough to have lived through the black days when barbarians sacked Rome at will or the Arab invaders swept in from the desert would not have dared dream of this day. All of the old provinces have been reclaimed and the Empire now stretches farther than it has in nearly a thousand years.\n\nBy shedding the weight of the dead god of the Galileans and re-embracing the Olympians the Empire of Caesar and Augustus has risen from its ashes. It will be a challenge to keep such a vast realm together, but for the sake of all humanity you must succeed, lest the world plunge into yet another dark age of ignorance and barbarity bereft of Rome's guiding light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR45_HF;You are the current ruler of [e_roman_empire.GetName]. May your reign be a prosperous one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
