EVTDESC4000;A farmer told me how his boar had managed to break into his neighbor's hoggery and the result was seven small piglets. Now his neighbor demanded compensation he can't afford and they need me to tell them what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4005;The thief was apprehended not long after he had robbed me and as he was caught in the county of [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] he was set to trial at [Root.Host.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4006;Mercy, cried the thief when [From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted and accused him of being the robber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4007;I cannot wait until I hear what the thief's punishment is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4008;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks that I was just and gave the thief a suitable punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thought the punishment to be too harsh, I should have been more merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4010;A group of robbers calling themselves the Band O'Brothers have been brought before me. The long list of all their crimes does not put them in good light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4015;My spouse [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] is unfaithful! I'm certain about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4016;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged [From.GetHerHis] unfaithful spouse [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] before me and insists I should punish [From.Spouse.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4017;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided not to punish [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] for [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] infidelity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4018;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] is being punished for [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] infidelity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4019;I am being punished for being unfaithful to [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4020;Poachers have been seen in [Root.Location.GetName] so I should probably send my spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] and my marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] to investigate the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4021;I took two poachers in the act! Two young boys, who looked as if they never eaten a decent meal in their lives, had two dead rabbits and a live one in a snare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4022;[From.GetTitledFirstName] caught two young poachers in my forest with a couple of dead rabbits at their belts and a live one in a snare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4023;I wonder what kind of punishment the poachers will get...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4024;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my just treatment of the poachers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4025;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to protest against the poacher's punishment, but it was too late. [From.GetSheHe] thought I should have been more merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4035;Cattle has mysteriously disappeared from herds all throughout my land. Luckily, my bailiff found the rustlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4036;I managed to stop the enraged villagers before they did anything hasty to the young, beautiful woman they accused of witchery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4040;The priest accuses a couple of villagers of blasphemy after he heard them take the Lord's name in vain. The blacksmith did it when he hit his thumb with the hammer, the stablemaster when a horse kicked him and the cook when a rat fell into the stew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4041;The imam accused a couple of villagers of blasphemy after he heard them take Allah's name in vain. The blacksmith did it when he hit his thumb with the hammer, the stablemaster when a horse kicked him and the cook when a rat fell into the stew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4045;It all happened so quickly I barely registered the events. A noble had been attacked and was dragged away from us by the kidnappers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4046;The kidnappers overpowered me and made sure I could not call for help by stuffing a filthy rag into my mouth! Luckily, they did not get far away with me, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and the guards managed to free me and capture them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was subject to an attempted kidnapping today and [From.GetSheHe] is clearly shocked by the experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4050;A rumor about a spy sneaking around in my own castle was confirmed this morning when I caught him red-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4055;The peasants told the whole castle about a 'dragon' they saw in the forest and now the eager young men keep nagging me about a true dragon hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4060;The falconer is expecting me as a new hunting bird has arrived and awaits my inspection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4085;The wolves' territory has crept closer to the castle and more sheep, pigs and chickens vanish each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4110;While pondering over the guest list for the banquet, I wondered if I should invite one of my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4111;My friend [From.GetFirstName] has invited me to a grand banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4112;It wasn't until several weeks after the banquet I heard about it and wondered why I was not invited. Aren't [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4113;[From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about me not inviting [From.GetHerHim] to the banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4114;I rushed around trying to get everyone to work harder, not smarter to get everything ready for the banquette when the guests started to arrive. I waited impatiently for [From.GetTitledFirstName] but still did my best to make sure every guest felt welcome and found its designated place at my table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4115;Peddlers selling all sorts of food, clothing, exotic spices and luxuries such as glass and jewels filled the town square with their wares and shouts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4120;The coldblooded destrier and the warmblooded charger ambled towards each other, their riders preparing to crush their lances against each other. I watched the destrier crash to the ground with its rider crushed beneath him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4125;The week before the tournament was a stressful one. Stands for the spectators had to be erected, the knights who arrived needed housing and my armor had to be refitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4130;Jesters, minstrels, acrobats and dancers, all have gathered to perform at the festival. Inviting noises, tempting scents and alluring sights tries to lure people to various stands, performers and tents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4135;I saw a vassal with his stunning young wife by his side at the feast. I decided to make a toast to the lovely couple...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4145;A travelling poet who calls himself a 'bard' arrived today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4146;I introduced a bard to [From.GetTitledFirstName] today and I do hope [From.GetSheHe] liked his poetry and songs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4147;[From.GetTitledFirstName], who had introduced the bard to the court, was not pleased with me promising to break the bard's bones. I tried to explain that I would only break the bones if the bard tried to do something unpleasant, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not accept that explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4148;I found out that [From.GetTitledFirstName] had introduced the bard to the court and I told [From.GetHerHim] how much I appreciated that. Finally someone who can sing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4150;A man claiming to be a lord who disappeared seven years ago has found his way to my castle. He sings of the fair queen of Elfland and some say his songs are prophetic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4155;A troubadour and his wife the trobairitz have arrived from Occitania. Their performances range from vulgar satires to political sirventes and everything in between, including songs and poems of courtly love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4175;We had a jolly great time dressed up as wild men, dancing chained together and appearing shaggy and hairy from head to foot. Too bad the fun was interrupted when a careless person set us on fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA4000;He should pay his neighbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4005;The thief will get what he deserves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4006;He's just a petty thief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4007;Oh no, he was hanged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4009;Is this the thanks I get?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4010;Why would I care about some petty thieves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4015;What should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4016;This is a waste of my time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4017;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4019;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4020;They have more important things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4021;I should let them go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4022;Deal with them yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4023;Good. They will be hanged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4025;I did my best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4035;The cattle has been returned, no sanction needed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4036;She hasn't done anything wrong, release her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4040;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4045;I'll save you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4046;Make sure they are severely punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4047;[From.GetSheHeCap] will learn something from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4050;I am not concerned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4055;Some gold might shut them up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4060;Just tell him I am busy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4085;The wolves are not to blame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4110;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4111;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4112;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] forgot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4113;I did not want you there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4114;[From.GetSheHeCap] never showed up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4115;There are a couple of things I need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4120;Good fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4125;Of course, I won't win anything;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4130;The dancers are actually pretty good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4135;I hope you will live long and happy lives together...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4145;A good-for-nothing nobody, hmm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4146;[From.GetTitledFirstName] threatened to break the poet's bones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4147;I just wanted to protect everybody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4148;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4150;Long lost but home again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4155;Courtly love', pah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4175;The pain... but it was worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB4000;Give the neighbor four of the piglets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4006;Throw him into the deepest dungeon and let him rot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4007;His hands was cut off! How horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4010;They will pay amercement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4015;I better ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4016;A couple of days in the dungeon will do [From.Spouse.GetHerHim] good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4020;Poachers will be eliminated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4021;Let [From.GetTitledFirstName] deal with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4022;The law demands their death by hanging;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4023;They are to be hanged? That is too harsh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4035;Thievery is punished by cutting off the hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4036;She should be put to the ordeal by water;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4040;A couple of days in the dungeons should be fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4047;The offenders will be dealt with according to the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4050;Behead him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4055;Fearsome dragon, thou doth not scare me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4060;I need to go hunting right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4085;Every village will fight them together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4110;Not this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4111;I will reluctantly attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4112;Not anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4113;I'm sorry about that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4114;[From.GetSheHeCap] was the last to arrive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4115;Wasting their money on knickknacks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4120;Are they deliberately trying to kill themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4125;This is what I have been waiting for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4130;Oh no, not again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4135;I thought the groom would drop dead when you consummated the wedding\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4145;If he does anything wrong I will break every bone in his body;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4146;[From.GetTitledFirstName] asked the bard for help with [From.GetHerHis] poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4150;Why should I believe him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4155;I hope they do not dare write any satires about me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4160;They use snake oil to do that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4165;Dance only leads to... well, you know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4175;I was saved from any greater harm by a courtier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC4000;Keep one piglet each, the rest belongs to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4006;Hang him, that ought to teach him a lesson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4007;He deserved to be hanged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4010;Off with their heads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4016;Is infidelity a crime?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4022;They must be starving! Release them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4023;Hope the loss of their ears learnt them a lesson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4035;Another day, I would have spared their lives. Not today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4036;She will confess her sins after some time in the torture chamber;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4040;Only the cook should be punished, I could have been poisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4047;Put the offenders in the darkest dungeon, never to be released;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4050;Should I throw him into the dungeon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4055;Dragons do not exist! ...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4060;Is it bigger than a chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4085;Give me my sword, I'll deal with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4111;Lots o'people and lots o'food... Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4112;We need to talk, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4114;[From.GetSheHeCap] told me how glad my invitation had made [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4120;Ha! I could have done it better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4125;Let the tournament begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4130;A festival? Nobody told me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4135;Your wedding was nice, but I dare say this feast is better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4145;As long as he stays away from me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4150;Just an old drunk. Throw him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4155;The sirventes sure is interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4160;Keep an eye on them, I do not trust them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4165;I thought I wouldn't have to dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4175;Some fool poured spirits over me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD4006;Cut off his hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4007;Without hands he will never steal again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4010;Make them suffer before they die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4016;[From.Spouse.GetSheHeCap] will be locked in the stock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4022;Kill them and mount their tarred heads above the gates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4023;Cutting their ears off? That's barbaric!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4035;The coldest, darkest cell is reserved for scum like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4036;Someone so beautiful must be a witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4040;This is a disgrace! They should be hanged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4047;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserved it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4050;I will kill him with my bare hands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4055;I will kill it and hang its head over the hearth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4085;Wolf hunting tomorrow everybody!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4115;I don't like the merchants, but their wares are fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4120;Let me have at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4125;A great event!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4130;I must invite that minstrel to sing for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4145;He can stay for as long as he likes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4150;I have no reason to believe him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4155;I hope they know 'Falkenlied'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4165;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] wants to dance, but I think I will keep on drinking;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE4007;Poor thing! Thrown into that ghastly prison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4010;Such crimes will not go unpunished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4022;Cut off their ears;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4023;The only good poacher is a dead poacher;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4050;Carve out his eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4115;Fairs are fun for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4120;A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4125;The wine will flow afterwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4145;Maybe he can help me with my poetry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4150;He's finally found his way home then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4155;I remember those two, they came here last year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4160;Hope he didn't dislocate his shoulder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4165;They do look like they are having fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTF4007;He will rot in prison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4023;Killed? For some rabbits sake?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4115;I think fairs should be banned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4120;Let my doctor take a look at him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4150;I'd love to hear him sing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4155;They will be paid well, I assure you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4165;I'd love to dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP4006;I hope [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] will be just!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4007;[This.GetTitledFirstName] reacts to the thief's punishment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4008;Thank you, [This.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4009;That was too harsh, [This.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4016;I should ask [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] to help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4017;The issue is ignored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4018;The issue is taken care of;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4019;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy about the punishment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4021;Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] and Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] will search for poachers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4022;The poachers are dragged before [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4023;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is informed about the poacher's punishments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4024;That is an acceptable punishment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4025;I hope I can change [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4046;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is kidnapped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4047;I owe my thanks to [This.GetTitledFirstName] and my guards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4111;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is invited to the banquet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4112;[This.GetTitledFirstName] realizes that [This.GetSheHe] is not invited to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s banquette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4113;Best Friends Forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4146;[This.GetTitledFirstName] reacts to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s feelings towards the bard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4147;[This.GetTitledFirstName] distasteful behavior disgusts me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP4148;I will thank [This.GetTitledFirstName] for [This.GetHerHis] great behavior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
