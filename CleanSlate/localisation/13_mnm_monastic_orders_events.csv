evt_DESC_MNM_4303;My former ward [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finished [From.GetHerHis] education, in our final discussions we talked about following the [GetMOCode] and trying improve one's self in the eyes of [GetMOGod]. I have tried to encourage [From.GetHerHim] to do this for [From.GetHerselfHimself] and [From.GetSheHe] has attempted to take my advice, I wonder if [From.GetSheHe] made any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_MNM_4304;My former tutor [From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to ask me how well my attempts to follow the [From.GetMOCode] and improve myself in the eyes of [From.GetMOGod]. [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to know if I have had any success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_MNM_4305;[From.GetFirstName] came and told me all about how [From.GetSheHe] has strived to follow [GetMOCode] and become a better [From.GetManWoman]. [From.GetSheHeCap] talks vigorously of all [From.GetHerHis] prayers and time spent [GetMOPenanceMeditation] in [From.GetHerHis] strive to come closer to [GetMOGod]. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to have had great success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_MNM_4306;[From.GetFirstName] quickly changes the topic and no matter what I say [From.GetSheHe] refuses to talk about the matter... It seems [From.GetSheHe] has found "better" things to do... I am disappointed at [From.GetHerHis] lack of dedication to [GetMOGod] and [GetMOCode] and I hang my head in shame as I bid [From.GetHerHim] farewell. I failed [From.GetHerHim] as a tutor and must spend time [GetMOPenanceMeditation] to clear my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESCA_MNM_4301;One day as I am sitting with my [From.GetRootRelation] [From.GetFirstName] I decide that I should show [From.GetHerHim] an excerpt from [GetMOCode] in the hopes of teaching [From.GetHerHim] the way of [GetMOGod]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is very attentive and I am sure [From.GetSheHe] will grow up to join me in the [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESCB_MNM_4301;I have decided to take [From.GetFirstName] along with me today as I preach to the people about [GetMOGod] and how they should try to live their lives according to [GetMOCode]. [From.GetFirstName] is attentive throughout and I am sure [From.GetSheHe] has learnt some valuable lessons about [GetMOGod] and the [Root.Society.GetName] today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESCC_MNM_4301;I am bringing [From.GetFirstName] to the local [GetMOBuilding] today, there [From.GetSheHe] meets with many of my Brothers and Sisters [GetMOPenanceMeditation] who greet [From.GetHerHim] politely. As we leave the [GetMOBuilding] my [From.GetRootRelation] says "[GetMOFarewell]" to all those [From.GetSheHe] met today. I am very proud of [From.GetHerHis] attitude to the ways of [GetMOSaint].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTA_MNM_4301;[From.GetSheHeCap] is an excellent student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_MNM_4303;I shall ask [From.GetHerHim] how well it is going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_MNM_4304;I will tell [From.GetHerHim] how I have followed the ways of [From.GetMOSaint].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_MNM_4305;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_MNM_4306;I expected better of [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_MNM_4304;Ha! I found better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3262;I have received a letter from my fellow member of [This.Society.GetName], [monastic_poet.GetTitledFirstName]: "Dear [Root.GetSisterBrother] [Root.GetFirstName]. Will you, as the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] scholar you are, please offer me some advice on my poetry? Or, the attempt of it?" Reading through the attached documents, there are multiple verses, all in honor of [monastic_poet.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3264;I was beginning to think that [monastic_poet.GetTitledFirstName] took offense to my comments, but today I have received a new draft of [monastic_poet.GetHerHis] work – I am surprised to find that [monastic_poet.GetHerHis] words really speak to me. Scribbled in the margin I can just make out: "I implore you, [Root.GetSisterBrother], bear with me. It is not finished".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3266_A;"I cannot believe that you went against my wishes", [monastic_poet.GetTitledName] writes to me. "The poems were far from finished, and now I receive word that my metaphors could use work? I have been humiliated!" I put the letter away, frowning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3266_B;"I cannot believe that you went against my wishes", [monastic_poet.GetTitledName] writes to me. "The poems were far from finished, and now people are saying that perhaps I do not understand the comforting aspects of [monastic_poet.Religion.GetHighGodName]? I have been humiliated!" I put the letter away, frowning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3267;"I am flattered that you think [This.Society.GetName] could benefit from my work", [monastic_poet.GetTitledName] writes in [monastic_poet.GetHerHis] letter. "Thank you for your support, [Root.GetSisterBrother]" [monastic_poet.GetSheHe] continues, before assuring me of the finishing touches [monastic_poet.GetSheHe] intends to see to before the final version of the manuscript will enter the library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3268;"I cannot believe that my words could have such an impact on someone, honored [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]." I place the letter on the mantelpiece, the sigil of [monastic_poet.GetOnlyDynastyName] a friendly reminder of the comfort I feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3269_A;"I suppose that I should be flattered that you felt the need to stoop this low, you [GetFromRootInsult]", I read. My [monastic_poet.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_poet.GetFirstName] seems to have gotten wind of "my" poetry – it's currently the talk of the town and people seem to really appreciate how I focused on the comforting aspects of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3269_B;"I suppose that I should be flattered that you felt the need to stoop this low, you [GetFromRootInsult]", I read. My [monastic_poet.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_poet.GetFirstName] seems to have gotten wind of "my" poetry – it's currently the talk of the town and people seem to really appreciate how effortless my metaphors seem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM.4619;I have done it! I have the relic and there is not a scratch on me! I have covered my tracks as best I can. Nobody seems to suspect it was I who killed [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_witness.GetFirstName] and took the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM.4620;I have done it! I have the relic and only suffered a minor scratch in the scuffle. It will heal in time, and I even managed to hide it from my Brothers and Sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM.4621;I have the relic, but it almost literally cost me an arm and a leg... I was lucky to only have lost what I did, and even more so that everyone seemed to believe the tale I spun of bravely fighting off the 'unknown thief'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM.4622;As I dash towards [monastic_artifact_witness.GetHerHim], [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_witness.GetFirstName] does not seem to be as surprised as I took [monastic_artifact_witness.GetHerHim] for! Swiftly [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSheHe] draws a blade, and as I wrestle [monastic_artifact_witness.GetHerHim] to the ground I feel the cold metal sink in my chest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As such we would like to advise you to go on a pilgrimage, since you have not yet done so.\n\n[Root.GetMOFarewell],\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4020;Blessed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWe are pleased to hear that you have safely returned from your pilgrimage, and trust that it has been an inspiring experience for you.\nSigned [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName], have completed a pilgrimage in your name.\n\nI pray you are pleased with me.\n\n\n– From the journal of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] of [Root.Society.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4023;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nBringing the True Faith and salvation to others is among the holiest of duties. Therefore we ask of you to construct a new [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] in your lands so your subjects may have somewhere to say [Root.GetPrayers] and worship.\n\n[Root.GetMOFarewell],\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4026;Blessed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWe are pleased to hear that you have completed the construction of a new [FromFrom.GetHolding] in [FromFrom.GetName]. It should go a long way to spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] ever further!\nSigned [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4090;I have decided to show my devotion to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] and the order by taking a vow of celibacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4091;I have decided to stop my vow of celibacy and re-attend my duties to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4093;Going along the teachings of [Root.Society.GetName] I have decided to donate a portion of my wealth to those who need it better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4200;[monastic_botanist.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_botanist.GetFirstName] has contacted me, asking if I have any interest in learning more about roses. Apparently [monastic_botanist.GetHerHis] latest achievement involves a dark red variant, mixed with a particular type of yellow wild rose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4204;Escorted through the gardens of the monastery, I immediately spot the work of [monastic_botanist.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_botanist.GetFirstName]. The roses are a delicate mixture of red and yellow, a hue of sunset at their center. "They're beautiful", my escort nods, offering me a small spade. "They're a little cramped over there though, would you mind helping out?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4205;The roses that I had sent for have now been planted in my own gardens, their beauty spreading joy to anybody who passes by them. What a true marvel of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4206;It seems that [monastic_botanist.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_botanist.GetFirstName] has received the sample from my garden that I sent [monastic_botanist.GetHerHim]. Today a courier presented me with some elaborate coal sketches of the various rose species [monastic_botanist.GetFirstName] has been occupying [monastic_botanist.GetHerselfHimself] with – included are ideas of new ones, provided we continue to work together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4210;While attending prayer one early morning, I notice my [monastic_sleeper.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_sleeper.GetFirstName] drowsing off in [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] seat. Meanwhile, our fellow members of [This.Society.GetName] are deep in their contemplation and do not seem to have noticed yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4214;I gently prod at [monastic_sleeper.GetFirstName], but I get no reaction. Then I shove my elbow into [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] side, causing [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHim] to cough and open [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] eyes, a flash of anger in them. [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHisCap] face turns red as [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] blinks, the situation dawning on [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHim] suddenly. "Thank you", [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] mumbles, sheepishly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4215;As [monastic_sleeper.GetFirstName] continues [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] nap, it does not take long before [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] starts to snore. I discretely edge away from [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHim], and when [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] finally wakes up, it is to the faces of disapproval from [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] companions. How awkward for [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4216;I scurry off to fetch some ink, before I gently sit down beside the lightly sleeping [monastic_sleeper.GetFirstName] and begin my work. It takes a few minutes, but in the end I am more than satisfied – [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] new mustache is marvelous! For some reason, [monastic_sleeper.GetSisterBrother] [monastic_sleeper.GetFirstName] does not return my smile when [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] awakes from [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHis] slumber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4217;During a discussion with some fellow lay members of [This.Society.GetName], I mention the dusty old tomes I store in the library of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]. 'Most of the content is hardly intelligible!', I scoff. The eyes of my peers widen. 'One should not take writings of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] so lightly, my [Root.GetLordLady]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4218;As I retire for the night, I glance at my nightstand... It looks almost as if there is a... There's a thick leather-bound tome, placed right by my bed. What is the meaning of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4399;I have abandoned my attempt to better myself in seclusion, and have rejoined the world around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4410;For me, the biggest challenge while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] is the solitude. As I sit here and reflect upon [Root.GetMOCode], thoughts enter my mind which I desperately want to share with someone, but I have barely exchanged a single word since I began my seclusion. I glance out of my window only to see [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] engaged in a lively conversation with some friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4411;While [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] and [potential_friend.GetHerHis] friends were surprised to see me, they were excellent company! As I stood there, surrounded by people, I could not stop talking. What was supposed to be a few minutes turned into an hour before my companions had to excuse themselves and get back to their duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4412;This is the challenge I have been given, and I will not give up so quickly. I returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. During the first few pages, thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me, but after a while I found peace in my reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4413;I left the window and returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. However, my heart was not really in it, and thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me. Then my thoughts drifted to my own companions, and how they had made no attempts to get in touch for weeks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4414;I cannot make sense of this passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]! The words are archaic and their meaning is deeply hidden by copious layers of symbolism. It would greatly benefit my spiritual development if I discovered the text's essence on my own, although at this point, perhaps I would be better of asking my [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4415;A true follower of [Root.GetMOCode] does not give up easily. I kept at it, reading the passage again and again, compared it with other holy texts and mulled over the wording for hours at end. It went slowly, but every now and then I uncovered a new piece of the puzzle, and suddenly, I saw it! Such elegance, such depth! I will carry this revelation with me until the day I die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4416;In my obstinacy, I refused to ask for help. Surely I, the [Root.GetTitle], would know enough of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to understand the meaning of this passage! Hour upon hour I sat staring at the words, trying to make sense of them, but each interpretation I could think of felt lackluster and hollow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4417;Being proud is not in accordance with [Root.GetMOCode], so I decided to ask [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle] [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] for help. [court_spiritual.GetSheHeCap] was happily surprised by my request and together we proceeded to unravel the wordings of the passage. With [court_spiritual.GetFirstName]'s patient guidance, I managed to make sense of it at the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4418;I immediately sought out [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle] [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] to request [court_spiritual.GetHerHis] aid. I seemed to have caught [court_spiritual.GetHerHim] at a bad time, however, for [court_spiritual.GetSheHe] agreed with some discernible reluctance. [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] had no patience with me and when I failed to keep up, I left in anger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4420;I am bent over [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], trying to make sense of an especially cryptic passage, when a faint tap on the door breaks my concentration. I call for my visitor to enter. To my surprise, little [interrupting_child.GetFirstName]'s [interrupting_child.GetFaceDescription] face peaks through the opening. "[Root.GetFatherMotherCap], why are you hiding? I miss you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4422;[interrupting_child.GetFirstName] listened attentively as I read from [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. After I was done, [interrupting_child.GetSheHe] had many questions which we discussed thoroughly. While [interrupting_child.GetFirstName] is still too young to grasp the finer nuances, I do think [interrupting_child.GetSheHe] learned something important. Helping my [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon] is truly rewarding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4423;I read one of my favorite passages from [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to [interrupting_child.GetFirstName], although I could quickly tell [interrupting_child.GetSheHe] had no interest in the holy words. I then failed to engage my [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon] in a conversation about the passage, so I considered myself defeated and sent [interrupting_child.GetHerHim] on [interrupting_child.GetHerHis] way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4424;I patiently explained to [interrupting_child.GetFirstName] that I was preoccupied with holy duties, and that I would return to court once they were finished. [interrupting_child.GetSheHeCap] did not understand the importance of my seclusion, most likely, although my gentle words made sure [interrupting_child.GetSheHe] was not hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4425;"I am preoccupied with my holy studies, [interrupting_child.GetFirstName], and I want no distractions! Go and find your [other_parent.GetFatherMother] and leave me to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]!" For an uncomfortably long moment, [interrupting_child.GetFirstName] just stared at me. Then, with a loud sob, [interrupting_child.GetSheHe] turned around and ran, leaving the door ajar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4425_A;I have spent the entire day saying [Root.GetPrayers] in deep concentration. During the first hours I noticed nothing out of the ordinary, although at some point I lost track of time and entered a dreamlike state. There was nothing but the holy words passing through my lips, and they rang true as the sweetest music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4425_B;There is a bountiful well of wisdom in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Today, I have uncovered new meanings in several passages which I have previously never given much thought. I shall take these lessons to heart and carry them with me, no matter where life takes me. Mark my words, [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] is truly is a book of wonders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4425_C;Today has been a day of new insights and revelations. In my seclusion I have had plenty of time to think about my actions, my life and my place in this world. Things I had never thought about before suddenly became so clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4428;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\nWe are pleased with your progress. During the time you spent in contemplative seclusion you have taken a great step on the path of [Root.GetMOCode]. Hereby I declare your mission completed.\n\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4429;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\nI have heard some disturbing tales regarding your time in holy seclusion, [Root.GetSocietyRank]. I fear that you are not yet ready for the contemplation I expected of you. We will revisit this mission at a later date, but for the time being, I must consider this a failure.\n\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4430;[Root.holy_seclusion_points.GetName]: [Root.holy_seclusion_points.GetValue];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4431;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\nYou have impressed us all with your noble rule and adherence to [Root.GetMOCode]. As a reward for your recent advancement to the rank of [Root.GetSocietyRank], I have sent you one of [Root.GetMOSaint]'s finger bones. Protect this holy relic with your life.\n\nSigned, [my_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [my_grandmaster.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4434;The [ascetic.GetAscetic] [ascetic.GetBestName] has finally arrived at my court. [ascetic.GetFirstName] is a most noble and wise [ascetic.GetManWoman] and I will happily receive [ascetic.GetHerHis] council in matters of religion and scholarly pursuits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4435;There are a few monasteries close by, where the lay members of [Root.Society.GetName] frequently convene. As such, it is expected that I every so often attend these meetings, and that I spend a fair amount of time at these monasteries to get in touch with the monastic foundations of the order. Such a period is about to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4437;I have now been at the monastery for a few days, surrounded by others who share my passion for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. And yet, I still find I miss having a friend. [monastic_friend.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_friend.GetFirstName] and myself seem to be getting along quite well, though... Perhaps this could blossom into a true friendship if we did something together? I'm sure [monastic_friend.GetSheHe] would greatly enjoy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4439;[monastic_friend.GetTitledFirstName] truly enjoyed my suggestion, and we have become close friends! We regularly seek each other out during our free time, and I am starting to notice that it affects my focus on my monastic duties...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4441;Spending time in the monastery all day, alongside my friend [monastic_friend.GetTitledFirstName], I am sometimes overcome with sinful cravings of the flesh... It is surely simply the lack of [Root.GetMenWomenPreference] around here! I suspect that [monastic_friend.GetFirstName] is also plagued by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4443;Though we had a good time, it doesn't seem that [monastic_friend.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_friend.GetFirstName] was too enamored with the activity I suggested... It's doubtful the seeds of our friendship will grow any further, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4450;[monastic_leader.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetTitledFirstName]\n\nWe are delighted by your decision to join our ranks as a lay member, [Root.GetTitle]. Together we shall strive for the betterment of ourselves and our fellow [Root.GetReligiousPerson]s by following [monastic_leader.GetMOCode].\n\n[monastic_leader.GetMOFarewell],\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4601_REGULAR;Despite having been a part of the Order for a long time, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName] still does not truly exemplify the Benedictine ideals of hard work and structure. I could teach [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] to set up a horarium to structure [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHis] time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4601_SLOTHFUL;[benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName]'s slothfulness has long been known in the Order, subjecting [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] to its scorn. I could teach [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] to set up a horarium to structure [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHis] time, helping [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] to work harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4603_REGULAR;Blessings to you, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName],\nI have observed your attempts at following the Rule of Saint Benedict, and I noticed you could do with some help. Allow me to offer mine. However, the first lesson must be that nothing in life is obtained without cost, and a minor form of compensation would therefore be required.\n\nSigned, [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4603_SLOTHFUL;Blessings to you, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName],\nForgive me for writing so candidly, but your unfortunate lack of work ethic is putting our Order in a poor light. I propose to aid you to find structure and purpose in life. A minor form of compensation in return for my help would already go a long way to teaching you the value of hard work.\n\nSigned, [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4604;Blessings to you, [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName],\nI thank you for your offer of help, and I send to you the requested payment alongside this message. I look forward to your guidance!\n\nSigned, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4605;With patient dedication [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetTitledFirstName] has shown me how to create a horarium to assign my time appropriately, making it easier to structure the work I do. It has already proven to be most useful, and work comes more easily to me now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4607_REGULAR;[benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName]'s horarium was exactly what I needed to truly live up to the ideals of our Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4607_SLOTHFUL;With some help and ample amounts of discipline the horarium [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName] helped me create has allowed me to defeat my laziness. Hard work is so much more fulfilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4608_NORMAL;Blessings to you, [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName],\nI thank you for your offer of help, but I do not feel that it is necessary at this point.\n\nSigned, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4608_OUTRAGED;[benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetFirstName].\nI am most offended by your insinuation that I embarrass the Order. I neither need nor desire your aid, and I would not think to pay you for it even if I did. Perhaps you should focus on your own work rather than stick your nose in others' affairs.\n\nSigned, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4609_REGULAR;With the aid of the new horarium I helped [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] make, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName] has become a proper hard worker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4609_SLOTHFUL;The horarium I helped [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName] create has worked wonders. [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSheHeCap] has bettered [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHis] ways, and now works hard like a true Benedictine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4610;Visiting the monastery at which my order has convened this time, I join my fellow lay members in dutifully performing all tasks required of us. In the evening, after the day's hard work, the Abbot gathers all of the visiting lay members, and reveals the monastery's great treasure: a great relic that has been safeguarded here for many generations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4611;Having decided that the relic would be much better 'safeguarded' in my own hands, I must now tackle the task of how to 'liberate' it from the confines of the monastery. I can think of a few different paths to take...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4614;Deep in the night I have snuck down to the relic's chamber. Adrenaline pumps through my veins as I take hold of the priceless artifact, savoring the feeling of it in my hands... But suddenly I hear the sound of footsteps and turn around to find [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_witness.GetFirstName] looking at me with wide eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4615;I have done it! I have the relic, and shook off my pursuer. But [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_witness.GetFirstName] saw me blatantly steal the artifact, and so my life in the order is certainly forfeit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4616;Deep in the night I have snuck down to the relic's chamber. Adrenaline pumps through my veins as I take hold of the priceless artifact... But suddenly I hear the sound of footsteps and turn around to find my lover [monastic_artifact_lover.GetTitledFirstName] keep [monastic_artifact_witness.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_witness.GetFirstName] distracted, allowing me to make my escape unnoticed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4617;My plan went flawlessly! Not a single soul saw or heard me during the night, and it was not ere daybreak that the theft was discovered. Nobody suspects it was I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4618;My offer of funding a celebration of the relic was well-received, and has heightened my standing in the eyes of my Brothers and Sisters! For many days we sang, prayed and paraded the holy relic around the nearby villages. Donations to the monastery have increased greatly! All in all, it was a tremendous success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4624;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI know it was you who murdered [monastic_artifact_witness.GetTitledFirstName] and who took our prized relic. As soon as I have the necessary proof, I shall expose you to the order!\n\nSigned,\n[monastic_artifact_blackmailer.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_artifact_blackmailer.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4626;I found out that my lover, [monastic_artifact_lover.GetTitledFirstName], could not bear the shame of being incriminated in my theft of the artifact, and rather stepped out of life than face [monastic_artifact_lover.GetHerHis] Brothers and Sisters any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4950;After spending some time talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName], I have provided enough spiritual guidance to free [From.GetHerHim] of [From.GetHerHis] sinful ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4951;After spending some time talking with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], I have realized the errors of my ways and freed myself of my sinful ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4960;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to me carefully as I explained to [From.GetHerHim] how to be more virtuous, and [From.GetSheHe] seems to have come out of our discussion a better [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4961;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] clearly explained how [From.GetSheHe] deals with this sometimes unforgiving and stressful life through virtue. Listening to [FromFrom.GetHerHim], I have learned to be more at peace with myself, by being more virtuous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4990;A majority of the population in [From.GetName] has embraced the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4991;A courier is brought before me with a message, telling me that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has sent emissaries to [From.GetName] who have successfully managed to persuade the populace to embrace the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8099;[Root.GetMOGreeting] [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWe are glad to hear that you have performed a pilgrimage in the name of our faith.\nSigned [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_4400_ADD_CHARITABLE;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Since I joined [Root.Society.GetName] I have practiced charity, yet it was not until today I realized I was truly glad to let go of my personal possessions. Helping those in need is truly fulfilling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I no longer feel the need to serve my own desires – I would much rather labor to make this world a better place for everyone in it. In my work I have found a true connection to the divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_HONEST;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. On this holy path I have discovered the value of being true, to myself as well as others.

As I have followed this holy path, I have noticed that my sense of ego and need for recognition has all but vanished. This change has helped me focus on the things which really matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_KIND;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Following in the footsteps of [Root.GetMOSaint], I have realized the value of kindness. Every display of compassion brings us closer to a purer, gentler and holier world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_PATIENT;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. By studying the life of [Root.GetMOSaint], I have found the value of patience and acceptance. This realization has granted me the peace of mind I never thought I would have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Each time I have been tested, my self-control has grown, and now I resist most desires with an ease I have never experienced previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_AMBITIOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. It took time and effort, but finally studying the life of [Root.GetMOSaint] has shown me the error of my ways. I will no longer strive to obtain personal glory – I live to serve [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_CRUEL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Studying the works and life of [Root.GetMOSaint] has made me realize the error of my ways. I have promised myself to treat others with less ire and more compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_CYNICAL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. While I was skeptical at first, I have found much truth in the words of [Root.GetMOSaint]. This is truly a path worth treading. I am a doubter no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_DECEITFUL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Once, I used lies and deceit to get out of trouble and fulfill my desires. Following the path of [Root.GetMOSaint] has taught me better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_ENVIOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have striven to be more like [Root.GetMOSaint] I have also realized that I rarely envy the fortune of others anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_GLUTTONOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have followed this holy path, I have reigned in my bodily desires for food and other physical excesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_GREEDY;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have followed this holy path, I have felt my need for material goods diminish. I no longer crave excess and indulgences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_LUSTFUL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. My attempts to follow in the footsteps of [Root.GetMOSaint] has led me to realize the sinful nature of my lusts. I will try to see [Root.GetMenWomenPreference] for who they are, and not simply objects of my desire, from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_PROUD;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. In my attempts to become more like [Root.GetMOSaint], I have striven to think less of myself and more of others. The sense of pride which once shackled me is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_4402_DIALOGUE;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nThe hectic life of a ruler rarely allows for sufficient time for contemplation.

EVTDESC_4402_PENANCE;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nThe hectic life of a ruler rarely allows for sufficient time for contemplation. I ask of you to seclude yourself and think about your life and your actions – a sort of penance for your sins.\n\n[Root.GetMOFarewell],\nSigned, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank] [monastic_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4403;Today, my seclusion begins. I have selected a simple chamber in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] where I will spend most of my time during the coming months. Within those bare walls, I shall do my [Root.GetPrayers], read [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and contemplate my life and actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I know that [Root.GetMOSaint] was a paragon of temperance, however I struggle to control my appetite. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I am supposed to eat very simple food in small portions, but I am growing weary. I cannot concentrate when my stomach rumbles like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4405_GREEDY;My [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] always talks about the importance of charity, and I do give alms to the poor on a regular basis. However, I often feel reluctant when doing so, and it brings me shame. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I have had plenty of time to think about this. Perhaps I should strive to be more charitable?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4405_LUSTFUL;During my time [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] I have spent many long hours contemplating my carnal desires. Despite my attempts to stay true to [Root.GetMOCode], I can never seem to restrict myself around [Root.GetMenWomenPreference]! As I sit here in solitude, ignoring that relentless heat in the pit of my stomach is getting harder and harder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4405_SLOTHFUL;For a true follower of [Root.GetMOCode], the importance of saying [Root.GetPrayers] and studying [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] – at least my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] says so. However, while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] for days on end, I struggle to stay focused. Sometimes I feel that I am just sitting here, doing nothing. If I closed my eyes for just a moment... surely that would not be so bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_GLUTTONOUS;I waited until midnight before I made my way to the kitchens. I found some of my favorite treats in one of the pantries. After many days on the most dreary of diets, they tasted like the most delicious food I had ever eaten! My appetite is satiated for now and no one is the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_GREEDY;After coming to the realization that I am already doing so much for my subjects as their [Root.GetTitle], I have been able to put the thought about charity out of my mind. It does not distract me any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_LUSTFUL_A;I waited until midnight before I left my chambers and hurried towards the quarters of [holy_seclusion_lover.GetTitledFirstName]. [holy_seclusion_lover.GetSheHeCap] greeted me with the sweetest of smiles and in [holy_seclusion_lover.GetHerHis] arms, all of my wishes were fulfilled. When I returned to my chambers some hours later, the [Root.Location.GetHolding] was still deserted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_LUSTFUL_B;I waited until midnight before I left my chambers and hurried towards the servants' quarters. There I found a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] with the sweetest of smiles that told me all of my wishes would be fulfilled. When I returned to my chambers some hours later, the [Root.Location.GetHolding] was still deserted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_SLOTHFUL;I was so immensely bored by my [Root.GetPrayers] and [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], but after a little nap my duties did not feel quite so impossible anymore. I cannot expect myself to become like [Root.GetMOSaint] overnight. One step at a time, I say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_GLUTTONOUS;After midnight I ventured to the kitchens to find something to still my hunger. I quickly found my favorite treats and proceeded to shove handfuls into my mouth. However, my binge was interrupted as a servant entered the room. As I hid in the pantry, the shame washed over me, and I could not eat anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_GREEDY;I thought I was happy with my decision, but then the guilt came creeping. I should not crave money and possessions in this way. These feelings are not in accordance with [Root.GetMOCode], but I cannot help myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_LUSTFUL;I waited until midnight before I left my seclusion and ventured out in the [Root.Location.GetHolding] to find a willing lover. I visited the chambers of the [Root.GetMenWomenPreference] I had shared a bed with before, but all of them were either asleep or uninterested. As morning approached I returned to my lonely bed, where I spent some time with a fantasy before drifting off to sleep...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_SLOTHFUL;Waking up was an unpleasant experience, to say the least. I had sunk to the floor and also managed to get drool all over the chest of my garb. When I sluggishly pushed myself back to seated, I was aghast to realize that the room was pitch black! It was in the middle of the night and every single candle had burned out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_GLUTTONOUS;During the first days of my fast, I felt as if I was going to die. As I woke on the third day, however, I was surprised by how clear my mind was and how little the lack of sustenance bothered me. The next day when I broke my fast and returned to my simple diet, it was more than enough to satisfy me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_GREEDY;I ordered one of my most trusted servants to take a substantial sum of money from my personal treasury and bring it to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. Strangely enough, when [Root.GetSheHe] left, I felt... relief. Perhaps this is the first step towards freeing myself of the desire for material possessions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_GREEDY_book;[book_target.GetName] is still on my mind, when one of my servants cautiously inquires whether I wish to make a donation to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. My first reaction is reluctant, but out loud I say: "Yes, of course". Perhaps this is the first step towards freeing myself of the desire for material possessions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_LUSTFUL;At first, every day I went without a [Root.GetManWomanPreference]'s touch felt like torture. At night it was all I dreamed about and during the day I could hardly think about anything else. But then, somehow, it got easier. I became more comfortable in my solitude and adhering to [Root.GetMOCode] does not feel as impossible as it once did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_SLOTHFUL;During the first hours every minute felt like an eternity, but then it got easier. My weariness was as good as gone and a certain passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] grabbed my interest. I kept reading, consumed by the powerful words, and suddenly it was morning! I went to sleep with a smile upon my lips and a renewed sense of purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_SLOTHFUL_book;At first, every minute felt like an eternity, but then it got easier, as a certain passage of [book_target.GetName] grabbed my interest. I kept reading, consumed by the words of [book_target.OriginalOwner.GetTitledFirstName]! Now, I go to sleep with a smile on my lips and a renewed sense of purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_GLUTTONOUS;The first day of the fast went reasonably well, but on the second one, I woke up ravenous. I thought I would die! I hurried to the kitchen, ignoring the servants' stares. Once there I proceeded to shove anything edible I could find into my mouth, not caring who saw me. Now everyone knows about my failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_GREEDY;I ordered one of my most trusted servants to take a substantial sum of money from my personal treasury and bring it to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. However, as soon as [Root.GetSheHe] left the room I regretted my decision. When my servant returned I could not help myself, and immediately demanded that [Root.GetSheHe] would go and get the money back. Now everyone knows about my greed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_LUSTFUL;I tried to ignore the thoughts, but it was impossible! In the end, I could not take it anymore, and snuck out one evening to visit the local brothel. Afterwards, I returned to my chambers, thinking that was the end of it. However, it turns out that someone saw me, and now everyone knows!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_SLOTHFUL;I do not remember falling asleep, but suddenly I realized I was sprawled across the floor. Apparently I had crashed on top of my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], because once I struggled to my feet I noticed that its pages were torn and that I had ink smeared across my face. No matter how hard I tried, I could not wash it off. Surely my servants are gossiping about my failure, and soon everyone will know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_4405_GLUTTONOUS;After a little treat I shall return to my duties with doubled focus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4405_GREEDY;I still give, don't I? Surely that must be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4405_LUSTFUL;If I find a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] to quench my lust with, I can focus afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4405_SLOTHFUL;A little nap would do me good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_GLUTTONOUS;That was exactly what I needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], on the whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_LUSTFUL;Now I can focus again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_SLOTHFUL;That was wise of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_4407_GLUTTONOUS;Now I just feel nauseated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], am I not? Surely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_LUSTFUL;Well, that was a futile effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_SLOTHFUL;It was only supposed to be a little nap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_TOOLTIP;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! makes no progress [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_GLUTTONOUS;I am stronger than I thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_GREEDY;The money will come to good use, I am sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_LUSTFUL;Now, I know my own strength. Mind over body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_SLOTHFUL;Self-control is far greater a reward than indulgence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_TOOLTIP;Through perseverance and concentration you have managed to defeat your sinful nature and maintain seclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_GLUTTONOUS;How could I shame myself so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_GREEDY;I wish I wouldn't have acted so rashly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_LUSTFUL;I must learn to control this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_SLOTHFUL;What an embarrassment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_TOOLTIP;You have been betrayed by your sinful nature and broken seclusion for a time. This has shamed you in the eyes of others and greatly hampered your progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I shall defeat my desires with a fast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_GLUTTONOUS_book;I shall practice restraint by only *reading* about food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_GREEDY;I don't give enough. I will make another donation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_GREEDY_book;To better understand the plight of others, I must seek out new perspectives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_LUSTFUL;I swear, I will not lie with a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] for at least three years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_LUSTFUL_book;I will lose myself in reading [book_target.GetName] instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_SLOTHFUL;If I am getting tired, I must double my efforts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_SLOTHFUL_book;I will look for inspiration in the tales of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_MNM_4014;I only did my duty, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_4016;[Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] shall be my foremost companion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_4020;Praise [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_MNM_4091;The ordeal is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_4093;I hope this will improve my standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_8099;It was the journey of a lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM.4619;It had to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM.4620;Good, but... Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM.4621;I'm not sure this was a good trade...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM.4622;Noooooooooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4204;I would love to! There is something... grounding, to gardening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4204_TT;The [monastic_botanist.GetSocietyRank] smiles.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4205_TT;§Y[monastic_botanist.GetTitledName]§! will receive your thanks.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4206;I am happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4206_TT;You do [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s work.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4210;I should wake [monastic_sleeper.GetHerHim], before anyone catches on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4214;Think nothing of it, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4215;[monastic_sleeper.GetSheHeCap] did look rather comfortable there, for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4216;What is not to like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4217;Hrm... I shall see to it that the most dangerous ones are destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4217_zealous;You misunderstand! I am getting rid of the book, tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4218;I am fairly certain I got rid of this thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4218_TT;You throw the book out, ordering it burned.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4399;I am good enough as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4400_GOD;Praised be [Root.GetMOGod]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4400_NOGOD;I will double my efforts from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4403_GOD;[Root.GetMOGod] shall be my companion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4405_tt_fail;attempting to practice the vice moderately, but it is not quite enough to restore focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4405_tt_success;dealing with vice by practicing it moderately without getting noticed.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4410;I will go down there and join them, if only for a few minutes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4410_TOOLTIP;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! struggles while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4411;That was nice, although I know I shouldn't have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4412;Being alone is not so bad, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4413;How did [Root.GetMOSaint] cope with this loneliness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4414;I will figure this out on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4414_TOOLTIP_FAILURE;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! fails to make sense of the passage.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4414_TOOLTIP_SUCCESS;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! interprets the passage successfully, a testament to [Root.GetHerHis] great understanding of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4418;[court_spiritual.GetJobTitle] [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] is the ignorant one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4420;Come here, [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon], and we shall read [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4420_TOOLTIP_FAILURE;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! fails to teach §Y[interrupting_child.GetTitledFirstName]§!, thus wasting time which could have been spent contemplating [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4424;I shall return to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4425;That came out wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4426_GOD;[Root.GetMOGod] has shown me the light!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4426_NOGOD;Today my awareness has truly expended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4428;You honor me, [Root.Society.GrandMaster.GetSocietyRank];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4429;I have failed you, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4434;[Root.GetMOGreeting], [ascetic.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4435;I will fulfill my duties, as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4439;Let's focus on my duties. It is why I am here, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4441;I will manage, somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4443;That's too bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4450;It is a great honor, [monastic_leader.GetSocietyRank].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4601;I will, but [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHis] first lesson must be that good things do not come for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4601_TOOLTIP;Offer to help [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetTitledFirstName] in return for monetary compensation.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4603;[benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetSheHeCap] is right, I could use the help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4607;Hard work is its own reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4608_NORMAL;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4608_OUTRAGED;This is... Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4608_TOOLTIP;[benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetTitledFirstName] has rejected my offer of help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4609;[benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName] is now truly one of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4610;That's nice, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4611;Grab it and RUN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4611_TT;Though bold and simple, simply waiting for nobody to be looking and then running as fast as possible is not likely to result in success...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_3262;While I enjoy the metaphors, they seem a little forced?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_3264;I think [This.Society.GetName] will treasure these words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_3264_TT;You intend to make sure that the writings will go to §Y[This.Society.GetName]§! for safe-keeping.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4200;Oh, I simply must have some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4200_TT;You will send someone to collect some of these roses.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4204;Oh, I can do that. I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4204_TT;You embrace this new interest.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4210;[monastic_sleeper.GetSheHeCap] looks like [monastic_sleeper.GetSheHe] could use a nap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4214;It seems I saved you from some real embarrassment there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4217;I have actually been arranging for several tomes to be burned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4217_zealous;Actually, I shall cleanse my whole [Root.GetCapitalHolding] of these accursed objects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_4410;I should stay here, alone with my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4414;There is no shame in asking for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4414_TOOLTIP_FAILURE;§Y[court_spiritual.GetTitledName]§! is unhelpful and §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! fails to make sense of the passage.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_4601;No, [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSheHe] must find [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHis] own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_4610;Let us celebrate its glory! I'm paying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4610_TT;This will likely please everyone in the order.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4611;Bribe the Abbot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4611_TT;Bribing the Abbot to ensure nobody is around would be almost guaranteed to succeed. He is, however, just as guaranteed to have a high price...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNM_4204_TT;The [Root.GetSocietyRank] nods at you in agreement – §Y[monastic_botanist.GetTitledName]§! will receive a letter with your compliments.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
