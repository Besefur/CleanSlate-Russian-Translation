EVTDESC_HFP_80000;Cart after cart is brought before me. I try to keep track of how many there are but quickly loses count. They are numerous, and every single one is filled with nothing but gold. To see such wealth is extraordinary and to know that all of it belong to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_80010;Just as I am about to retire for the day a messenger comes running up to me, quite out of breath. He bows quickly before speaking, "Forgive me, my [Root.GetLordLady], for disturbing but... Our gold mine has collapsed! There is simply no more gold to be found in [depleted_gold_mine_target.GetName]";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_80015;I just received word that the gold mine in [depleted_gold_mine_target.GetName] is fully operational once more! The workers found another vein a few days ago and have already begun mining it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_80020;It would seem that a recent influx of gold in [gold_inflation_province.GetName] has caused local prices to increase. Not only does it make things more expensive, but it also leaves the peasants with less money with which to pay me taxes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_80000;Gold! My one true love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_80010;What?! No more gold?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_80015;This is most excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_80020;Such is the price of gold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_80020;Clever investments should keep the inflation in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_80020;Have soldiers take back the gold by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HFP_80000;Gold Rush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
