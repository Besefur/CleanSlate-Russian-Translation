EVTDESC72000;While I was busy preparing for my feast, a troop of wandering jongleurs arrived at the castle. They looked a bit ragged but their performance entertained the whole castle. Perhaps I should think about offering them my patronage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72001;The wandering minstrel entered the castle singing and did not stop until he found me. With a flourishing bow and one long, sad tone from his lute he finished his song and asked for my patronage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72002;Everybody was talking about the musicians and I finally had some time off from the preparations for my feast so I could see with my own eyes and hear with my own ears what people was talking about. The musicians were good, and they were looking for a patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72003;The best part about preparing a feast is deciding what foodstuff to serve. I must purchase venison, boar and duck, spices, wine and ale, honey for the desserts, cheeses and perhaps even a swan or a peacock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72004;Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] has grave news: part of the castle, where the guests would be staying, would have to be repaired or else [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] couldn't guarantee the guests safety. It would be rather costly but [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] assured me the repairs would be worth the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72005;Bands of robbers are roaming in [Root.Location.GetName] and their very presence threatens my soon to be arriving guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72006;The fire blasted right past my face and I felt how my hair started to curl away from the fire. The fire-eater had been a bit too careless for my taste, but his troop and he was clearly greatly skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72007;The conjurer produced a rabbit from a hat, then made a handkerchief change color from brown to red and then he simply vanished from the room, only to knock on the door and open it a few seconds later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72008;No feast is complete without boar meat. Who will get the prestigious task of hunting and slaying the boars needed for the feast?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72009;When I opened the door I saw no one but as I stepped aside to close it a group of acrobats cartwheeled, somersaulted and tumbled in. They performed all sorts of tricks and everyone watching exploded into applause when they finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72010;Most of the preparations for the feast has been made, now I only have to send out the invitations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72011;Dear [Root.GetBestName], I hereby invite you to the grand feast in [From.Location.GetName]. Your presence at the feast would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to your attendance.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72012;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I thank you for your invitation but I will not be able to attend your feast. In fact, I refuse to set my foot in the same castle as you!\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72015;The guests have finally arrived! All is ready, the cooks have worked day and night preparing the food, and the castle has never looked lovelier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72016;[From.GetTitledFirstName] greeted us warmly to [From.GetHerHis] feast, wine was served and the most delicious aromas came from the kitchen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020;Much thought and consideration had been put into the courses served at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast. The venison was so tender it almost melted on the tongue, the boar delicious, the cheeses many and palatable, but the dessert outdid all the other dishes: a large cake with cream, honey and berries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021;The courses at the feast were few but palatable. We were served venison, some sort of fowl, a few cheeses, bread and a small dessert. It was not really the abundance of food I had expected [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to serve at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022;Instead of the venison, the boar and all kinds of cheeses I had thought [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would serve at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast, we were served courses that could have been served at dinner at a much poorer [Root.Liege.GetManWoman]'s table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] spoke up and told everyone how great the food at my feast was. I was really glad someone was kind enough to say something nice about the food, given how hard I had worked to ensure that food was the best part of the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72024;Some of my guests did not seem satisfied with the food, but I would never have thought one of them would have complained out loud! [From.GetTitledFirstName] said a lot of nasty stuff about the food and I couldn't help but feel irritated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72025;I was seated besides a person I had never really talked with before. We ended up together in the garden with a couple of bottles from [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s well-stocked wine cellar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72026;I enjoyed [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s company and we talked in the garden for several hours until we both fell asleep, maybe because of all that wine we drank...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72027;The feast was great but I couldn't stand [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s irritating voice for more than a couple of hours, so I excused myself, grabbed a couple of wine bottles and headed for a quiet corner. Someone else had had the same thought as I and together we shared the wine and our dislike for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72028;When we had escaped from [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast we shared the wine [From.GetTitledFirstName] brought and talked about our mutual dislike for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72030;I saw my mortal enemy [feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] as soon as I stepped into [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s castle. [feast_duel_target.GetHerHisCap] presence was almost more than I could bear and I longed to pick up my sword and impale [feast_duel_target.GetHerHim] with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72031;When [From.GetTitledFirstName] challenged me to a duel in front of everyone at the feast I felt almost ashamed for [From.GetHerHim], to challenge someone when both are guests in another man's house is unheard of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72032;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was gracious to let us duel in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] garden and provided us with a sword each. I attacked first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72033;The duel is over and my opponent [From.GetTitledFirstName] lies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72034;'How dare you spoil my feast with your silly quarrel?!'\n\nI managed to stop the duel before anyone was killed but I could tell [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not really listen to me, [From.GetSheHe] looked as eager as ever to settle the scores with [From.GetHerHis] 'mortal enemy' [feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72035;[From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to kill [From.GetHerHis] opponent [feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] before I managed to stop the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72036;The duel was over when I reached them, [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s opponent, [feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName], lay wounded at [From.GetHerHis] feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72037;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s maimed opponent, [feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName], tried to stand up when I reached them, but collapsed once again at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72038;I hear [From.GetTitledFirstName] challenge one of my other guests to a duel and before I have any chance to interfere, the two duellers go outside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72039;Both [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] reentered my castle without any visible wounds. It seemed as if [From.GetTitledFirstName] had refused to duel [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72040;I had a lovely dinner neighbor and after some wine we were both a bit drunk and, if I read the situation correctly, more than attracted to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72041;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I ended up in a room with a big bed in the middle of the room. Despite the wine and the obvious attraction between us, it suddenly felt a bit awkward being alone together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72042;I have often thought about the feast when I and [From.GetTitledFirstName] spent a night together. Unfortunately, the night resulted in an unwanted pregnancy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72045;The wine flowed at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast and whenever I emptied my cup a servant refilled it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72046;The wine was so smooth and good to drink it took a while before I realized I had drunk too much. In fact, I only realized it when [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s Steward [Root.Liege.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I needed anything and I threw up on [Root.Liege.job_treasurer.GetHerHis] shoes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72047;[Root.GetTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] had noticed [From.GetTitledFirstName] had drunk too much wine and was trying to to dissuade [From.GetHerHim] from drinking any more when [From.GetTitledFirstName] threw up on [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s shoes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72048;I vaguely remembered [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast when I woke up next morning, I remembered the wine but I did not remember getting to the bed I was lying in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72049;The more wine [From.GetTitledFirstName] drank, the more and louder [From.GetSheHe] talked and laughed until [From.GetSheHe] let out a loud snoring and fell face first into [From.GetHerHis] plate. The servants discreetly removed [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the table and took [From.GetHerHim] to a bedchamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72050;When I traveled to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast a band of highway robbers attacked me and my retinue. We managed to fend them off and barely escaped with our lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72051;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was attacked on [From.GetHerHis] way here by the band of highway robbers that roams the county [Root.Location.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72052;Everyone drank and w happy, except [From.GetTitledFirstName] who refused more wine! This insulting gesture means that [From.GetSheHe] does not appreciate my hospitality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72055;During [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast, a servant spilled wine all over my finest garb ruining its white fabric completely. I grabbed my knife and cut his throat, then returned to my seat and kept eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72056;[From.GetTitledFirstName] cut the throat of one of my servants when the clumsy man spilled wine over [From.GetHerHis] garb!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72057;Guards seized me and made me spill even more wine onto my now completely ruined garb. Without a word and deaf to my protests, they carried me to the dungeon of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and left me there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72060;After having been insulted and been the butt of the jokes for far too long, my patience with my court jester was beginning to run out. One last joke and I don't know what I will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72061;It did not surprise me when [From.GetTitledFirstName] lost his temper when [From.GetHerHis] jester told a particularly nasty joke about [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetTitledFirstName] bellowed for [From.GetHerHis] guards to drag the jester down to the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72062;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s patience with the jokes [From.GetHerHis] jester told about [From.GetHerHim] was remarkable! A lesser [From.GetManWoman] would surely thrown the jester into [From.GetHerHis] dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72063;What would a feast be without entertainment? The jongleurs' dexterity and skill impressed and captivated my guests, making me very pleased with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72064;The jongleurs [From.GetTitledFirstName] had hired for the feast impressed and captivated all of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guests with their dexterity and skill, including me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72065;The minstrel sang and the ladies wept, the minstrel sang and the lords laughed. His performance at my feast was above my expectations and I congratulated myself for hiring him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72066;I am not ashamed to admit I both laughed and cried when the minstrel sang. The minstrel's performance at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast was extraordinary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72067;The musicians played and my guests danced. I made certain I danced with several different persons and I think we all had great fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72068;I danced and danced until my face was red and my feet hurt, then I took a short pause and then danced some more. The musicians at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast played so good it was hard to stay still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72069;People exclaimed in wonder and fear when the fire-eaters performed. After their performance was over many eyebrows and beards were singed but none of the guests seemed to care when they applauded the fire-eaters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72070;The fire-eaters exited the room unharmed, but the rest of us were slightly singed and some eyebrows could be seen missing. None of us cared though, their performance had been spectacular!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72071;The conjurer's magic tricks enchanted and charmed my guests at the feast, the women squealed with delight when he produced a rabbit from his hat and the men laughed when he made my crown disappear and then found it under the jester's hat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72072;I laughed so hard when the conjurer first made [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s crown disappear I was afraid I would snort wine through my nose! The feast was great but the conjurer really made the night special.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72075;I made sure the most beautiful lady would be my dinner partner and during the feast I kept refilling both our wine glasses. My charm and my winning smile made it impossible for her to stay unresponsive, it didn't take long until she looked at me with more than interest in her eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72076;[From.GetTitledFirstName] took me on a quick tour of [From.GetHerHis] castle and we ended up in [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72077;The night of passion [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I shared resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, and [From.GetHerHis] husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] is not happy about the news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72080;I started talking to one of my guests at the feast and found them most interesting. Hours flew by, wine bottles were emptied, other guests excused themselves and went to bed but we kept talking until the wee hours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72081;I had so much fun talking to [From.GetTitledFirstName] I forgot the other guests and the time. When we finally emerged from our latest discussion we realized the other guests had gone to sleep and it was early in the morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72085;Some of the guests were invited with a ulterior motive, I want their titles! I had trouble finding one of them alone long enough to set my plan in motion and I was about to scrap it altogether when I finally saw one of them, alone, in the garden...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72086;I was startled when [From.GetTitledName] pulled me aside for a private conversation during the feast. [From.GetTitledName] carefully explained that [From.GetSheHe] felt one of my titles rightfully belonged to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72087;After several hours of negotiation [From.GetTitledFirstName] agreed to grant me the title. We returned to the feast together and drank a toast to our agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72088;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to give me the title I sought after!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72089;The feast was great, until the guards grabbed me and threw me into [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s dungeon! The greedy [From.GetTitledFirstName] might think I would willingly give [From.GetHerHim] the title [From.GetSheHe] wants for my freedom, but I'll prove [From.GetTitledFirstName] I am stronger than [From.GetSheHe] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72090;I saw the most beautiful girl at the feast and I decided I would try to charm her. She responded to my advances and started making her own, should I take this further?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72091;I saw [From.GetTitledFirstName] together with my daughter and kept a close eye on them. It seemed harmless, just a boy and a girl flirting, but I was relieved when [From.GetTitledFirstName] left my daughter to talk with someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72092;I watched as my daughter and [From.GetTitledFirstName] started talking, flirting with each other. When they left, hand in hand, I had to stop myself from getting up and stalking after them. The looks they gave each other the next day confirmed what I had feared yesterday: [From.GetFirstName] seduced my little girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72093;My son seduced [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s daughter at my feast and now [From.GetSheHe] is very angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72094;I did not realize the young, beautiful lady I seduced at the feast were [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s daughter! [From.GetSheHeCap] spluttered with anger but I could still make out what [From.GetSheHe] called me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72095;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came humbly to me and told me how my son had seduced [From.GetHerHis] young, innocent daughter. [From.GetSheHeCap] did not demand anything of me, just seemed upset and I could not really make out how [From.GetSheHe] wanted me to deal with this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72096;The young, beautiful lady I seduced at the feast was none other than [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s daughter! Although [From.GetTitledFirstName] had every right to be upset with me, [From.GetSheHe] offered no advice on how I could make this right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72097;Not long after the feast, my daughter started to get sick in the mornings and showed all symptoms of being with child. Her little flirt at the feast must have gotten her pregnant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72098;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s daughter is pregnant and [From.GetSheHe] demands that I marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72099;My son's flirt with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s daughter lead to an unexpected pregnancy and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] demands that my son marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72100;I had never thought my [GetFromRelation] would force me to marry the girl I seduced at the feast! She is pregnant and her father demands that I marry her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72109;I have given the orders for a Great Feast to be hosted in [Root.Location.GetName]. Let the preparations begin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72110;The last of the guests has returned home and everyone agreed it was this year's greatest feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72111;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast is over and it is time to begin the long way home. After the food, the entertainment and the warmth, the real world suddenly feels cold and hostile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72112;I have to cancel the feast due to the war I am currently fighting against one of my enemies. Perhaps after the war I might throw a victory feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72113;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], due to the unfortunate war I have to cancel the feast. I hope you will be able to attend the victory fest I plan to have after the war.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72115;I almost forgot to eat when I saw the acrobats performing during [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I was the first one to start applauding when their performance was done, wishing they would do just one more somersault, or cartwheel, or even tumble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72116;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plate was still almost full when the acrobats had finished their performance and [From.GetSheHe] applauded almost frantically with a blissed look in [From.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72120;The travelling dancers first danced for us and, while dancing to a fast and glad tune which made me want to dance, invited everyone to join them. I danced until I panted and my face was red, then I had to sit down and rest for a while, watching the dancers and the courtiers having more fun than in a long time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100520;No one would notice if I poisoned my rival's wine at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast, the guests would be too preoccupied with gossip, plots and schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100521;I poured the poison into the wine and made sure no one saw me switching the poisoned goblet with my rival's. My rival did not notice anything, too busy talking with [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and I was mentally congratulating myself when I heard someone swear and the clatter when the goblet hit the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100522;The wine tasted strange, it almost tingled on my tongue but it was quite passable. It wasn't until several hours later, when I started vomiting blood, that I realized the wine must have been poisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100523;The feast was exactly as I had planned it, plenty of food and wine, great entertainment and interesting guests. Too bad someone decided to ruin it for everyone by poisoning the wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100524;I watched as [From.GetTitledFirstName] downed the goblet with poisoned wine in a swallowing, burped and called for more. Satisfied, I sat down and enjoyed the food while waiting for the poison to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100525;Several witnesses claimed they had seen [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] pouring something into the wine and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] confessed soon enough when I confronted [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. Several guests became sick but thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] no one died, the poison in the wine was too diluted to cause anyone permanent damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100526;My father died from the wine [From.GetTitledFirstName] poisoned at [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast! I will avenge my father's death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100527;I confessed almost as soon as [From.GetTitledFirstName] started question me about the poisoned wine. My rival did not suffer at all from the poisoning but many guest had fallen ill after they had drunk the poisoned wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA72000;They will be perfect entertainment for the feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72001;I was just looking for some entertainment for my feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72002;I want to offer you my patronage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72003;I will spend lavishly on food;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72004;Just repair it, I don't care about the cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72005;I send Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] to deal with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72006;The guests would be impressed if they entertained at my feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72007;You must perform at my feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72008;Send out Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72009;You would be perfect for my feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72010;'I hereby invite you to...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72011;I will travel to the feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72012;Well I don't like you either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72015;Welcome to my feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72016;Thank you for having us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72020;These dishes are heavenly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72021;The food is great, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72022;The dishes reflects your temperance, well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72023;That was well spoken, thank you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72024;If you don't have something nice to say, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72025;I think I have made a new friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72026;[From.GetTitledFirstName] ish my besht friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72027;Our mutual dislike made us friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72028;The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72030;I challenge you to a duel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72031;Nonetheless, I accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72032;I managed to wound [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72033;...wounded on the ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72034;You disgust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72035;How could you!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72036;What on Earth have you done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72037;Don't just stand there, help [feast_duel_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72038;I try to get to them before it is too late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72039;That was sensible of [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72040;But we are both married...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72041;[From.GetFirstName] kissed me and we fell onto the bed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72042;...and now [From.GetFirstName]'s spouse [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] hates me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72045;More wine please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72046;Sorry! The wine do not agree with me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72047;What a foul smell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72048;I think I fell asleep at the table, the wine made me sleepy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72049;That's disgusting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72050;Can't [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] make sure the roads are safe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72051;I understand [From.GetHerHis] irritation over this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72052;How dare [From.GetTitledFirstName] insult me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72055;I should have made him pay for the garb before I killed him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72056;Imprison [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72057;Am I here because of a dead servant?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72060;That's it! Off to prison with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72061;Though, it was not suitable to throw the jester into the dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72062;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I applaud your patience;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72063;Your performance was splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72064;They were wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72065;Sing that ballad once more, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72066;I loved every minute of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72067;One more dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72068;I don't want to stop dancing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72069;I managed to save both my eyebrows this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72070;Bravo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72071;Give that back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72072;Do it again! Do it again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72075;I like to flirt, but I wouldn't do anything more than that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72076;[From.GetFirstName] kissed me and I kissed [From.GetHerHim] back and we ended up in the bed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72077;I don't regret that night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72080;I haven't ever met a more fascinating person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72081;We have to do this again, soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72085;Guards! Imprison that person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72086;Yes, I will grant you the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72087;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72088;I won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72089;The title will never be yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72090;It's fun to flirt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72091;My daughter made me proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72092;I will tell [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s father!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72093;Well, what can I do? Nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72094;There's nothing I can do about it now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72095;Is there anything I can do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72096;Let us forget this ever happened, eh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA72097;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] must marry my daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA100521;The poisoned wine... wasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100522;...kill... ...me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100523;If I find out who did it, they'll be more than sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100524;[From.GetTitledFirstName] died a slow and painful death from the poison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100525;Throw the poisoner into the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB72000;No, I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72001;You are not quite what I am looking for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72002;Not good enough, sorry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72003;Spend enough on food to satisfy everyone's hunger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72004;Let the guests suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB72011;I will attend this feast over my dead body!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72020;People are starving and you serve this abundance of food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72021;Where's the boar?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72022;Is this what you serve your guests? Shame on you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72030;I wouldn't want to spoil the feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72031;I don't want to spoil the feast, let us do this another time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72032;I managed to maim [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72033;...maimed on the ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72035;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72036;Excellent work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72037;[feast_duel_target.GetTitledFirstName] surely deserved it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72040;May I suggest we retreat to a more private place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72041;I kissed [From.GetFirstName] and we fell onto the bed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72045;No more wine for me, please;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72056;[From.GetSheHeCap] did the right thing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72060;I really shouldn't let [insulting_jester.GetHerHim] get on my nerves like this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72075;I'd like to show you the castle, especially my bedchamber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72076;We should return to the others now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72085;I have something important I need to discuss with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72086;I refuse to give you the title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72089;Wait... I'll give you the title, just let me out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72090;I'll give her a good tumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72092;[From.GetTitledFirstName], how could you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72097;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s son must marry my daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72098;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72099;My son will never marry your daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB72120;Great fun, but my guests are too old for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100520;I dare not, what if I was to be discovered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100522;The poison did not kill me, but it made me infirm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100524;The poison did not kill [From.GetTitledFirstName], only made [From.GetHerHim] infirm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC72008;I will hunt the boars myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC72021;This is good enough for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72022;It is not my place to criticise the food;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72033;...dead on the ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72035;I have nothing I want to say to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72036;Leave, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72037;Leave my feast, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72041;The awkwardness of the situation made me leave the room;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72056;Some gold will keep the servants quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72085;I have enough titles, I don't need one more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72092;Grovel to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s [FromFrom.GetFatherMother];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC72097;Hold my anger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC100522;The poison... it buuurns...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC100524;The poison made [From.GetTitledFirstName] sick as a pig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC100525;No one died, so I'll be merciful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD72003;I will see to it that we make use of existing recipes, for inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD72003_buddy_cannibal_tt;Your [potential_cannibal.GetRootRelation] takes charge of the administration of food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD72003_cannibal_tt;You find yourself unable to put the book down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
