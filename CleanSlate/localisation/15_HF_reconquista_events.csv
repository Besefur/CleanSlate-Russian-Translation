EVTDESC_HF_49207;It seems I have waited too long, as my men and all my preparation starts to come apart. It seems people lost faith in my plans, when I did not start any wars for Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49212;Magnanimous [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nYour plans to reconquer Iberia for Christianity inspires me to take up arms as well, and I will support your efforts to the best of my ability.\n\nYour ally,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49213;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI have declared a reconquest war on [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName], and I am looking forward to see you on the battlefield.\n\nSigned,\nYour ally, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49220;After leading troops on both sides of the wars raging throughout the Iberian Peninsula, I seem to have grown quite the reputation among the local peasants and soldiers on both sides.\n\nThough some would consider me a mercenary or a traitor to the faith, my prowess in war has made me a hero among most, and revered among the populace. Some would even go as far as to call me a folk hero.\n\nSurely, my actions must have been righteous, seeing all the responses. I have often wondered if it would all be worth it in the end, and it is a joyous occasion to see all my hard work has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49221;I have fought for the faith several times these recent years, to recapture the Iberian Peninsula  as a true vanguard for Christendom and its followers.\n\nThough we were occupied by the Moors of Al-Andalus invading from the south who forced their way into the heartlands of Christianity, we have pushed them out of our home. Step by step, we have regained what is rightfully ours.\n\nHispania will rise as a bastion of Christianity once more. We will make sure of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49230;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI have heard about your struggles against the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s, and I would like to assure you I do not share their animosity towards the [Root.Religion.GetName]s. For a small donation, I will be willing to help you out.\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49231;To the magnanimous [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI appreciate and accept your offer. I hope to be seeing you at the battlefield shortly.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49232;To the greedy [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nYour despicable offer disgusts me. I hope to see you at the battlefield next, so I can cut you down together with the rest of the infidels.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49233;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nYour prowess in war is well known throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and I would like to offer your a sum of gold for your services in the current Reconquest War.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49234;To the magnanimous [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI appreciate and accept your offer. I will be seeing you on the battlefield shortly.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49235;To the despicable [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI find it insulting that you would even dare think I would betray my fellow [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49241;There will probably be men showing up to fight for the faith in the upcoming wars for Iberia, but I could invest some money into spreading the message far and wide to attract more well trained troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49242;The wars for Iberia are costly, and it has made a noticeable dent into my finances. [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] has been a valiant supporter of our struggles for a long time, maybe it is time to ask [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] for help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49243;A massive creature of a [new_commander.GetManWoman] is brought in front of me, supposedly [new_commander.GetSheHe] has quite the renown as a commander. After seeing [new_commander.GetHerHis] interactions with some of my men, it is easy to see [new_commander.GetSheHe] knows what [new_commander.GetSheHe] is doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49244;A captain of a small fleet of ships appears at my court, trying to sell his services in the upcoming wars. Some of my commanders question the need for ships, but surely I could find a use for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49249;A year has passed since I started my preparations for the reconquest of Iberia, and I am sure that whoever wanted to take part in the reconquest would have arrived by now. Now all that remains is to find a place to point my newfound allies towards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49450;As the last in a long line of attempts to try to reconquer the Iberian Peninsula, [From.GetTitledName] has begun preparing [From.GetHerHis] troops and looking for allies for a new Iberian campaign. Trying to restore parts of the peninsula to Christendom, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent a noticeable amount of resources and sent out a call to gather troops from all around the region.\n\nWith the Christians planning for war, the other faiths have started assembling their troops to defend themselves. It is only a matter of months, or maybe a year, before the two sides will clash together once more, desperately trying to claw their way to more land in Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49451;With the rise of the [e_hispania.GetFullName], the Iberian Peninsula has come under total control of the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s. There was a long struggle between the different faiths occupying the peninsula, but the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] believers has finally conquered their adversaries.\n\nWith the struggle of the two sides finally put to rest, Iberia can finally start looking forward to a peaceful future, free of the wars that has raged through the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49452;Not even the Balearic Islands have been safe from the Christian reconquest of Iberia. The final bastions of the other faiths in the region have fallen, now there is only Christendom left.\n\nWith Iberia finally restored to the faithful, the reconquest of the peninsula has ended, and peace has been restored. Once more a cornerstone of the faith, Iberia is bound to play an important role for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49462;A minor noble has launched a campaign to start gathering troops to reconquer parts of Iberia. [From.GetTitledFirstName] asks for my help in supporting [From.GetHerHim], and taking part in the reconquest. This is a great opportunity to push back the infidels from Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49463;As the sponsor of the upcoming reconquest campaign, I have a prime opportunity to aid [FromFrom.GetDynName]. But in what manner will I help [FromFrom.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_49207;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49212;It is appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49213;As promised, we will do our part and help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49220;I will be remembered throughout the ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49221;Forward, brethren!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49230;Any help is needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49231;Raise your swords, men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49232;The insults were unnecessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49233;I think... Yes, that sounds like a good deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49234;Great! More allies are always needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49235;It seems I have to look elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49241;A small sum should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49242;A small donation is all I ask for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49243;I am sure you will fit right in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49244;I will happily take you up on the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49249;Now to find a fitting target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49450;Iberia belongs to Christianity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49451;Hispania will be a cornerstone of our faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49452;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49462;It would be my honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49463;I will use my renown to find [FromFrom.GetHerHim] a lot of troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_49230;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49233;And betray my fellow [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s? I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49241;We need to make sure everyone hears about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49242;I expect a proper donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49243;I got just the job for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49244;You would not happen to know more captains, would you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49450;The Christian rabble does not belong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49451;Cursed infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49462;Help a minor noble? I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49463;My connections with the clergy will prove invaluable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_49241;Take everything I have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49242;No no, it is all right, I do not need any help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49243;Actually, I think we do not need another commander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49244;We do not need ships to fight at land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49463;Wealth can topple any enemy and bless any ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HF_49241;Sadly, I cannot afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_HF_49463;Why would I help out more than I already have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
