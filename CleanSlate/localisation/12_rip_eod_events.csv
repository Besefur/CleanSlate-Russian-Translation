EVTDESC_RIP_14001;The people of [capital.GetName] have seen a lot of death and misery lately. As a result, doomsayers are getting more attention from those desperately looking for answers. Crowds gather to listen to raving lunatics speaking of the end of the world. If there is a solution, something to end this nightmare, your people will probably pursue any possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14004;These months of endless complaints and misery everywhere are simply too much to bear. I have no energy left to take on even the easiest tasks, and if this nightmare does not end soon I fear I may not endure it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14006;Your rival [rival.GetTitledName] keeps coming to mind even at times like these. [rival.GetHerHisCap] stupid laugh and arrogant ways are draining so much energy daily, maybe it is time to make use of the situation and have [rival.GetHerHim] pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14010;The moon fully eclipses the sun, creating a powerful sight which causes everyone to focus their attention on it. People are lighting fires to avoid the darkness, and overall they are terrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14012;[greedy_councillor.GetFirstName] beams a smile at you as [greedy_councillor.GetSheHe] presents you with the earnings from the desperate people of [capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14013;There is an angry mob looking for me claiming I made a pact with [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Nothing particular comes to mind that could have caused this. There is no way to stop and ask them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_14014;Barely escaping the angry mob I could gather that it was [FromFrom.GetTitledName] who sent them my way by claiming I had cursed [capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_RIP_14002;[greedy_councillor.GetFirstName], my [Root.GetChancellorName] suggests that I use this difficult time to get some extra income from our gullible commoners. If I can give [greedy_councillor.GetHerHim] a chance to speak, he will take only a small cut and let me have the rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_RIP_14015;[rival.GetTitledName] was caught and beaten to death by an angry peasant mob.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nIt could be that relieving them of material things caused their perspective to change. Or maybe it just coincided with misery not lasting forever. In any case, life will go on for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_RIP_11000;The horrific wound from your maiming is now stinking and oozing pus. The pain is debilitating and the courtiers are avoiding you like death itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nHaving a scapegoat like [rival.GetTitledName] might have helped in dealing with their grief, and in punishing [rival.GetHerHim] they perhaps felt like the problem was dealt with. It seems like everyone is happier with the current situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_RIP_14002;[greedy_councillor.GetFirstName], my [Root.GetTreasurerName] tells me in private that in times like these people are willing to give away a little bit more of their wealth to stay alive. If we can make them believe we can help them they should prove generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_RIP_14015;Although a mob of angry peasants went after [rival.GetHerHim], [rival.GetTitledName] had not been caught and have somehow figured out it was me who sent them there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nWhen [rival.GetTitledName] managed to evade harm and attention was turned towards me the commoners seem to have been distracted from their own misery. I may look worse in their eyes now, but death is not the only subject any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_RIP_14002;[greedy_councillor.GetFirstName], my [Root.GetSpymasterName] approaches me and wants to ease the purses of our people now that they are so willing to listen to others. Some medicine to help avoid illness could raise their hopes and grant us some much needed income.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nStraightening out their lives and being pure in the eyes of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] helped many feel like they will be saved, no matter what happens. Even if others are still dying, the rest show little fear for the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_RIP_14002;[greedy_councillor.GetFirstName], my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] mentions that in difficult times the faith of people are tested. If we were to press this issue to gain some extra donations to our cause, we could split the profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nNo thanks to my efforts apparently, according to some I contributed to an even worse outcome. I would like to think that my weakness made them feel a sense of independence, to find strength to act instead of just complain. They should be grateful, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_RIP_14020;The attitude for the majority of people in [capital.GetName] has changed. What was only spoken of as the 'end of days' has been changed into a tough, yet promising future.\n\nMy speech helped inspire many to fight through these difficulties and keep focusing on things that need to be done to make days better. One [Root.GetManWomanOpp] even came up to me and said I was very attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDSC_RIP_15100;Reliable sources say there is a noble in the realm claiming to be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] incarnate - they call [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHim] "the White Rider". For months, this betrayer has been out there rallying forces to [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] side to join some imaginary war against the whole mortal world. The rumors say [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetSheHe]'s seven feet tall and [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] voice can make the earth tremble beneath your feet. \n\nHowever, you know better than to trust such idle gossip. What's troubling is the amount of support garnered by this self-proclaimed prophet. Not to mention, it has been happening right under your nose - without revealing the White Rider's identity! What if this lunatic has the people on [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15101;The court is all astir with ideas of a new era coming - the righteous ones will be saved through fire! With the investigation into the White Rider ongoing I can make light of the situation, or take a firm stand on the matter of this delusional zealot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15103_A;Dear, [Root.GetFirstName].\nThe rumors around [Root.Capital.GetName] are worrisome. Do the people really believe in the end of days? Is there a cult growing? I worry something is coming, for us all. I beg you put an end to this ruckus, sooner rather than later.\n\nKind regards,\n[EoD_worried_one.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15103_B;Honored [Root.GetTitledName].\nThe rumors from [Root.Capital.GetName] are troublesome. My couriers claim that a cult is growing - there are tales of a reckoning and the end of days? I humbly suggest you put an end to this madness, sooner rather than later.\n\nSincerely,\n[EoD_worried_one.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15103_C;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nThe rumors from [Root.Capital.GetName] are troublesome... Is it true, has your rule spawned a cult for the end of days? I've long dreamt of your demise and I believe it is coming for you now. That it will be your own people disposing of you... That I did not foresee!\n\nSincerely,\n[EoD_worried_one.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15104;The court is in a state of disarray and I hear yelling outside. "T-troops, my [Root.GetLordLady]", a servant stutters, panic in his eyes. There appears to be a large military force amassing outside our gates - their banner that of the White Rider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15105;The guards throw the leader to the floor before me. So this is the mad [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetManWoman] who's been agitating the realm.\n"The righteous shall be spared from the flame. If you are pure, you have nothing to fear from me!" [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetSheHe] proclaims passionately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15106;To the respected [Root.GetBestName],\nBy now, I have left my estate. You should know, I never wanted a title. However, you are not the first person to fail to see the truth. I will pray for you, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. May the heavens spare you from the fire.\n\nSincerely,\n[EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15107_A;They found [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHim] hanging from a tree, on a hill near the capital. I'm told that the risk of [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetFirstName] becoming a martyr for [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] cause is slim, yet I'm not at peace. I still haven't read the letter that was left for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15107_B;They found [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHim] hanging from a beam in [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] cell. My scholars tell me that the risk of [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName] becoming a martyr for [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHis] cause is slim, yet I'm not at peace. I still haven't read the letter that was left for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15108_A;I had to test my theory! If I am right, no harm will come to me. But if you are reading this, I am in the arms of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Or maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]... Then I... I am truly mad and the War of Reckoning would have killed your people. Forgive me.\n\nSincerely,\n[EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15108_B;If you are reading this, I am in the arms of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Or maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]... Either way, it means that I was wrong and the war of reckoning would have killed your people. Thank you for stopping me. I can't tell the voices apart anymore.\n\nI am so sorry,\n[EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15109;The pyre was lit, and the flame were just about to take care of [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetFirstName] when a group of hooded figures attacked, daggers glinting in the light of the fire. Their prophet of doom was cut loose, and in the chaos that errupted [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetSheHe] slipped away! They're calling [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHim] "the Survivor".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15110;To [Root.GetBestName],\nI believe you acted the way expected of you. I do not blame you. But not even [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] can help you if you stray too far from the path laid out before you. Stay vigilant! And take care of your people.\n\nSincerely,\n[EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15111;All I wanted to do was to check in on my doomsday prophet prisoner, [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName], yet when I arrived the jailor scratched his head and mumbled awkwardly: "That, uh, White Rider character... Well, there's no easy way to put this. [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetSheHeCap]'s gone.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15112;I killed them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15113;[EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetBestName] has been acclimatizing well to the life I've set up for [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetHerHim]. I'm starting to wonder whether that whole White Rider thing was just an elaborate grab for attention. [EoD_doomsday_prophet.GetSheHeCap] is actually quite pleasant to be around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15115;Your sword raised and your spirits high, you charged the field of rebellious zealots. In the mayhem that followed [From.GetFirstName] soon locked eyes with you, a mix of defiance and excitement on [From.GetHerHis] face. The action slowly dispersed around the two of you fighting, until the outcome of the battle was clear to come down to this one duel - the White Rider, the prophet of doom, versus the [Root.GetTitledName].\n\nIn retrospect, you are saddened by the fact that there was no bard present to chronicle the magnificent victory you claimed against this foe. If nothing else, at least the war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_15116;Their torches lit and swords raised, the White Rider and [From.GetHerHis] army fought with a passion reminiscent of the heroes of old. When [From.GetSheHe] finally met [From.GetHerHis] maker it was by accident - according to eye witnesses [From.GetSheHe] tripped on a fallen comrade, piercing [From.GetHerselfHimself] on a broken spear. With hands thrown out in appeal to the heavens, it is said that [From.GetHerHis] final expression was one of utter disbelief.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] legacy will probably not live up to [From.GetHerHis] own delusions of grandeur, but you take comfort in knowing that the War of Reckoning has ended with the demise of [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDSC_RIP_22000;At first there were only rumors, but now no one can deny the disease ravaging the world. Streets and fields all over your realm lay barren. Some of your subjects have escaped the worst afflicted areas while many others have succumbed and paid the ultimate price. \n\nNow new rumors are starting to spread. They say that the dead are rising from the mass graves to walk the earth once more. There have even been whispers of these undying corpses attacking the living. So far nothing has been confirmed, and you have publicly branded the reports as falsehood. However, secretly, you are not convinced. The last terrible rumors did turn out to be true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22001;My guards inform me that a mob of peasant has gathered outside my gates, and it is growing by the hour. Their leader is demanding an audience with me. Apparently it has something to do with the recent rumors of living corpses. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22003;The peasant leader, who goes by the name [end_peasant_leader.GetFirstName], is a ghastly sight! He claims to have been bitten by one of the living dead and barely escaped with his life. He begs that I take action and save my people from this terrible scourge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22005;A crying peasant woman has been brought before me. Her little child had been ill and was mistakenly slain in the hunt for the living dead. My advisors tell me that this is not the only case and the people are growing resentful towards their "protectors".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22006;I hear [end_peasant_leader.GetFirstName] has been preaching about aiding the afflicted and has amassed quite a following over the last few months. While the fear of the living dead has dissipated substantially, the pendulum has swung in the other direction and now many are happily interacting with the sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22007;Everything went according to plan. My agents disposed of [end_peasant_leader.GetFirstName] and made it appear as if he abandoned his disciples. They already seem to have lost heart as a consequence. Hopefully this will slow the spread of the disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22008;The agents I sent to deal with [end_peasant_leader.GetFirstName] certainly killed him, but they also made a grand spectacle of it. Now all of his followers know that I am to blame and despite by best efforts towards damage control, the word is spreading like wildfire. They have painted me quite the villain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22009;Despite your efforts to handle the situation - or perhaps exactly because of them - the situation in your realm has doubtlessly gotten out of hand. It is no longer within your power to rein in the fear and anger of your people. They are turning on each other, neighbors slaying neighbors, friends betraying friends. Sometimes the motivations behind these killings are nothing more than a simple cough or wound. \n\nIt is clear to you now that the rumors about the living dead were never true, though it matters little. Many innocents lost their life to persecution, rather than the disease itself. The streets will not be crowded again for many years to come. The scars in your subjects' minds will likely last much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22010;Your inability to handle the threat of the "living dead" has left your realm shaken and shattered. While the rumors turned out to be false, the disease has still ravaged your lands. Many fields and orchards lay abandoned in the countryside, and in the towns crowded streets are a rare sight. Those who are left struggle hard to make ends meet. You and your court is no exception. Not even [Root.GetTitle]s are immune to the touch of Death. \n\nWhen will the nightmare end, you ask yourself. Who knows? Perhaps it must get even worse before things turn around for the better. All you know for certain is that the streets will not be crowded again for many years to come. The scars in your subjects' minds, however, will likely last much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_22011;These have been hard days, no one can deny it, but perhaps the worst has passed. The rumors concerning the living dead have all but ceased. It seems like the pale, twisted specters which have haunted your realm were nothing but sick people. Most of them were not even aggressive, despite the claims of the mob. While the sick still pose a danger to others, the fear is not so great as before, and the situation has been handled in the best way you could hope for. \n\nAll is not over yet, however. The realm might have pulled through this panic, but the disease is still claiming lives. There is no rest nor respite until the epidemic is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
