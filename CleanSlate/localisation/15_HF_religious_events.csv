EVTTITLE23213;The Legend of [From.GetFirstNameWithNick];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE23434;Harbinger of the Blood Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE23435;Realm of Blood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF23007;Before our troops can test their mettle against our enemies, we must be sure that the gods are in favor of this war. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered all [From.GetHerHis] instruments and is ready to perform the divination on my offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23008;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the bull in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through his entrails. The response is quite clear. The gods favor our cause in the war to come! The troops will fight with renewed strength now that they know for sure that our victory has been ordained from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23009;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the bull in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through his entrails. The signs are not entirely clear, but the diviner assures me that there was no signs of the Fates opposing our war. Our troops will surely be comforted by knowing that the gods are not against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23010;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the bull in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through his entrails. Unfortunately, the response from the diviner is not as positive as I hoped. There are clear signs that the gods are not in favor of this war. This news will not be good for morale...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23011;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the bull in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through his entrails. The response is terrible. Not only are the gods against us in this war but, according to the signs interpreted by the diviner, they seem to be favoring our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23021;I was told many time when I was growing up of how the stars are influencing my behavior, but now I am no longer sure of it. Was it just stories grown-ups were telling me to make me feel special?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23022;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has taken a deep interest in the circumstances of [From.GetHerHis] birth and in the constellations affecting [From.GetHerHis] destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23023;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] warned me that I worry too much about the stars and that I should not let the circumstances of my birth affect my judgment on present events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23024;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] praised me today for paying the due respect to the heavens and taking a healthy interest in astrology and the influence that the stars have on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Aquarius, a constellation commonly associated with introversion and eccentricity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23026;I walk amongst the ruins of one of the greatest civilizations to ever grace this world. I should take the opportunity to study in detail the history and the glorious accomplishments of those that came before us if I ever wish to emulate their feats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23027;I did my best, but my attempts to study the history of the Roman Empire were not as successful as I hoped. Most accounts I was able to access are fragmented and confusing. I don't think I was able to learn anything valuable after all these months of study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23028;I am fascinated by the legends of the old gods worshiped by Romans and Greeks in the past. Their capricious and passionate nature differs so much from [catholic.GetHighGodName]'s unknowable and contradictory designs... Their plots and rivalries certainly offer a better explanation for the chaotic state of our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23029;In these past months I have immersed myself in the fragmented accounts of Caesar's military exploits against the Gauls. It has been an enlightening learning experience and I am sure that, despite the difference in equipment and sizes, I can apply some of his tactics against my own enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23030;In these past months I have immersed myself in the fragmented accounts of some of Rome's greatest statesmen. Reading the works of Emperor Justinian and of his reformation of the Roman legal code in particular has been an eye-opening experience for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23031;In these past months I have immersed myself in the fragmented accounts of some of Rome's finest orators. Reading through the treaties of Cicero and other great sophists has allowed me to learn a lot about the fine art of diplomacy and politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23101;For centuries the Church has had free reign to lord over Rome, the ancient capital of my Empire. The influence of the Papacy looms still over the city, as its many churches can attest. Perhaps it is time to reaffirm the authority of the Empire over the Church in incontrovertible terms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23102;In order to stamp out any remaining rebellious aspirations and punish past insults against the Empire, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the destruction of the Holy See itself. After having priests and prelates abandon their churches in a hurry, barely giving them enough time to recover relics and books, [From.Culture.GetName] soldiers consigned the holy buildings to the flames.\nThis abominable act is certain to permanently cripple the authority of the Catholic Church for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23106;I have restored the Empire, a feat worthy of immortal glory, yet now doubts beset my mind. How can I ensure that this Empire will not fall like it did in the past? When looking for the causes that fragmented and destroyed the old Empire, there is only one thing that appears to be constant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23107;Could it be possible that, by embracing the barbaric Eastern religion of Christ, Emperor Theodosius weakened the Empire, and that, conversely, I might be able to strengthen it by reintroducing the worship of the old gods? My decision could just as easily doom the Empire a second time as I attempt to save it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23108;[Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have come to the conclusion that Our predecessors' attachment to the barbaric cult of the Galileans is inextricably tied to the fall of this great Empire of ours, and I have come to the resolution that, in order to truly restore the glory of Rome, we must also restore its ancient religion.\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23109;I shall not be part of this farce. I am a §Y[From.Religion.GetName]§!, and I will not abandon my faith in [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23110;I am happy to stand right beside you for the resurgence of the §YHellenic§! faith, my [Root.GetTitle].\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23111;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI have come to the conclusion to abide by the new Imperial decree and convert to the Hellenic faith. I expect all my subordinates to follow me in this decision.\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23112;The great celebrations across the Christian world after the restoration of the Roman Empire at the hands of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have been cut short by a terrifying and unexpected turn of events. The new [From.GetTitle] has determined that Christianity is a barbarous and seditious cult that has no place in [From.GetHerHis] new Empire. \nIn an effort to rebuild the past glory of Rome in its entirety, [From.GetSheHe] has forsaken [From.GetHerHis] faith in favor of worshiping the old pagan gods of [From.GetHerHis] ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23118;The Civil War has ended, and [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] has reaffirmed [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] authority as our rightful [FromFromFrom.GetTitle]. Perhaps it is time I reconsidered my choice and embraced Hellenism, lest I suffer the [FromFromFrom.GetTitle]'s wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23119;As expected, the reintroduction of ancient Roman law and customs has not been well received by the Galilean moralizers. An entire coalition of Christian priests has petitioned me to put a stop to these new excesses to prevent the damnation of my subjects' souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23212;Many brave Norsemen sail from Scandinavia in search for glory and riches in the prosperous lands of the West. Only a few return from their travels as heroes, but even their stories pale in comparison to mine. \nMy palace is filled with the countless trophies I have gathered through a lifetime of endless plundering. I have laid waste of scores of towns, killed thousands, brought entire realms to their knees... \nThe land-dwellers scare children by telling stories about my exploits, while the Skalds of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] swear that I must be the son of an Aesir, animated by an unquenchable thirst for blood and conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23214;My warriors are already sprawling through the streets of [From.GetName] to take their hard-fought loot, when I receive news that there is still a pocket of defenders hiding in the area. It is a small band of mercenaries, led by a [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetManWoman] called [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetFirstName]. Their leader claims that [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetSheHe] has no quarrel with us, and would in fact be ready to join my army for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23215;It is not hard to persuade [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetFirstName]. All it takes is a few kind words, firm hands and some time alone in a burned-out hut. Once I am done with [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetHerHim], [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetSheHe] is more than willing to follow my army for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23216;For whatever reason, [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetFirstName] does not look interested in what I have to offer [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetHerHim]. In fact, my attempts to reach a better arrangement has only managed to upset [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23217;[scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetFirstName]'s band has grown weary of following me. They claim that they are not receiving their rightful share of loot from our raids. If I do not bribe them with some of my treasure, they will surely leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23218;Having proven my worth by defeating their leader, the remaining mercenaries have flocked under my banner, fearing to meet the same end as their former commander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23219;There must be some way to force open the defenses of [From.GetName]. With control over both land and sea, I have a distinct advantage over the defenders of this fortress. I only need to think of a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23220;With attackers coming from both land and sea, the defenders of [FromFrom.GetName] are unable to divide their attention between our assaults. My raiders are able to slip through their palisades and kill many of them before being repelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23221;Unfortunately, dividing my men between land and sea proved to be a bad decision. The defenders of [FromFrom.GetName] were able to repel our assault before we could cause any significant damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23222;With just a few robes and some well-placed bribes, I was able to sneak inside [FromFrom.GetName] with a few veteran warriors. Now that the priests are busy tending to their rites, we have the perfect opportunity to raid this temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23223;Unfortunately, the priests were able to see through our disguise. While their attempt to capture us failed miserably, when we returned to the camp to bring the news to the rest of the band, the other raiders were not happy to see we had returned empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23224;Convincing the guards to let me through might have not been my most dignified moment, but the trick worked. I was able to slip past their defenses and open the gates to the rest of my men, who quickly rushed inside. We killed many of [FromFrom.GetName]'s defenders before being forced to retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23225;Unfortunately, I was unable to convince the guards to let me through. After a while, I was forced to leave entirely before risking to raise their suspicions too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23226;My raiders scattered through the countryside, pillaging the villages and farms nearby [FromFrom.GetName] and returning at nightfall to our camp, their bags filled with food and other loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23227;Unfortunately, my raiders returned to the camp empty-handed. Apparently they were unable to find anything of substance in the farms around [FromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23400;After having consulted with some of the world's most respected diviners and having analyzed sightings from several realms, I have come to the conclusion that we are entering into a new prosperous age. \nThe skies are clear, the weather is stable, and the stars have aligned favorably, ensuring stability, abundance and overall good luck throughout the land.\nBeing the [Root.GetTitle], it is my duty to spread the good news to all the great [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23401;We have just received news from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. A most revered congregation of diviners under the leadership of our [From.GetTitle] have analyzed the stars and many prodigious heavenly sightings happening all over the world in the past months, and have reached the conclusion that a period of unbridled prosperity is upon us.\nThe skies are clear, the weather is stable, and the stars have aligned favorably, ensuring stability, abundance and overall good luck throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23402;It looked like such a clear, sunny day... Yet, just as I stepped outside of my palace, a sudden flash of light enveloped me, sending shivers down my spine and filling my ears with an unsettling ringing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23403;The most disturbing news is spreading through the realm. Our revered [From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently died, struck by lightning during a sunny day. \nPeople are clamoring that this is surely a sign of divine wrath towards [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23404;After spending the last year scrutinizing the stars, looking for divine signs, I am confident that the realm is about to enter a period of prosperity and stability. I should inform my liege about my findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23405;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that, after a careful analysis of the celestial bodies, [From.GetSheHe] has come to the conclusion that our realm is favored by the stars and is about to enter a period of prosperity and good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23406;It looked like such a clear, sunny day... Yet, just as I stepped outside of my palace, a sudden flash of light enveloped me, sending shivers down my spine and filling my ears with an unsettling ringing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23411;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was a notable and prestigious [From.GetManWoman]. My priests are of the opinion that performing a divination on [From.GetHerHis] very entrails would yield much more accurate results than on any other lesser creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23412;The flesh of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] filled me with unearthly strength. As I consumed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] entrails, the gods sent me a prophetic vision, assuring me of a great victory in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23413;Although [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s flesh did not grant me any greater insight on the future of my realm, it did give me solace from my recent sickness. Clearly, the gods wished me to consume it in order to regain my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23414;Although [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s flesh did not grant me any greater insight on the future of my realm, it cleared my mind and awakened my body. Clearly, the gods wished me to consume it in order to regain my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23415;Unfortunately, consuming my enemy's entrails did not allow me to hear the voice of the gods. It is [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] who started speaking instead. [FromFrom.GetHerHisCap] vengeful spirit has taken place within my head, tormenting me with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] incessant yelling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23416;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Their final verdict is that a great military victory is in store in my near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23417;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Little by little, they are able to read the names of several people who wish me ill and are plotting against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23418;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Little by little, they are able to read several secrets held by my enemies through the knotted remains of the dead [FromFrom.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23419;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Their final verdict is that the gods were very satisfied by [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s death and will reward my realm with prosperity and good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23420;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Unfortunately, they are unable to read anything meaningful from the corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23421;The diviners rummage intently through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails for about an hour, soiling the temple's floor with blood and gastric fluids, while I supervise them from a safe distance. Unfortunately, their final verdict is that the gods have been insulted by my sacrifice and will surely curse me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23422;By taking the lead on my diviners rummaging through [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s entrails and examining every nob and knot, I am able to discern the most endearing of results. It appears that the gods were extremely pleased by my sacrifice and have elected me to be the champion of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23431;I leave the altar with my clothes still dripping of the blood of my last victim. After having officiated a few sacrificial rites, I have found that my hands are much steadier, and that my heart is much more impervious to the incoherent pleas of my offerings to the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23432;There might have been a time when the sight of blood unsettled me, or when the wailing of a child could make my dagger quake and fill my mind with dread. \nBut not any longer. \nThe gods have granted me the fortitude to perform their sacred work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23433;The crowd below me cheers as the head of my last sacrifice rolls down the steps of the temple. I throw the heart in the sacred brazier, watching it hiss and burn and singing praises to the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23434;[Root.Religion.GetName] priests are notorious throughout the world for their sanguinary practices. The many sacrifices performed in the name of our gods are an imperative necessity, a grim responsibility that every pious man must take part in if we wish to avoid the terrible wrath of our immortal masters.\nYet, few can deny that my accomplishments in sating the gods' eternal thirst tower above those of all my colleagues.\nThrough my faith and dedication, I have cleansed the entirety of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a sea of blood, forging a sacred legacy that will not soon be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23435;[From.Religion.GetName] priests are notorious throughout the world for their sanguinary practices. The barbaric sacrifices performed in the name of their gods are a notorious staple of their dogma.\nAnd yet, in spite of their infamy, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to surprise the world with [From.GetHerHis] unfathomable atrocities. \nIn [From.GetHerHis] twisted quest for the blessing of [From.GetHerHis] immortal masters, this vile murderer has forged a realm of blood and skulls, slaughtering thousands of innocent and feeding their souls to [From.GetHerHis] monstrous gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23440;It is decided. In a few weeks, a great tournament shall be held to honor the gods. Of the many who will fight, only one will be acclaimed as the chosen of the gods, while the others will be immolated to sate the eternal thirst for blood of our immortal masters and protect the rest of us from their wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23441;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou have been invited formally invited to assist to the next blood games organized by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. As a member of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility, you are encouraged to contribute with fighters from your own dungeons and court.\n\nDistinct Salutations\n[From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23442;I will be glad to assist in the next §YBlood Games§!, my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23443;The gods are sure to show their appreciation to the patron of the warrior who will emerge victorious in the blood games. I should make sure to pick the best candidate to represent my dynasty in the arena...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23444;I have been picked to participate to the next Blood Games that are being organized by my jailers to honor the gods. I have no choice in the matter, but the guards assure me that, if I manage to survive, I will earn my freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23445;[my_blood_contender.GetTitledFirstName] will need all the help [my_blood_contender.GetSheHe] can get in order to survive the Blood Games. Perhaps I should try to invest a bit more in [my_blood_contender.GetHerHis] equipment before sending [my_blood_contender.GetHerHim] off to the slaughtering grounds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23447;With [From.GetTitledFirstName] no longer in my dungeons, I have been left without a fighter to represent my dynasty's faith to the gods in the upcoming blood games. Still, there is a little time left, if I wish to find somebody else to pick up [From.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23449;With [From.GetTitledFirstName] dead, I have been left without a fighter to represent my dynasty's faith to the gods in the upcoming blood games. Still, there is a little time left, if I wish to find somebody else to pick up [From.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23451;Unfortunately, the gods did not have the patience to wait for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Blood Games, and decided to instead reap [From.GetHerHis] very soul last night. Without [From.GetHerHis] patronage, it would appear that the entire tournament has been canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23452;Scores of criminals, slaves and desperate souls have gathered in the arena of [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to earn the blessing of the gods by becoming the champion of the tournament. I take my place of honor, alongside the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility and wait as the priests finish consecrating the ground before the beginning of the games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23453;Scores of criminals, slaves and desperate souls have gathered in the arena of [From.Capital.GetName], hoping to earn the blessing of the gods by becoming the champion of the tournament. I take my place of honor, alongside the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility and wait as the priests finish consecrating the ground before the beginning of the games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23454;The crowd roars in approval as another warrior falls to the ground, defeated. The weakest contenders have been quickly disposed of, leaving space for the more experienced fighters, and blessing the ground of the arena with their blood. Soon, their remains will be burned to honor the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23455;It was a gruesome trial to say the least, but, as I look up from the mangled remains of my last opponent and bask in the cheering of the crowd, my heart is filled with relief. I have emerged victorious from the Blood Games, proving my worth to the murderous gods of [From.Capital.GetName] and earning eternal glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23456;As my opponent pushes me on the ground and stomps on my wrist, a flash of pain courses through my body, making me lose my weapon. The crowd cheers and my opponent leaves. Then, the priests come, dragging me away from the arena and towards the bloodied altar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23457;As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [FromFrom.GetHerHim] for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] victory. Even though [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was not my offering, through [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, placating their ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23458;Now that I have abandoned the murderous cult of the [From.GetName] followers, I can finally see how horrible the idea of a blood tournament really is, and I have therefore decided to cancel the event immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23459;With [From.GetHerHis] recent conversion, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided that the Blood Games are a barbarous and terrible practice and has therefore decided to cancel the tournament [From.GetSheHe] had been organizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23460;As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [From.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] victory. Through [From.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, and by [From.GetHerHis] victory, [From.GetSheHe] has undoubtedly blessed the name of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23462;Victory cannot be achieved without the protection of the gods. If we wish to prevail against our enemies, we must be willing to make the required sacrifices. Once the gods have been appeased, they will unleash their terrible power against our foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23463;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. With such a large offering, we are sure to prevail against our foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23464;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. [From.GetHerHisCap] fanatic obsession with human sacrifice will doom us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23465;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that the gods will now grant [From.GetHerHis] armies the strength necessary to defeat my warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23466;With my champion dead, I have been left without a fighter to represent my dynasty's faith to the gods in the upcoming blood games. Still, there is a little time left, if I wish to find somebody else to rise up to the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23470;By carving this imposing Irminsul Tree, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and fierce gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23471;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the construction of a great monument to worship the old gods and garner their favor. This magnificent shrine has been erected in [From.Capital.GetName], where many shamans, fortunetellers and petitioners have already started to gather, hoping to receive a divine vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23473;As my soldiers overrun the province, I receive a report regarding a curious shrine built at the center of [From.GetName]. Apparently, the local tribes have erected it to garner the favor of their gods, and consider it to be a most sacred symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23474;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has laid waste of the Great Pillar of [From.GetName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] soldiers have torn down this sacred monument to the old gods. Having proved unable to protect their holy shrine, we have proven ourselves unworthy of the favor of the gods, who have surely turned their backs on us after this ignominious event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23476;For too long I have allowed this old, blasphemous relic to pollute my lands and cast its grotesque shadow upon the good people of [From.GetName]. The wailing of the few stubborn old believers fill the air as my soldiers tear down the pillar and scatter its remains to the open fields, never to be found ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23477;It was only a matter of time before the [From.Religion.GetName] followers torn down the old idol of [FromFrom.GetName]. [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guards have come today, in the early afternoon, announcing that the great pillar was a blasphemous remnant of a dead cult and needed to be removed forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23751;I am concerned about the health of poor [From.GetFirstName]. This realm requires a strong and healthy heir in order to prosper, yet my my child was not born under the best stars. It is my duty as a responsible [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle] to take all possible precautions in order to ensure a smooth succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23752;Despite [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sickly birth, the horoscope guarantees an almost certain recovery for little [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. And not only that! The child has clearly been born under very auspicious stars and is likely to become a great leader!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23753;Inspecting the child's horoscope has revealed that, despite [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sickly birth, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] will likely grow into a healthy and strong [FromFrom.GetManWoman], fully capable of ruling over my realm after I have moved to the next world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23754;Unfortunately, a closer inspection of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s horoscope has revealed that my concern was fully warranted. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was born under ominous signs. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] will be plagued by bad luck and waning health for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] entire life, dooming [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reign to be a short one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23755;Unfortunately, a closer inspection of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s horoscope has revealed that my concern was fully warranted. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was born under ominous signs. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] will be plagued by bad luck and waning health for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] entire life, dooming [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reign to be a short one, bereft with famine and strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23760;Being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle] is no easy task. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] expect me to be a just and competent ruler. By neglecting my duties, I would only betray the loyalty of my subjects, and jeopardize the longterm stability of this great realm of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23761;Thanks to my relentless efforts, I have achieved a greater understanding of politics than I ever thought possible. With these newfound diplomatic skills I will ensure peace and prosperity throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for years to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23762;Dynastic names, family ties, political agreements, proper court manners... I hastily excuse myself from my council, my mind feverishly tormented by all the new information I am trying to assimilate. I really wished to learn more about ruling a realm, but all these rules and social cues are simply too intricate, too contradicting, too many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23763;Ever since I started helping [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetFirstName] has not quite been the same. Drawn by a newly-awakened desire for knowledge, [From.GetSheHe] has increasingly neglected [From.GetHerHis] appearance. The more vacuous elements of the court have started maligning [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] stench and slobby demeanor, yet [From.GetSheHe] has found a steadfast supporter in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23764;Ever since I had to abandon some of my more frivolous habits in order to focus on my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], I have noticed that several courtiers have begun to avoid me. Most turn their nose up at my unwashed hair and worn-out clothes, yet I have found a kindred spirit in [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName]. [scoped_kindred.GetSheHeCap] truly understands me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23765;I glimpse at [From.GetFirstName] from my place at the table, looking as my [GetFromRelation] hoards as much food as [From.GetSheHe] can on [From.GetHerHis] plate before hastily excuses [From.GetHerselfHimself] to return to [From.GetHerHis] study. A more frivolous person than I might judge [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] recent changes, but I understand all too well the burdens of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23766;Noting my sour expression as the weaver tightens the string around my gut in order to measure my size for a new clothes I have ordered, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] hastily assures me that it is perfectly understandable, and laudable even, for a [Root.GetTitle] to focus on [Root.GetHerHis] duties to the realm, even when it comes at the expense of private concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23767;[From.GetTitledFirstName] absentmindedly orders the servant to carry away the half-finished meal on [From.GetHerHis] desk, too enthralled by our conversation to finish eating. All these late nights and skipped meals have given [From.GetHerHim] the lanky appearance of a [From.GetManWoman] that is truly devoted to [From.GetHerHis] work, and I could not be happier for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23768;The effects of my newfound dedication to my duties as [Root.GetTitle] has not passed unnoticed at court. Many seem to be concerned about my new slender look and pale complexion, yet I have had a steadfast supporter in [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName]. [scoped_kindred.GetSheHeCap] truly understands and appreciates the value of my sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23769;Perhaps I was too harsh on my [GetFromRelation] when trying to tutor [From.GetHerHim]. I have put too much pressure on [From.GetFirstName] and obtained the opposite result of what I was hoping. Overwhelmed by all [From.GetHerHis] new responsibilities, [From.GetSheHe] has become an unfocused, broken mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23773;I will soon no longer be a [Root.GetBoyGirl]. The time has come for me to perform the rite of passage that will mark the beginning of my adulthood. The shamans assure me that the larger and louder the ceremony is, the more likely the spirits will be to bless me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23774;A large crowd has reunited around my palace, waiting for me to emerge as a grown [Root.GetManWoman]. The sound of chanting, cymbals and drums echoes all the way to my chambers while I prepare myself. The shamans warned me that this is a delicate and dangerous transition when the spirits roam closer to the world of the living, and that I should be careful not to anger the wrong ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF23007;Before our troops can test their mettle against our enemies, we must be sure that the gods are in favor of this war. My haruspex has gathered all his instruments and is ready to perform the divination on my offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23008;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the cow in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through her entrails. The response is quite clear. The gods favor our cause in the war to come! The troops will fight with renewed strength now that they know for sure that our victory has been ordained from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23009;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the cow in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through her entrails. The signs are not entirely clear, but the diviner assures me that there was no signs of the Fates opposing our war. Our troops will surely be comforted by knowing that the gods are not against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23010;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the cow in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through her entrails. Unfortunately, the response from the diviner is not as positive as I hoped. There are clear signs that the gods are not in favor of this war. This news will not be good for morale...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23011;[Root.GetHaruspexName] cuts the cow in half. While the beast's head is immolated, the diviner starts rummaging through her entrails. The response is terrible. Not only are the gods against us in this war but, according to the signs interpreted by the diviner, they seem to be favoring our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23022;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be unwilling to take into consideration the circumstances of [From.GetHerHis] birth and the constellations affecting [From.GetHerHis] destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23023;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] praised me for not focusing too much on astrology at the expenses of my better judgment. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23024; My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] decided to scold me today for my lack of interest in astrology. [From.GetSheHeCap] warned me that I should always pay mind to the influence that stars have over people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Aries, a constellation commonly associated with fierceness and honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23101;Even now that the Christians have been driven out of the great and ancient city of Rome, the monuments to their God still persist, challenging my authority as [Root.GetTitle]. I have only one option if I wish to truly claim Rome for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23102;In a flagrant act of disrespect and carelessness for tradition and culture, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the destruction of the Holy See itself. After having priests and prelates abandon their churches in a hurry, barely giving them enough time to recover relics and books, [From.Culture.GetName] soldiers consigned the holy buildings to the flames.\nThis abominable act is certain to permanently cripple the authority of the Catholic Church for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23119;The higher standards of living that many of my subjects have had access to since the restoration of the Empire have caused the ire of a few moralizers amongst my Christian subjects. A group of petitioners from the Church's clergy has pleaded me to put a stop to these new, luxurious customs, as they are detrimental to my people's salvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23212;Many brave Norsemen sail from Scandinavia in search for glory and riches in the prosperous lands of the West. Only a few return from their travels as heroes, but even their stories pale in comparison to mine. \nMy palace is filled with the countless trophies I have gathered through a lifetime of endless plundering. I have laid waste of scores of towns, killed thousands, brought entire realms to their knees... \nThe land-dwellers scare children by telling stories about my exploits, while the Skalds of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] swear that I must be nothing less than a Valkyr, descended from Valhalla to quench my thirst for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23215;It is not hard to persuade [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetFirstName]. All it takes is a revealing gesture here and there, a well-placed compliment and some time alone in a burned-out hut. Once I am done with [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetHerHim], [scoped_pirate_mercenary.GetSheHe] is more than willing to follow my army for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23219;There must be some way to get into [From.GetName]. The city might be well defended, but with control over both land and sea, I have a distinct advantage over my opponents, while they have to defend a very large area of territory. I only need to think of a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23400;After having consulted with some of the world's most respected diviners and having analyzed sightings from several realms, I have come to the conclusion that we are entering into a favorable period of our time. \nThe skies are clear, the weather is stable, no misalignment of the heavenly bodies threatens us with doom.\nBeing the [Root.GetTitle], it is my duty to communicate these good findings to all the notable [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23401;We have just received news from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. A most revered congregation of diviners under the leadership of our [From.GetTitle] have analyzed the stars and many prodigious heavenly sightings happening all over the world in the past months, and have reached the conclusion that a period of good luck and stability is approaching us.\nThe skies are clear, the weather is stable, no misalignment of the heavenly bodies threatens us with doom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23402;The fire started during the night, just as I finished my last function. All the other priests had already left the building, leaving me alone and with no help. \nI clutch my holy symbol, languishing in a corner as the flames and smoke draw near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23403;The most disturbing news is spreading through the realm. Our revered [From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently died, consumed by a fire that destroyed [From.GetHerHis] great temple. \nPeople are clamoring that this is surely a sign of divine wrath towards [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23404;After spending the last year scrutinizing the stars, looking for divine signs, I have come to the conclusion that the future of the realm is uncertain and that there might be supernatural threats looming over the horizon. I should inform my liege about my findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23405;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that, after a careful analysis of the celestial bodies, [From.GetSheHe] has come to the conclusion that our realm is entering a phase of uncertainty and uneasiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23406;The fire started during the night, just as I finished my hearing. Despite all my yelling, no guard came to my rescue. \nAs I languish in a corner, the flames and smoke draw nearer and nearer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23435;[From.Religion.GetName] priests are notorious throughout the world for their sanguinary practices. They consider the many sacrifices that they regularly perform as an imperative necessity, a grim responsibility that every pious man must take part in to avoid the terrible wrath of the gods.\nYet, few can deny that the accomplishments of [From.GetTitledFirstName] in sating the gods' eternal thirst have towered upon those of all of [From.GetHerHis] colleagues.\nThrough [From.GetHerHis] faith and dedication, [From.GetSheHe] has cleansed the entirety of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a sea of blood, forging a sacred legacy that will not soon be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23457;As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [FromFrom.GetHerHim] for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] victory. Even though [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was not my offering, through [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, placating their ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23460;As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [From.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] victory. Even though [From.GetSheHe] was not my offering, through [From.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, placating their ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23470;By the construction of this sacred Ovoo Shrine, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and wild gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23751;I am concerned about the future of my dear [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName]. This realm requires a strong and healthy heir in order to prosper, and it is my duty as a responsible [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle] to take all possible precautions in order to ensure a smooth succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23752;A closer inspection of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s horoscope has revealed that my child was born under extremely auspicious stars and that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will likely grow to become a great leader once I have passed to the next world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23753;Inspecting the child's horoscope has revealed that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] will likely grow into a healthy and strong [FromFrom.GetManWoman], fully capable of ruling over my realm after I have moved to the next world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23754;Unfortunately, a closer inspection of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s horoscope has revealed that my child was born under ominous signs and that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] might be plagued by bad luck and waning health, dooming [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reign to be a short one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23755;Unfortunately, a closer inspection of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s horoscope has revealed that my child was born under ominous signs and that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] might be plagued by bad luck and waning health, dooming [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reign to be a short one, bereft with famine and strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23760;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] is the foundation upon which [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] rests. If any of us falter, the realm quakes. A weak link can break the chain of a great dynasty, and as such, I feel that I must deal with [scoped_improvement_target.GetFirstName]'s shortcomings if I wish to rest easy at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23761;All these days of mock-battles and constant drilling have finally paid off. Thanks to my relentless efforts, I have achieved a greater understanding of strategy than I ever thought possible. I can only hope that the new tactics I worked on will be able to protect the realm when war comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23762;I feel my temples pulsating under my fingertips as I sit down in the middle of the training grounds, holding my head and searching for a slice of peace after another day wasted yelling at my troops in a fruitless attempt to test a new tactic. I am trying my hardest to become a better commander, yet the results of all my work have been minimal and disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23763;My efforts to improve [From.GetFirstName]'s skills seems to have come at the unexpected price of my [GetFromRelation]'s looks. While less enlightened members of the court might berate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] lack of care, I cannot deny the sight of [From.GetHerHis] oily, tangled hair and furrowed brow has a familiar, scruffy charm to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23764;Ever since I had to abandon some of my more frivolous habits in order to focus on my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], my tangled hair and foul stench have been the topic of many slanderous chats going on at court behind my back. Luckily for me, [scoped_kindred.GetTitledFirstName] has risen to my defense on many occasions in support of my new lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23765;Still chewing on a tart, [From.GetFirstName] complains about how most people at court simply do not understand the costs of commitment to one's duty. [From.GetSheHeCap] then licks [From.GetHerHis] fingers clean and gives a bashful glance to the paunch straining [From.GetHerHis] dress, but I quickly reassure [From.GetHerHim] that I understand perfectly how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23766;I let out an annoyed grunt as the maid pushes harder against my back to tighten the laces of my dress, squeezing in my belly and thighs. "It is just a matter of sucking it in at the right moment," assures me [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] while cleaning the jam of [scoped_kindred.GetHerHis] last tart from [scoped_kindred.GetHerHis] fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23767;I have received some complaints by a few of [From.GetFirstName]'s friends. They claim that, because of my influence, my [GetFromRelation] is wasting away, so overwhelmed by [From.GetHerHis] new responsibilities that [From.GetSheHe] barely has time left to eat. Yet, personally, I see [From.GetHerHis] new lean look as a prized badge of [From.GetHerHis] unwavering dedication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23768;As [scoped_kindred.GetSheHe] passes me the next scroll, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] offhandedly comments that it is no wonder I am getting so much work done now that half of the men at court have stopped bothering me, mistaking me for a twiggy young boy. "Now, if only the priests would also leave me alone," I reply coyly, prompting us both to chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF23774;A small crowd has reunited around my palace, waiting for me to emerge as a grown [Root.GetManWoman]. The sound of chanting, cymbals and drums echoes all the way to my chambers while I prepare myself. The shamans warned me that this is a delicate and dangerous transition when the spirits roam closer to the world of the living, and that I should be careful not to anger the wrong ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF23008;[Root.GetHaruspexName] slits the goat's throat, then opens its belly and starts examining the entrails. The response is quite clear. The gods favor our cause in the war to come! The troops will fight with renewed strength now that they know for sure that our victory has been ordained from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Cancer, a constellation commonly associated with tenacity and introspection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23101;Centuries ago, the Galileans, in order to hide their crimes, falsely accused one of my predecessors of burning Rome to the ground. Perhaps it is time I returned them the favor and cleansed the Empire's old capital of the wretched temples scourging its Seven Hills...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23102;Living up the reputation of the heathen Emperors of old, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the ruthless destruction of the Holy See itself, in an attempt to undermine Christendom. After forcefully locking priests and cardinals within their own churches, [From.Culture.GetName] soldiers consigned the holy buildings to the flames.\nThis abominable act is certain to permanently cripple the authority of the Catholic Church for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23119;The higher standards of living that many of my subjects have had access to since the restoration of the Empire appear to have caused the anger of some Christian priests. A group of petitioners from the Church's clergy has pleaded me to put a stop to these new, luxurious customs, as they are detrimental to my people's salvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23212;Many raiders plague the coasts of the civilized realms, scraping by robbing traders and fishermen. Only a few are skilled enough to make a name for themselves and become notorious pirates, but even their stories pale in comparison to mine. \nMy palace is filled with the countless trophies I have gathered through a lifetime of endless plundering. I have laid waste of scores of towns, killed thousands, brought entire realms to their knees... \nThe land-dwellers scare children by telling stories about my exploits, talking of me as some sort of demon risen from the cold abyss of the ocean to drag their entire civilization towards a cold and terrifying end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23219;There must be some way to get into [From.GetName]. Our opponents are nothing but priests, and we have control over both land and sea. We have a distinct advantage over our enemies... If only I could think of a plan to get us past their walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23400;Despite having consulted with some of the world's most respected diviners and having analyzed sightings from several realms, I have yet to come to a conclusion regarding the future of our world. \nThe omens have been ambiguous and contradictory at every turn, and none of us has been able to give a clear interpretation of the message hidden in the heavens above. \nBeing the [Root.GetTitle], it is my duty to warn the notable [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers that misfortune might be imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23401;We are receiving scants reports from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] about infighting amongst our most illustrious diviners. \nIt appears that a series of ambiguous and contradictory sightings that have confused our priests as well as the [From.GetTitle] [From.GetHerselfHimself]. \nWith the heavens hiding our future, many amongst us are being beset by doubt and fearfulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23402;It is such a hot day in [Root.Capital.GetName]. I can barely breathe. I am discussing some menial theological issue with one of my clerics, when the [Root.GetManWoman] suddenly shrieks and jumps away from me. I look down, suddenly realizing that I am on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23403;The most disturbing news is spreading through the realm. Our revered [From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently spontaneously combusted during a theological debate. \nPeople are clamoring that this is surely a sign of divine wrath towards [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23404;After spending the last year scrutinizing the stars, looking for divine signs, I have come to the conclusion that a period of doom and misfortune is approaching our realm. I should inform my liege about my findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23405;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that, after a careful analysis of the celestial bodies, [From.GetSheHe] has come to the conclusion that our realm is unfavored by the stars and will soon enter a period of misfortune and bad luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23406;It is such a hot day in [Root.Capital.GetName]. I can barely breathe. I am discussing some menial issue with one of my courtiers, when the [Root.GetManWoman] suddenly shrieks and jumps away from me. I look down, suddenly realizing that I am on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23470;By carving our new Great Pillar, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and unyielding gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23760;Stability in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] can only be maintained as long as all the strands of the great tapestry which makes up this great realm of ours are weaved properly. I fear that [scoped_improvement_target.GetFirstName] has yet to reach the full extent of [scoped_improvement_target.GetHerHis] potential. [scoped_improvement_target.GetSheHeCap] might use some help to improve [scoped_improvement_target.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23761;All these days of harsh training and mock-duels have finally paid off. Thanks to my relentless efforts, I have become a better commander than I ever thought possible. When war comes to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I will be ready to lead my troops in battle and uphold the name of my dynasty without shame nor fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23762;I let out a loud swear and order my training partner to stop, faltering for a few steps before finally finding my balance again. The soldier asks if we should resume our training, but I simply dismiss him with a grunt while rubbing my sore wrist. I have been trying my best to refine my dueling skills in the past few days, yet I am still unsatisfied with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF23774;The little group of relatives and acquaintances awaits in the great hall, chanting and waiting for me to emerge as a grown [Root.GetManWoman].

EVTDESCDHF23400;After having consulted with some of the world's most respected diviners and having analyzed sightings from several realms, I have come to the conclusion that we are facing the beginning of a dreadful time. \nThe signs are clear: comets have flashed through the sky, misaligning the stars into unfavorable patterns, there have been accounts of two-headed children being born and other such prodigious omens, all pointing at a terrible future.\nBeing the [Root.GetTitle], it is my duty to inform all the notable [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers of this news, so that they may take all the necessary precautions to protect their subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF23402;I shudder in my sleep and let out a muffled scream, seeing the [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] staring at me from the other side of the room. Before I can even stand up or call for help, the creature leaps forward, pouncing on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF23403;The most disturbing news is spreading through the realm. Our revered [From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently died, eaten by a dragon in [From.GetHerHis] own palace. \nPeople are clamoring that this is surely a sign of divine wrath towards [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF23761;After countless nights spent awake in my study, reviewing reports and reordering the realm's archives and treasury, I have achieved a much greater understanding of the cogs that make this realm turn than I ever thought possible. With these new skills, I will surely be able to lead [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] into a new era of wealth and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF23762;I angrily crumple another paper and throw it away from me, looking sourly in the opposite direction. I have tried my best to improve my skills as a steward to rule more fairly  and competently over the good people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], yet all my efforts seem to result into nothing concrete. Whoever made our laws so needlessly complicated?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEHF23400;After having consulted with some of the world's most respected diviners and having analyzed sightings from several realms, I have come to the conclusion that the end times might be approaching. \nThe signs could not be clearer: long periods of sudden darkness have followed prodigious sightings of two-headed children and storms of fire. Rivers are drying up, crops are bleeding as clouds of blasphemous vermin encircle our lands, harbingers of our impending doom.\nBeing the [Root.GetTitle], it is my duty to inform all the notable [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers of this apocalyptic news, so that they may take all the necessary precautions to protect their subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23401;We have just received news from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. A most revered congregation of diviners under the leadership of our [From.GetTitle] have analyzed the stars and many prodigious heavenly sightings happening all over the world in the past months, and have reached the conclusion that a period of terrible misfortune is upon us.\nThe signs could not be clearer: long periods of sudden darkness have followed prodigious sightings of two-headed children and storms of fire. Rivers are drying up, crops are bleeding as clouds of blasphemous vermin encircle our lands, harbingers of our impending doom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23402;How could I not realize that the walls' edge was so close? At the very least, my shame will be very short-lived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23403;The most disturbing news is spreading through the realm. Our revered [From.GetTitledFirstName] has recently died after being caught by a strong wind that tossed [From.GetHerHim] into an abyss. \nPeople are clamoring that this is surely a sign of divine wrath towards [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23406;How could I not realize that the walls' edge was so close? At the very least, my shame will be very short-lived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23470;By consecrating an Hiisi Grove, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and mysterious gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23761;I have spent the last few nights extending my network of contacts and spies, hiring a veteran of the craft to teach me a few new tricks, and trying some of my own. As unpleasant as it was to take part in these dark proceedings, by refining my understanding of the human mind to a new level I will certainly be able to maintain peace throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHF23762;I dismiss the spy with an annoyed tap of my hand, returning to the solitude of my study. For a while I really thought I was making some progress, strengthening my network of spies and increasing my influence over [Root.Capital.GetName], yet mine was nothing but a fool's hope. At least half of my spies are turncoats working for my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Leo, a constellation commonly associated with fervor and pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHF23470;By carving this Great Totem, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing upon our tribes the protection of many benevolent spirits. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHF23761;I have lost track of how many books I have studied during the past few weeks. As of recently, I have been taken by a new craving for knowledge that I thought I had long satiated, and through it, I have acquired a much greater understanding of the world around us than I ever thought possible. These ancient wisdoms will surely help me in my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFHF23762;The sudden slam of my head against the open book brutally brings me back to my senses. I look around in the library, with a mix of confusion and embarrassment, hoping that nobody noticed me falling asleep over my work again. I have wasted entire nights trying to refine my scholarly skills, yet I feel no wiser than I was last month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCGHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Libra, a constellation commonly associated with fairness and moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHF23470;By carving this imposing Totem with the remains of our sacrifices, we have provided the gods with a great offering, buying us some reprieve from their terrible thirst for blood. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has taken a deep interest in helping me deepen my understanding of politics and foreign as of recently. I was skeptical at first, but, after countless hours spent reviewing old treaties and mingling with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s friends, I was amazed by how much I was able to learn in such a short amount of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHF23762;Dynastic names, family ties, political agreements, proper court manners... I hastily excuse myself from [From.GetTitledFirstName], my mind feverishly tormented by all the new information I am trying to assimilate. My [GetFromRelation]'s attempt to try and refine my diplomatic skills was well-intentioned, but it only made me more confused and upset about my limitations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF23001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was sacrificed to the cruel [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] gods! Accounts describe how [From.GetSheHe] was forcefully dragged screaming on top of a temple and torn apart by mad priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23002;The priests drag [From.GetTitledFirstName] screaming to the top of the temple, they place [From.GetHerHim] on an altar, and slice [From.GetHerHim] open with a ceremonial dagger.

EVTDESCHF23004;The [Root.Religion.GetName] religion does not forbid its practitioners to study other beliefs in their pursuit for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23008;The diviner's response was quite clear. The gods favor our cause in the war to come! The troops will fight with renewed strength now that they know for sure that our victory has been ordained from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23016;The [Root.Religion.GetName] faith allows free interpretation of the scriptures. I must decide which of the main branches of beliefs I ascribe to the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23017;Perhaps I misinterpreted the new scriptures. Perhaps there is a better way to worship the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23018;Followers of the [leader_of_dralhas.Religion.GetName] faith have always followed the central tenet of showing respect to all living creatures and to refrain from violence. But even the most peaceful of men must occasionally go to war.\n\nAs such, a new order has been founded, named the [leader_of_dralhas.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. They swear loyalty to all [leader_of_dralhas.Religion.GetName] rulers against those who would do them harm. A most devout [leader_of_dralhas.GetManWoman], named [leader_of_dralhas.GetFirstName], has pledged [leader_of_dralhas.GetHerselfHimself] to undertake the leadership of the order to preserve their way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23033;Now that I have embraced the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, I must choose which branch of it I ascribe to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23104;The citizens of Rome have not reacted well to the city's great fire. After boiling for a few days, a large mob of peasants has broken the peace and assaulted the local garrison, rebelling openly against the destruction of the Holy See and the collateral damage caused by the fire to the people's homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23113;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has clearly gone insane, yet, with the authority [From.GetSheHe] has accumulated after [From.GetHerHis] many accomplishments, [From.GetSheHe] might be able of perverting the Empire into a force for evil, a nation of idolaters. [From.GetSheHeCap] must be stopped now, before it's too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23114;To all the faithful of the One True God!\nThe [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] has taken over our [scoped_hellenic_emperor.GetTitle]'s mind, twisting it with lies and madness. We must stand together and depose the Apostate who sits on the holy throne of Rome or see the accursed heathens spread once again across our world.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23115;The time has come!\nAll the followers of the One True God suffering under the yoke of our mad [scoped_hellenic_emperor.GetTitle] have reunited under my lead and are ready to bring the blasphemous tyrant to justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23116;Several indignant vassals have banded together to stand against the new Imperial religion of Rome. They have taken arms and plan to overthrow their own [scoped_hellenic_emperor.GetTitle] and restore the worship of their god throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23117;Despite the incredible unpopularity of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] decision, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to emerge victorious from the Empire's recent civil war and reaffirm [FromFrom.GetHerHis] desire to restore the Hellenic faith to the Roman world. After [FromFrom.GetHerHis] show of force and lucidity, the Emperor has gained several new supporters, both amongst the people as well as the nobility. \n\nThis is truly a new beginning for Rome and a dark day for Christians everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23120;The newborn [leader_of_myrmidons.Religion.GetName] religion has found new protectors in the Myrmidons, a company of faithful warriors dedicated to the protection of the sacred altars of the old gods and the fight against the barbarous infidels besieging them.\n They swear loyalty to all [leader_of_myrmidons.Religion.GetName] rulers against those who would do them harm. A most devout [leader_of_myrmidons.GetManWoman], named [leader_of_myrmidons.GetFirstName], has pledged [leader_of_myrmidons.GetHerselfHimself] to undertake the leadership of the order to preserve their way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23122;Believed to be vanquished for centuries, the mad followers of Bacchus have resurfaced, spreading their grotesque beliefs throughout civilized lands.\nSlaves to their most primal desires, these deviants hide their twisted allegiance to the darkest powers of Chaos during daytime, walking inconspicuously amongst the virtuous. Yet, when night comes, they gather in the wilderness to dance around fires while dressed like goats and leopards, performing obscene orgiastic rites and consuming raw human flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to restore the ancient School of Stoicism. Based upon the pursuit of reason and moderation, Stoics believe in shunning all excesses and passions in favor of a balanced and rational approach to life, centered around the virtues of Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, and Justice.\nAlthough membership is not excluded to other religions, this philosophy has always been closely related to Hellenism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23124;A majority of the population in [From.GetName] has embraced the [Root.Culture.GetName] culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23125;A courier is brought before me with a message, telling me that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has imposed some strict social reforms on [From.GetName] to lead the populace into embracing [FromFrom.Culture.GetName] customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23200;Many gods inhabit the [Root.Religion.GetName] pantheon, but it would be only right to dedicate such an important temple as [scoped_temple_barony.GetName] to one of the twelve Olympians, the most prestigious of the deities watching us from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23201;[GetZeusJupiterName] is by many considered the King of Heaven. He and his brothers fought a war against their father for control of all Creation and then gambled over its spoils. Fate bestowed dominion of the skies upon [GetZeusJupiterName], leaving the seas to [GetPoseidonNeptuneName] and the earth to [GetHadesPlutoName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23202;[GetAresMarsName] has always been a very popular god amongst the Romans, observing a more direct and passionate approach to war compared to his sister [GetAthenaMinervaName]. While not explicitly a god of war, [GetHephaestusVulcanName] is often associated with blacksmiths, siege engines and weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23203;Several Hellenic gods are associated with earth and prosperity. [GetDemetraCeresName] oversees the harvest, [GetAphroditeVenusName] is associated with fertility, and [GetHestiaVestaName], one of the most beloved Roman goddesses, to hearth and family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23204;Apollo takes a very prestigious spot in Hellenic mythology, being associated with reason, arts and medicine. His twin sister [GetArtemisDianaName] on the other hand tends to have humbler, more secretive followers, being associated with night and nature. Finally, [GetHermesMercuryName] is the messenger of the gods, associated with roads, trading and, sometimes, trickery and theft. [GetPrincelyElectorsList];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23207;The pillaging of [From.GetName] has been very fruitful. Our warriors have gathered many prisoners amongst the populace that look fit to become good thralls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23208;The monstrous raiders led by [From.GetTitledFirstName] have slaughtered many of the people of [FromFrom.GetName], flooding the streets with blood in order to appease their wicked idols.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23209;[From.GetName] was filled with horses and cattle. Our raiders have rounded up a large flock in the main square so that I can decide which ones to pick for myself and what to do with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23210;My raiders have stormed the walls of [From.GetName] and overwhelmed the local garrison. With the defenders dead or forced to retreat, we have gained free access to the entire coast of this province. The many riches of [From.Location.County.GetName] are ours for the taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23211;The vile raider [From.GetTitledFirstName] has pillaged [FromFrom.GetName] to the ground. Many of his warriors, taken by greed and a bloodthirsty frenzy have destroyed several buildings and killed scores of people in their search for riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23213;There are many raiders plaguing our shores, but none have become as infamous as [From.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Common folks are afraid to even mention [From.GetHerHis] name, thinking of this [From.GetManWoman] as some sort of sea-demon, stalking the cold depths of seas and rivers, waiting to strike at unsuspecting preys. \nAccording to the stories, this ravager leads an army of drowned men and controls a giant wyrm. [From.GetSheHeCap] is said to have killed thousands and burned entire realms to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Pisces, a constellation commonly associated with introversion and compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHF23470;By carving this great monument, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and benevolent gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has spent a few weeks tutoring me on matters of war, hoping to share [From.GetHerHis] extensive tactical knowledge with me. [From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me learn how to drill my troops better and how to engage in complex mock-skirmishes to refine both the soldiers' and my own readiness. I could not believe that there was still so much to learn about strategy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHF23762;I feel my temples pulsating under my fingertips as I sit down in the middle of the training grounds, holding my head and searching for a slice of peace after another day wasted yelling at my troops. At first, I was excited when [From.GetTitledFirstName] offered me [From.GetHerHis] help to become a better commander, yet I simply cannot keep up with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIHF23025;After making the proper calculations, I have determined that I was born under the sign of the Sagittarius, a constellation commonly associated with dynamism and charisma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] has insisted that I spend some time with [From.GetHerHim], learning how to better defend myself. We trained and dueled for days, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the level of skill shown by my opponent. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was an exquisite training partner and a wonderful mentor. I am marveled at how much I have learned about combat in such a short time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHF23762;I let out a loud swear and ask [From.GetTitledFirstName] to stop, faltering for a few steps before finally finding my balance again. My [GetFromRelation] invites me to resume our training, but I simply shake my head. [From.GetHerHisCap] attempt to turn me into a better fighter by an intensive training was not as fruitful as either of us hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLHF23761;My [GetFromRelation] is of the opinion that I need to learn more about the responsibilities of a [Root.GetTitle]. [From.GetTitledFirstName] helped me to better understand some of the most commonly avoided duties associated with reviewing reports and administrating justice in the realm. Thanks to [From.GetHerHis] generous help, I have become a much more responsible ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLHF23762;I angrily crumple another paper and throw it away from me, trying to avoid [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s gaze. My [GetFromRelation] has been trying to teach me how to better organize and rule over my lands, but I have barely been able to follow half of the concepts [From.GetSheHe] keeps saddling my mind with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And yet, after a few weeks of intriguing discoveries, I must admit that my [GetFromRelation]'s help was not only appreciated but sorely needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHF23762;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been trying to help me refine my skills and extend my spy network for a few days now, hoping that doing so would help me better rule over [Root.Capital.GetName].

EVTDESCNHF23761;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been so courteous as to share some of [From.GetHerHis] most prized books and scarce time to help me refine my research method. I was amazed by the level of accuracy and care with which my [GetFromRelation] handled our collective studying sessions, and I have undoubtedly learned a lot by watching [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNHF23762;The sudden slam of my head against the open book brutally brings me back to my senses. I look around in the library, with a mix of confusion and embarrassment, and meet the disappointed gaze of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. My [GetFromRelation] was hoping to help refine my research method, but, unfortunately, I have proven to not be a student worthy of [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
