EVTDESC_JD_60302;After [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName] ordered that the borders be shut and trade along the Silk Road be halted, [From.GetTitledName] deemed that unacceptable and mobilized [From.GetHerHis] forces to open the Silk Road by force. The [From.Culture.GetName] troops managed to overcome and defeat the forces of [offmap_china.GetShortName] led by [offmap_china.Governor.GetTitledFirstName].\nThe Son of Heaven is most displeased with this loss and, under pressure by his advisors, has had no choice but to once more open up the Silk Road to traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_60304;After [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName] ordered that the borders be shut and trade along the Silk Road be halted, [From.GetTitledName] deemed that unacceptable. Using [From.GetHerHis] vast influence over the wealth of the Silk Road, [From.GetTitledFirstName], coerced the traders to return to their posts. This influx of traders into the formerly dormant trading posts was felt all the way back in [offmap_china.GetShortName] as they began transporting and selling their goods, much to the anger of the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress].\nWith no way of stopping this surge of trade the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has had no choice but to officially reopen the Silk Road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_60308;Once again the Silk Road has opened! Negotiations for this began between [offmap_china.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], and [From.GetTitledName]. The two managed to come to an agreement in that the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] would order the reopening of trade and all [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] asked was for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to [From.GetChineseForceOpenDemandChina].\nWhilst the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] may have preferred to stay in isolation, whispers from the East say that even [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] closest advisors are pleased with this peaceful outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
