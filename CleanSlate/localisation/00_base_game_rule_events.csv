EVTDESC_GR_1;As you hold no De Jure land within the [title_to_destroy.GetTier] of [title_to_destroy.GetName] you can no longer rightfully claim to be its ruler. You are now regarded as a mere claimant to a throne outside your reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_11;The tumultuous death of [From.GetFullName] presents an excellent opportunity for us to declare our independence. Of course, [nomadic_heir.GetFullName] might strike at us with vengeance for defying [nomadic_heir.GetHerHis] rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_12;My former subject, [From.GetFirstName], has chosen independence from my rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_19;§Y[text_target.GetBestName]§! has become independent from your realm as the land [text_target.GetSheHe] rules is too far from your capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_20;As the County of §Y[text_target.Capital.GetName]§! was too far from your capital, an uppity peasant named §Y[text_target.GetBestName]§! was able to seize the land unopposed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_21;As the Barony of §Y[text_target_barony.GetName]§! was too far from your capital, an uppity peasant named §Y[text_target.GetBestName]§! was able to seize it unopposed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GR_22;As your lands were too far from the capital of §Y[Root.TopLiege.GetBestName]§!, you have lost contact with [Root.TopLiege.GetHerHim] and become independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_GR_1;But [title_to_destroy.GetName] was to be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GR_11;No, we shall stay loyal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GR_12;I shall have their heads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
