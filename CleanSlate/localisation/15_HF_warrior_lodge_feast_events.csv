EVTDESCHF25200;Spirits are high at the Lodge tonight, and I am itching for a challenge. Many important warriors have gathered in the large hall to celebrate a recent hunt, giving me no shortage of capable warriors to test my strength with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25201;Many important warriors have gathered in the Lodge tonight in order to celebrate a recent hunt. I have barely joined some of my friends in the festivities when [From.GetTitledFirstName] barges in, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is twice as strong as I am and challenging me to an arm-wrestling match to prove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25202;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was too much of a coward to meet my challenge. [From.GetSheHeCap] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and left the hall in a hurry rather than test [From.GetHerHis] strength against mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25203;[From.GetFirstName] and I sit one in front of the other, preparing ourselves for the game. We put our arms on the table while a third fighter holds our fists still. The crowd around us chants a disjointed countdown, and cheers as we start pushing against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25206;For a while, it seemed as if victory was assured. I was slowly pushing [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. Yet, all of a sudden, [From.GetSheHe] has started to gain back ground, getting [From.GetHerHis] hand back up and starting to push on the opposite side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25212;Things are not looking great for [From.GetFirstName]. I am slowly managing to get [From.GetHerHis] knuckles on the table, despite [From.GetHerHis] best efforts to push my hand back. When [From.GetSheHe] suddenly shouts a semi-coherent warning about something dangerous behind me, I am baffled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25215;With a loud thud, I slam [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetFirstName]'s fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. My opponent glares at me and mumbles something about accepting defeat as [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetSheHe] rubs [wl_arm_wrestling_loser.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25216;With a loud thud, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] slams my fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. As if defeating me wasn't enough, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetSheHe] starts mocking me openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25217;With a loud thud, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] slams my fist against the table, earning a shower of cheers from the other warriors gathered around us. Luckily, [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetFirstName] decides to not rub in [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetHerHis] victory, and gives me a bit of praise for holding on this much against [wl_arm_wrestling_winner.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25226;A few of my fellow warriors have been spending the night at the Lodge, playing dice games while drinking. Noticing me watching them, they immediately invite me to join them. Initially, I refuse, but then they start teasing me, insinuating I am afraid of a simple betting game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25227;As I take the four-sided die inscribed with the intricate faces of the gods, I am asked how much I wish to bet before starting the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25228;As I take the four-sided die inscribed with the intricate faces of the gods, I wonder who should I put my faith in. Some combinations will reward me more than others, yet they are harder to come by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25229;Having set all the bets, the warriors gathered around the table incite me to throw the die, eager to see what face will come up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25230;My attempt to change the regular die with a weighted one did not pass unnoticed. After a bit of squabbling, one of the other fighters manages to pick the die away from me and throws it on the table a few times, revealing my intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25230_B;My attempt to change the regular die with a weighted one did not pass unnoticed. After a bit of squabbling, [random_society_winner.GetBestName] manages to pick the die away from me and throws it on the table a few times, revealing my intent and calling me a cheater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25231;Was there any doubt that [Root.GetWLDieBetName] would come up when I am using my lucky die? A chorus of cheers and groans accompany the result of the game and money is exchanged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25232;Unfortunately, I was too indiscreet with my leg, and several warriors noticed my attempt to move the die after it was cast. After a bit of squabbling, I am forced to accept defeat and pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25232_B;Unfortunately, I was too indiscreet with my leg, and several warriors noticed my attempt to move the die after it was cast. After a bit of squabbling, I am forced to accept defeat and recognize that [random_society_winner.GetBestName] has won the bet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25233;Despite the other warriors not noticing me kneeing the table, fate played me for a fool and I ended up accidentally pushing the die away from [Root.GetWLDieBetName], much to my disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25233_B;Despite the other warriors not noticing me kneeing the table, fate played me for a fool and I ended up accidentally pushing the die away from [Root.GetWLDieBetName], much to my disappointment. [random_society_winner.GetBestName] smiles triumphantly, crossing [random_society_winner.GetHerHis] arms and demanding me to pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25234;With just a little help, my die rolled exactly as I hoped it would, landing to show [Root.GetWLDieBetName]. A chorus of cheers and groans accompany the result of the game and money is exchanged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25235;A moment of silence falls upon our group as the die rolls from my hand and bounces a few times on the table, rolling to a halt to show the face of [Root.GetWLDieName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25235_B;A moment of silence falls upon our group as the die rolls from my hand and bounces a few times on the table, rolling to a halt to show the face of [Root.GetWLDieName]. As the realization catches [random_society_winner.GetHerHim], [random_society_winner.GetBestName] cheers triumphantly, immediately asking me for [random_society_winner.GetHerHis] money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25236;After the money from the first bets exchanges hands, I pick up the die and cast it again, trying to throw it exactly in the same way. The die rolls around the table and finally stops, showing the face of [Root.GetWLDieName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25236_B;After the money from the first bets exchanges hands, I pick up the die and cast it again, trying to throw it exactly in the same way. The die rolls around the table and finally stops, showing the face of [Root.GetWLDieName]. As the realization catches [random_society_winner.GetHerHim], [random_society_winner.GetBestName] cheers triumphantly, immediately asking me for [random_society_winner.GetHerHis] money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25236_C;After the money from the first bets exchanges hands, I pick up the die and cast it again, trying to throw it exactly in the same way. The die rolls around the table and finally stops, showing the face of [Root.GetWLDieName]. As the realization catches him, one of the other warriors cheers triumphantly, immediately asking me for his money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25237;I confidently throw my lucky die a second time and to the chagrin of all the other warriors, collect all bets a second time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25238;I let the die bounce on the table twice and, just as it is about to stop, I give a little nudge to the table, ensuring my victory a second time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25239;[From.GetBestName] and I spent last evening playing dice games with some of the other warriors in the main hall. Fortune did not smile to [From.GetFirstName], and by the end of the night, I had managed to empty [From.GetHerHis] purse quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25240;[From.GetBestName] and I spent last evening playing dice games with some of the other warriors in the main hall. Fortune did not smile to [From.GetFirstName], and by the end of the night, [From.GetSheHe] begged me to call in the favor I owned [From.GetHerHim], just to avoid paying all of the debt [From.GetSheHe] had accumulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25241;[From.GetBestName] and I spent last evening playing dice games with some of the other warriors in the main hall. Fortune did not smile to [From.GetFirstName], and by the end of the night, [From.GetSheHe] begged me to ask [From.GetHerHim] anything else rather than paying all of the debt [From.GetSheHe] had accumulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25250;Many warriors have gathered in the great hall tonight. The dinner has just started, and I already feel eager to test my mettle against one of them. It has been some time since we had a good Flyting, and there are plenty of candidates known for their crude manners and their sharp-tongue for me to choose from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25251;Right in the middle of a dinner, [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables. [From.GetSheHeCap] challenges me to a Flyting, encouraging me to stand up and prepare myself to be thoroughly humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25252;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to refuse my challenge. Muttering some poor excuse about not being in the mood for insulting anyone, the [From.GetManWoman] shrinks back in the crowd, amongst the derision of all the other warriors in the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25253;[From.GetTitledFirstName] takes a last drink and throws away [From.GetHerHis] tankard. [From.GetSheHeCap] stands up in front of me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is ready to turn me in the laughing stock of [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25254;I stand up and shout [From.GetFirstName]'s name in the dining hall, catching many warriors' attention, and challenge [From.GetHerHim] to a Flyting. Now I only need to decide what subject will cut deeper under [From.GetFirstName]'s skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25268;I lost my temper. Seeing that I was unable to rebuke [From.GetFirstName]'s insults, the crowd quickly sided with [From.GetHerHim] ensuring [From.GetHerHis] victory. As if it weren't enough, [From.GetFirstName] continued mocking me, even after I admitted defeat, reveling in shaming me for my loss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25269;I lost my temper. Seeing that I was unable to rebuke [From.GetFirstName]'s insults, the crowd quickly sided with [From.GetHerHim] ensuring [From.GetHerHis] victory. At the very least, after I admit defeat, [From.GetFirstName] calms me down and orders a drink for both of us, ensuring that it was all done in good fun and it was not [From.GetHerHis] intention to seriously offend me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25270;Perhaps I shouldn't have treated [From.GetFirstName] so poorly. Right after the game, [From.GetSheHe] swore revenge for [From.GetHerHis] humiliation and stormed off the main hall, amongst the laughter of all the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25271;Despite my show of kindness, [From.GetFirstName] refused to drink with me after the game. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] swore revenge for [From.GetHerHis] humiliation and stormed off the main hall, amongst the laughter of all the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25280;Our cellar has had a growing excess of mead for a few weeks now, to the point that I am starting to think about challenging the other warriors of the Lodge to see whom amongst them has the toughest stomach, while at the same time freeing some space and improving the fighters' morale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25281;[From.GetBestName] has decided to share a few barrels of mead to the entire congregation tonight, challenging [From.GetHerHis] fellow warriors to see which one among us will be able to drink the most without faltering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25283;Several recruits accepted my challenge at the mere mention of free mead and soon the main hall is filled with cheering and clashing of tankards. The servants bring in the first barrel while everybody finds a place in the long table, eager to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25284;Several recruits accepted my challenge at the mere mention of free mead and soon the main hall is filled with cheering and clashing of tankards. The servants bring in the first barrel while we all find a place in the long table, eager to start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25286;The first warriors have just started tapping out when a scuffle between two of the contenders quickly devolves into a large brawl. When the dust settles, there's barely anyone left standing, and most of the mead has been spilled on the floor, making it very hard for me to determine if there is any winner at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25287;The first warriors have just started tapping out when a scuffle between two of the contenders quickly devolves into a large brawl. When the dust settles, there's barely anyone left standing, and most of the mead has been spilled on the floor, making it very hard for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to determine if there is any winner at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25289;With most of the other warriors having tapped out, it looks like it is down to [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_1.GetFirstName] and [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetFirstName]. The two contenders are drinking face to face for some time, when I start noticing that [From.GetFirstName] has started to spill a suspicious amount of mead at each new round.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25290;When [From.GetFirstName] shouts my name, for a moment I think I have won the game. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all. [From.GetSheHeCap] has discovered my trick and called me out on it. Before I can try to explain myself, two warriors grab me by the arms and throw me out of the main hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25291;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. All of a sudden [FromFrom.GetFirstName] calls for the name of my opponent, there is a bit of a scuffle, and I am proclaimed winner. I am not exactly sure what happened, but I can hardly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25292;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. I gulp down another tankard and watch mindlessly as my last opponent falls head first on the table. While I am still processing what happened, I am proclaimed the winner of the contest amongst the cheers of the other warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25293;One by one, the contenders tap out, throw up, or pass out, leaving lesser and lesser warriors still drinking. At the end of the evening, there is only one left: [From.GetFirstName]. The crowd cheers a few times for the winner and carries [From.GetHerHim] around the hall for a while, giving [From.GetHerHim] some much needed praise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25294;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I am just about to raise my hand and drink another mouthful of mead when everything goes black. When I finally come back to my senses, one of the other warriors informs me that [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetBestName] was the one to win the contest in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25295;Despite my best efforts, [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetFirstName] is relentless, drinking tankard after tankard, leaving me well behind in the match. In the end, I am unable to even raise my arm to drink anymore, and lean on the table, conceding [WL_drinking_contest_winner.GetHerHim] victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25296;Once the other warriors have finally put me down and left me to cope with the more unpleasant consequences of my victory, [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself] approaches me to offer [From.GetHerHis] congratulations. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] was truly impressed by my resilience and would love to count a [Root.GetManWoman] like me amongst [From.GetHerHis] allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25297;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] was not interested in my offer. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] even understood what I was asking of [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] current state. But then again, perhaps it was a silly idea in the first place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25298;Once the other warriors have finally put me down and left me to cope with the more unpleasant consequences of my victory, [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself] approaches me to offer [From.GetHerHis] congratulations. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] was truly impressed by my resilience and would love to count a [From.GetManWoman] like me amongst [From.GetHerHis] friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25299;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] was not interested in my offer of friendship. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] even understood what I was asking of [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] current state. But then again, perhaps it was a silly idea in the first place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25300;Once the other warriors have finally put me down and left me to cope with the more unpleasant consequences of my victory, [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself] approaches me to offer [From.GetHerHis] congratulations. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] was truly impressed by my resilience and as a show of respect wishes me to have some of [From.GetHerHis] spoils from a recent raid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25205;Slowly but surely [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetFirstName] is gaining ground. Inch by inch, [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetSheHe] is pushing my fist closer and closer towards the table. I am starting to lose breath, my face is red and covered in sweat, yet I still cannot manage to push back against [arm_wrestling_fighter_2.GetHerHis] grip. I might simply not be strong enough to win this match...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25209;Slowly but surely, I manage to push [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. I grit my teeth and chuckle, glancing at my opponent to revel in my imminent victory. [From.GetFirstName] looks back at me with a smile. [From.GetSheHeCap] is leaning forward, trying to push back, and giving me a good view of her sweaty cleavage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25218;It has been some time now since I have begun noticing [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has distinguished [From.GetHerselfHimself] more than once amongst the members of our Lodge, to the point that I have started feeling strangely attracted to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25219;Tonight, just as I was about to leave the main hall, I was approached by [From.GetFirstName], one of my fellow warriors. After chatting for a while, [From.GetSheHe] reveals to me that [From.GetSheHe] has been watching me for a while, and finds me to be a very strong and attractive fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25220;I was right to trust my feelings. [From.GetFirstName] was surprised and happy to hear of how I felt about [From.GetHerHim] and told me that [From.GetSheHe] was merely waiting for the right opportunity to reveal [From.GetHerHis] own feelings for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25221;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] has spurned my advances without much thought to it. At first, I hoped that [From.GetSheHe] was simply misunderstanding my intentions, but, after a bit of discussing, [From.GetSheHe] flatly told me that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25222;It has been some time now since I have begun noticing [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has distinguished [From.GetHerselfHimself] more than once amongst the members of our Lodge. [From.GetSheHeCap] is, without a doubt, an impressive warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25223;Tonight, just as I was about to leave the main hall, I was approached by [From.GetFirstName], one of my fellow warriors. After chatting for a while, [From.GetSheHe] reveals to me that [From.GetSheHe] has been watching me for a while, and has come to consider me one of the most valuable members of the Lodge, as well as a terrific fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25224;[From.GetFirstName] was glad to hear of what I think of [From.GetHerHim]. We spent most of the night talking and ended up declaring our friendship to each other after a long series of toasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25225;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName]'s reception to my thoughts about [From.GetHerHim] was tepid at best. We talked for a while, but it soon became clear that we do not have as much in common as I initially thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25255;[Root.GetProwessInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25257;[Root.GetCharacterInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25261;[Root.GetFamilyInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25262;[Root.GetFamilyInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25263;We spar with words for a while, but soon [From.GetFirstName]'s face grows red with rage and embarrassment, surrounded by the laughter of the other warriors. Unable to put together a coherent response, my opponent has clearly lost the Flyting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25288;One by one, the other contenders either tap out or fall unconscious. I cannot see straight anymore and everything is blurry, but I am still standing. Unfortunately, so is [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetFirstName], and [warrior_lodge_drinking_finalist_2.GetSheHe] looks far more resilient than me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25205;Slowly but surely [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetFirstName] is gaining ground. Inch by inch, [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetSheHe] is pushing my fist closer and closer towards the table. I am starting to lose breath, my face is red and covered in sweat, yet I still cannot manage to push back against [arm_wrestling_fighter_1.GetHerHis] grip. I might simply not be strong enough to win this match...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25209;Slowly but surely, I manage to push [From.GetFirstName]'s hand closer and closer to the table. I grit my teeth and chuckle, glancing at my opponent to revel in my imminent victory. [From.GetFirstName] looks back at me with a smile and winks at me, making my heart skip a beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25255;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables, challenging me to a Flyting. [Root.GetProwessInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25257;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls my name from the other side of the dining hall, standing on one of the long tables, challenging me to a Flyting. [Root.GetCharacterInsultDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25200;I will pick the strongest I can find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25201;You are on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25202;Pathetic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25205;*Sneakily slide your elbow*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25206;Do not move your elbow, cheater!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25209;Not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25212;Do you think I am that stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25215;What sort of weakling are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25216;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25217;I need to train more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25218;I wonder if [From.GetSheHe] feels the same...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25219;And I happen to think the same about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25220;Interested in some late-night training?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25221;I should have known...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25222;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25223;Thanks. I feel the same about you, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25224;I couldn't ask for a better friend, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25225;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25226;Alright, then! Pass me the die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25227;All in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25228;I bet on Krita!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25228_HELLENIC;I bet on Apollo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25229;Luckily, I am using my weighted die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25230;It's not what it seems!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25231;Let's go again! Double or nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25232;I wasn't doing anything, I swear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25233;Stupid die...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25234;Let's go again! Double or nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25235;Yes! Let's go again, double or nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25236;Yes! Won again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25237;What a great night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25238;Come on, folks, pay up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25239;Already tired of playing, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25240;Perhaps you should not bet what you do not have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25241;I will think about this favor you owe me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25250;I will settle for nobody less than our best speaker!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25251;We shall see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25252;Pffh! What a coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25253;Go ahead, then! I will let you start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25254;[Root.GetProwessInsultOption];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25255;How dare you say that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25257;Shut up! Shut up immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25261;How dare you! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25262;How dare you! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25263;Stop being such a child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25268;This is it! From now on, we are enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25269;Well, too late for that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25270;Can the [From.GetManWoman] not take a joke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25280;Why not? Let the celebrations begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25281;I shall be the one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25283;Do not worry, there is more than enough for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25284;Come on! Start pouring already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25286;It was a fun evening at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25287;Ugh, well, at least it was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25288;There must be a way to get ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25289;Eh, I will allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25290;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25291;Yes! I *hic* won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25292;Yes! I *hic* won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25293;A determinate [From.GetManWoman] like [From.GetHerHim] is the kind of ally I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
