EVTDESC_SoA_5200;As you are leading your troops on campaign, one day a sergeant from your army rides up and asks to speak to you. He presents you with a small box containing a holy relic, and explains that it was found by a foraging party in the ashes of a nearby church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5201;One day at the market, a strange man comes up to you and offers to sell to you what he swears is a finger of Saint John the Baptist. You look at it carefully, and it does indeed seem to be a set of old human bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5202;A priest has arrived and asked for an audience. After being shown in, he explains that his small church can no longer protect the holy relic it holds, due to robbers plaguing the countryside. He therefore asks for your family to keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5203;That old relic that has been in your family's care... you realize you haven't seen it around it in a very long time. You look for it, but you can't find it anywhere. Why do these things always happen to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5204;Enemy raiders have attacked the small chapel where your family relic was kept. The priest tending the chapel tried to stop them but was slain on the doorstep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5205;Disaster, My [Root.GetLordLady]! Your court chaplain was attacked by a stray dog while he was carrying your family's relic shrine, and the holy bones fell out on the floor. And... well, the dog... we found it burying the bones in the yard among a lot of other bones stolen from the kitchens. Now it's impossible to sort out what is what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5206;Your court chaplain comes to you and suggests that the family relic could be used to help heal your pains. A night of prayers and the presence of this holy item might bring the Lord's attention to you and drive the sickness out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5207;As the farmers prepare for sowing their spring crops, your court chaplain suggests that you bring out the holy relic in procession and bless the fields. Surely, this would increase the likelihood of a bountiful harvest this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5208;Fingers of Saint John the Baptist, discount price for boxes of ten!\nA bishop brings to your attention that false relics are being sold at the market at great profits. They do of course generate a lot of commerce and taxes, but still, it's rather immoral and blasphemous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5209;A local friar has petitioned you to donate your family relic to the Church. After all, he says, it isn't right that one man should hold what belongs to all Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5210;That smooth and slightly malty taste, refreshing with just the right amount of bitter. Ah, these monks certainly know the art of brewing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5211;Such a wonderful bouquet. The complex blend of flavors spreads over my tongue just as the warmth spreads in my belly. These monks certainly know how to make a fine wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5212;Monks from a nearby monastery have arrived bringing healing herbs and offering to help treat your illness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5213;One day, passing by a monastery, you come upon a monk sitting and painting in a field. You observe his work and marvel at the composition, the colors and the fine brush strokes that bring the simple canvas to life. This monk is truly an artistic prodigy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5214;On a courtesy visit to the abbot of a local monastery, you observe a group of monks translating beautifully illustrated books into your language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5215;Monks from the nearby monastery have been stopping by to trade for supplies quite often lately. They usually linger to talk and exchange knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5218;During the last year or so, your [target_child.GetSonDaughter] [target_child.GetFirstName] has been spending a lot of time with the members of a local monastic order. You have also noticed that [target_child.GetSheHe] spends many hours per week in pious prayer. Then one day, [target_child.GetSheHe] approaches you asking for your permission to dedicate [target_child.GetHerHis] life to Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5219;The abbot of a nearby monastery has asked that you make a donation towards the repairs of the monastery church. Surely, it wouldn't hurt to ensure that you are in the monks' prayers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5229;You no longer follow the Christian faith. What should be done with your family's Christian relic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5240;As I woke up this morning my hands and feet were bleeding, and there is a sharp pain in my side. What is happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5241;Walking alone on the battlements late one night, you suddenly see a shining white shape appearing in the sky above you. It seems to be moving towards you, or maybe away. There's a strange sound in the air too, like a whispering... what is going on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5242;My belly is growing, and no one can doubt that I am with child. But my husband and I have not been intimate for a long time, how can I explain this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5243;My wife is with child, though she and I have not laid together for a very long time. She claims she has been blessed by our Lord just like the Virgin Mary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5244;You have been approached by an old priest who is offering you an exorcism. He claims he can free you of your demonic possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5301;There are things a Caliph should not do and should not be. But we are only human after all, and as long as people aren't aware of your vices and faults it's not a problem. However, it seems you've been slipping in discretion lately - gossip is starting to spread, and there are murmurings all over the Muslim world about your wicked habits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5302;A Fylkir of the Norse faith is expected to uphold certain standards of morality and strength. But we are only human after all, and as long as people aren't aware of your vices and faults it's not a problem. However, it seems you've been slipping in discretion lately - gossip is starting to spread, and there are murmurings all over the Norse world about your unworthy traits and habits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5307;You have received strange news from Rome. The former Pope, [From.GetTitledFirstName], did by his actions and lifestyle so defile the Holy See that the current authorities in Rome decided to put his corpse on trial!\nThe corpse of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgement. It was propped up on a throne, and a deacon was chosen to speak for it as its legal representative.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the accused was found guilty on all accounts and subjected to a punishment most dire. The corpse was stripped of its papal vestments, three fingers on the right hand (those used to give blessings) were cut off, and then it was interred in a graveyard normally reserved for foreigners of low status. The punishment still not being deemed severe enough, the corpse was then exhumed again, tied to weights and cast into the river Tiber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5312;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] leads a most wicked lifestyle, quite unsuitable for any priest and even more so for one in his exalted position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5314;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] leads a most wicked lifestyle, quite unsuitable for the spiritual head of all true Muslims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5316;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has a most worrying personality and lifestyle, quite unsuitable for any priest and even more so for one in his exalted position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5318;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has a most worrying personality and lifestyle, quite unsuitable for any priest and even more so for one in his exalted position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5320;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] leads a most immoral lifestyle, quite unsuitable for any priest and even more so for one in his exalted position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5322;Widespread rumors say that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has a most worrying personality and lifestyle, quite unsuitable for any priest and even more so for one in his exalted position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5341;You have received a visitor, a monk from the famous great abbey at Cluny. He tells you that the monks there spend much of their days in devoted prayer, and that they always mention the names of the most pious Christians in those prayers.\n\nIf you would demonstrate your immense piety by donating a large sum of gold to Cluny Abbey, you would surely be among those present in the monks' prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5342;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have received an invitation to visit the great monastery at Cluny!\n\nIt could make for a most interesting journey. Cluny Abbey has grown to great prominence and power since it was given independence by the Duke of Burgundy in 910. Subject now only to the Pope and supported by extensive lands as well as generous donations, it is a great center of wealth and learning. The Abbey's church is the largest in Europe, not even the great cathedrals in Rome or Constantinople can match it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5343;So this is the famous Cluny Abbey! The great church towers majestically over an extensive complex of buildings. The surrounding farmlands are rich and fertile, with peasants toiling to bring the fruits of the land into the coffers of the monastery. You can see many monks moving about and a also spot a nun or two. You can sense the atmosphere of learning, piety and power. This is a place that enjoys the direct support of kings and powerful nobles, not to mention the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5345;You have received a visitor, a monk from one of the monasteries on the fabled Mount Athos on the Chalkidiki peninsula in Greece. He tells you that the monks are constantly expanding their presence and constructing new monasteries at this most holy site. However, building for the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] requires earthly funds, he explains, and this is why he has come to see you.\n\nIf you would demonstrate your piety by donating a large sum of gold to the monasteries on Mount Athos, it would surely become known all over the land that you have done so, and you would of course also be mentioned in the monks' daily prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5346;My Lord, we have received an invitation to visit the holy monasteries on Mount Athos! The monks there are very protective of their domain, and it such an invitation is surely testament to your exalted status among men.\n\nIt is said that Mount Athos' status as a holy place began when it was first visited by the Virgin Mary, who loved it so that she asked her Son to make it her personal garden. And so it was, the mountain and the peninsula were consecrated as the Garden of the Mother of God. Because of this, all other women are forbidden to tread on its sacred ground. Monks, however, have been living here for hundreds of years, and more and more monasteries are constructed in the area as time goes by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5347;So this is Mount Athos! As you land on the shore in a small boat, you are escorted by a group of monks to a nearby monastery where you may spend the night. You are struck by the dramatic landscape and the variety of the ever growing number of monastery buildings. This is truly a strange and wondrous place!\n\nYou have a few days to spend here, and you hope to make the most of your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5353;My [Root.GetLordLady], there are strange tidings from the county of [home_of_jeanne_darc.GetName]. As our country suffers under the strain of war, a young woman has come forward and declared that the Lord has spoken to her and instructed her to deliver us from the enemies of our land. She wears armour, wields a sword and rides with the soldiers. Her name is [jeanne_darc.GetFullName] and she is said to be approaching your court at this very moment to offer her services to you as a leader in the war.\n\nSurely, it's an absurd notion that a young peasant woman should take the role of marshal or general of the [Root.GetTitle]'s armies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5355;My [Root.GetTitle], the lords of the Realm complain. They think it most unfitting and strange that a young maid of low birth is allowed such a prominent position when there are noble lords aplenty who are much more well prepared and competent to lead your armies. Some of them are asking if you are doing this deliberately to insult them.\n\nThere is also the issue of her claiming to be personally sent by God - it sounds rather heretical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5357;One evening at court, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] approaches you and asks to speak with you in private. You agree and the both of you sit down for a talk in your chambers. [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] speaks to you of her visions of Christ and her quest to save the country from the enemy. She speaks with passion, her simple honesty and forceful zeal both coming across as she looks you in the eyes. She declares her fierce loyalty and love for you as the chosen [Root.GetTitle]. You are quite impressed by her passion, intelligence and sincerity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5358;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] looks at you seriously. 'I hope you have been listening, my [Root.GetLordLady]. The country is hurting and you, its rightful sovereign, are the one to mend it. I shall aid you, this is the mission I have been given by our Lord Christ.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5359;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] looks at you with tears of joyous fervour in her eyes. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], you are the highest and also the wisest [Root.GetManWoman] in the realm. God shall guide you through me, and the people shall be saved. With the sword of righteousness in my hand, guided by your wisdom and the will of God, we will be victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5360;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] stands up, a shocked and bewildered expression or her face. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], your accusation wounds me most deeply! I have heard evil things said of me, but did not think I would hear it from you. Still, my loyalty to you comes from Christ and He is stronger than the Devil who has corrupted your faith. I shall always remain your servant, my [Root.GetLordLady]'.\n\nWith these last words, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] kneels before you, tears of sorrow streaming down her face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5361;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] quietly sits down next to you and looks into your eyes. As you embrace her and kiss her, she shudders and whispers: 'My Lord, see how my hands tremble at your touch. Just as I felt this immense joy mixed with bewilderment when Christ first spoke to me, so do I now feel my blood rushing in the same way in your presence. It seems to me that it is the will of God that we shall be together.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5362;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] recoils away from your advances, her eyes expressing surprise, sorrow and anger as she looks at you. 'My Lord, I did not think the devil would have sown such dark seeds in you as to try and impose on my chastity! I belong to Christ and to no man. Rest assured, my Lord - my loyalty to you is untouched, but so shall my body also remain, lest it be the touch of cold steel and martyrdom.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5364;The entire country is boiling with rumours and gossip of [jeanne_darc.GetFullName], the humble country girl who rose to become a trusted servant of the [Root.GetTitle]. Hope of defeating the realm's enemies is blossoming, and peasants everywhere are celebrating this fantastic tale of a virgin saviour from the humblest ranks of society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5366;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] has come before you asking to speak to you at the council. She says that the military establishment seems trapped in old doctrines and that the commanders would benefit from more offensive thinking, as well as more religious schooling, of course.\n\nThere is grumbling from some of the assembled nobles at her speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5368;Your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] approaches you one morning for a candid conversation: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], there is much displeasure among the clergy at the elevation of this young woman, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName]. The things she says are considered heretical by some in the Holy Church, and others, frankly, see their positions threatened by one of such low birth and meager schooling gaining so much prestige. I would advise you to consider whether it is worth protecting this young lass at so great a potential cost.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5370;These are unusual times. [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName]'s influence is felt all around, wherever you go. There is a surge in religiosity among the commoners, who see her as a national saviour and almost a Christ-figure. Among the nobles many are charmed by her pious innocence and energetic zeal, in spite of most of them also viewing her as a dangerous upstart. Meanwhile, the clergy is divided, some seeing a heretic and others a saint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5373;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName] comes to see you, a look of worry on [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] face. [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] explains that there are increased grumblings among the nobles regarding the position of your protegé [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName]. Many of them refuse to accept that a lowborn woman from [home_of_jeanne_darc.GetName], however competent and pious, be continuously given so many privileges normally reserved for nobility. It sets a bad example for the peasants and may cause unrest, they fear. There have also been numerous incidents of perceived insults and scandals of protocol between [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] and various prestigious army commanders.\n\nIt seems many nobles feel they have suffered her too long, and some still entertain the idea of demanding her arrest and trial for heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5382;Never has the realm seen so much attention focused on the wedding of one who is not of noble birth. The wedding of [From.GetFirstName] has caused ringing of churchbells and impromptu feasts and prayers among the common folk all around the country.\n\nNo longer a maid perhaps, but an icon of the realm still, and even the [Root.GetTitle] should make sure to make a public toast to the newly-weds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5385;[From.Mother.GetFirstName] the Maid she used to be, but no longer. Some of her followers speak of a virgin birth, though such talk is frowned upon by the Church. The image of [From.Mother.GetFirstName] has now changed in the eyes of many, but she continues to be a focus of adulation, and very soon after the birth she has once again taken up her sword and saddled her horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5391;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] has been put on trial for heresy. She claims to be sent by Christ, to be his messenger. She is accused of being sent by the devil, and of claiming to be God's daughter, and of sinning by wearing men's attire, among other things. The judges come mostly from the clergy, and they begin a hard line of questioning against the young woman. There is unrest outside the castle where the trial is held, as many followers have come to pray for her and express their belief in her innocence. This trial seems set to last for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5392;[jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] has been put through long sessions of questioning for over a month now. After much deliberation on the law and theology and evaluation of testimony the case still seems unclear to many. It all seems to come down to whether you want to believe that she is a messenger of God or of the Devil. Or perhaps it's more down to whether it is politically expedient to convict her or not. Young [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] herself has assumed a position of sorrowful fatalism. She says she has seen her fate in a vision and that she knows what is to come.\nThe crowds surrounding the trial all await the verdict with tension. If [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] were to be aquitted, the humiliation of the trial itself surely signifies that she has fallen from royal grace and will never come back to hold the position she once did. But in the case of a conviction, a gruesome death by burning at the stake is certain to be the fate that awaits her. There is little mercy for heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5394;The flames leap higher and higher, crackling as they begin to eat at the wood. Slowly, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] starts to twist as they begin to lick her legs. The gathered crowd stares in stunned silence - some hungry for her death, others overcome by horror at what they see. The life of this woman is coming to an end, she who captured the attention of the entire realm during these months. Saint or devil – the eyes of the onlookers hold different views, but it seems certain that she will remembered for many many years. Perhaps she shall have her restitution in time, perhaps not.\nAs the flames climb higher and take hold of [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName]'s body, she twitches violently but still does not cry out. Her gaze is fixed on the heavens, tears streaming from her face. Many onlookers turn away now, but others are fixed to the spot, unable to avert their eyes. Slowly, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] disappears from view as the flames rise around her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5395;The aquittal of [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] have left mixed reactions across the realm. There are celebrations among the peasants, and more mixed reactions among the nobility and clergy. [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName] herself spends these days in prayer. She realizes that she will not lead armies again nor enjoy the ear of the [Root.GetTitle] as before. Still, the aquittal at the trial has vindicated her words and actions and she seems at peace. No longer on the grand stage of war and politics, she seems now content to spend the rest of her days living as a nun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5398;After the first turbulent years, it seems everyone in the country has gotten used to [jeanne_darc.GetFullName]. Some appreciate her and some do not, but the more violent controversy and commotion has died out and people are now preoccupied with other matters. She lives on, although the tales of the early years of the Maid of [home_of_jeanne_darc.GetName] are already the stuff of legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5400;My [Root.GetLordLady], the heretic city of [From.GetName] has surrendered to us. We could punish the heretics by sacking the place, but it has been put forth by some that the city's populace are of mixed faith and it is unlikely that the soldiers will know who is a heretic and who is not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5401;A combination of economic stress and religious fervor caused by the current crusade has led to considerable unrest among the peasants. A strange elderly monk known calling himself The Master of Hungary has been criticizing the religious establishment and preaching a 'Shepherds' Crusade' to the common folk. He has already been able to gather a huge following, an army of shepherds as it were, and they have been assaulting priests and killing Jews all over the country. Needless to say, the church is not amused. There is now talk among this rabble of marching on the capital to seek the support of the [Root.GetTitle] - who knows where this will end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5403;The Shepherds' Crusade has been plaguing the country for many months now, causing much terror and woe. Lately, however, it seems to have been slowly losing its initial strength and zeal. According to some reports now, the whole movement is dissolving as people are returning to their homes and abandoning the whole adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5409;[From.GetTitledName] has been seized and killed by members of the Shepherds' Crusade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5410;It seems that my interest in Christendom has come to the attention of one of its practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5411;It seems that my interest in Islam has come to the attention of one of its practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5412;It seems that my interest in Paganism has come to the attention of one of its practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5413;It seems that my interest in Zoroastrianism has come to the attention of one of its practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5414;It seems that my interest in Judaism has come to the attention of one of its practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5420;How I hate the infidels! Smash them, kill the scum, kick them in the teeth, wipe them off the face of the earth! Bastard infidels, aaah how I hate them, I hate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5422;My new faith gives me strength, but I will not forget where I came from or disrespect those who still follow the old ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5423;My new faith infuses me with strength. But it vexes me that there are still those who do not follow the way of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5425;We Muslims believe in God, and in that which has been bestowed from on high upon us and upon Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants, and that which has been vouchsafed to Moses and Jesus and all the prophets by their Sustainer - we make no distinction between any of them, and it is unto Him that we surrender ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SoA_5243;I am blessed also, like Joseph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5244;The demons must come out, at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5301;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5302;May the Gods still judge me favorably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5307;I am sure the judges have acted wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5312;We must pray for his eternal soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5314;Like this, he will lose Allah's blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5316;The Gods will not be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5318;Tengri's wrath will be upon him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5320;Judgement comes to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5322;Perhaps it is time to sacrifice him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5341;They shall have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5342;A wonderful opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5343;I must study the magnificent architecture here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5345;Of course they shall have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5346;I must go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5347;I must see all the monasteries, the architecture here is fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5353;Let us receive her and see what she can do for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5355;Let them moan. I am the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5357;Thank you for coming to see me, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5358;Very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5359;So it shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5360;Stop this ridiculous charade, woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5361;Come to my bedchamber then, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5364;She is truly a legend in her own time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5366;Thank you, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName], that's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5368;Please remind these clergymen who is [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5370;We should all try to be more like her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5373;Bah! Their own incompetence makes them envious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5382;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5385;So strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5391;The truth shall be our only concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5392;She is guilty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5394;May the Lord have mercy on her soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5395;You are safe now, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5398;With time, anything and everything becomes normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5400;Kill them all! God will know his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5401;We will appease them with gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5403;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5409;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5410;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5411;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5412;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5413;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5414;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5420;Oh, did I say that out loud?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5422;They will see the truth eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5423;Infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5425;We must not condemn the Jews and Christians for their errors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SoA_5200;I will give it to the local church back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5201;This can be anyone's finger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5205;Just put any old bones in there, no one will know the difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5206;Bring a healer but keep those old bones away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5207;No, I don't think it would do any good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5208;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5209;I will prepare a grand ceremony to hand it over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5210;Thanks but no thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5211;Thanks but no thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5212;I think not - these herbs smell funny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5213;Very nice, now let's eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5214;Pretty pictures, but I have more important things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5215;How tedious, these men of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5218;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5219;Sorry, I can't spare the gold right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5229;Sell it to the Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5240;This is disturbing. I had better go see a healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5241;Strange how clouds and wind can play tricks on one's mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5242;No miracle. But maybe my husband will believe that it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5243;I shall pretend that I believe this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5244;No! We shall be together forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5341;I'm sure they'll manage anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5342;Tell them I can't come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5343;May I see the library?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5345;I can't spare the funds right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5346;Tell the monks I cannot come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5347;I will spend my days conversing with these wise monks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5355;I agree, but this woman is popular among the common folk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5357;My dearest [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName], you are truly sent by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5366;When I need your advice, I'll ask for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5368;She is merely a tool, the Church has nothing to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5370;I dislike fanatics, but I will suffer her for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5373;I shall force her to speak more humbly henceforth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5392;She is innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5400;We must show restraint. Hold off the soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5401;We should try to recruit them for our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SoA_5205;Hang on, let me see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5208;Get in on the business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5209;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5229;Throw it to the dogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5243;Now wait a minute...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5244;Maybe some time of rest and introspection would serve me better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5343;These monks obviously eat well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5347;I have come here to pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5355;Very well, we shall put her on trial for heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5357;We both know you are a powerhungry impostor, [jeanne_darc.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5366;I've had enough of this insolence – arrest her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5368;Very well, we will put her on trial and see if she is a heretic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5373;Not noble enough? Bring her before me and I shall knight her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5401;These criminals must hang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_SoA_5343;I have come here to pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SoA_5357;Love, you say? Come sit over here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SoA_5373;I cannot abide this any longer. Put her in chains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPA_SOA_5218;[target_child.GetFirstName] is very happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOA_5218;[target_child.GetFirstName] is very upset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
