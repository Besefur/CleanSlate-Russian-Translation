EVTDESC_MNM_9100;During the last few days, I have overheard the same conversation again and again. Apparently, a most renowned goldsmith is traveling through [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and my courtiers are prattling excitedly about [smith.GetHerHis] work. Perhaps I should invite this [smith.GetManWoman] and employ [smith.GetHerHis] services?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9103;The goldsmith, [smith.GetTitledFirstName], courteously accepted my invitation and arrived at court a mere week later. [smith.GetSheHeCap] has presented me with some sketches of [smith.GetHerHis] previous work and several letters of recommendation. I am assured of [smith.GetHerHis] skill, although I ask myself just how much money I can spare for a set of crown jewels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9105;I was overcome by excitement and curiosity when [smith.GetFirstName] informed me the crown jewels were completed! As I am waiting in my throne for [smith.GetHerHis] servants to carry the great box across the room I struggle not to leap up and meet them half-way. When I finally touch the heavy lid, my hands are shaking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9106;[smith.GetFirstName] has kept me up to date on the progress of the crown jewelry. I knew they were nearing completion, but when the heavy box was brought to me today, I was still momentarily breathless with excitement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9107;A heavy box has been brought before me. [smith.GetFirstName] has finished [smith.GetHerHis] work and the crown jewels are completed. While I expect no artifact of legends, I am still excited to see [smith.GetHerHis] handiwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9107_GENERIC;A heavy box has been brought before me. [smith.GetFirstName] has finished [smith.GetHerHis] work and the crown jewels are completed. I expect something properly befitting my title as [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I am excited to see [smith.GetHerHis] handiwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9107_KING;A heavy box has been brought before me. [smith.GetFirstName] has finished [smith.GetHerHis] work and the crown jewels are completed. I am excited to see what the handiwork of [smith.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9109_NEW;'Good news, my [Root.GetTitle],' [smith.GetFirstName] said excitedly. The goldsmith has informed me that precious metals and gemstones have been located in a nearby province. If we send an expedition, it could increase the quality of the crown jewels we are currently crafting. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9112;The smith I hired has unfortunately died before finishing my order. It won't be easy to find another smith of similar skill... Luckily it seems not all the money I paid had yet been spent, and so I was able to recover a sizeable portion of my investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9115;My [Root.job_marshal.GetJobTitle] [Root.job_marshal.GetDynName] has told me about a remarkable [GetWeaponArmorSmith] residing in [neighbor_province.GetName]. [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHeCap] suggested that I invite the [smith.GetManWoman] to my court to see [smith.GetHerHis] work for myself. If [smith.GetSheHe] manages to impress me, I could order my own custom made item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9115_b;The word around the court is that a remarkable [GetWeaponArmorSmith] is residing in [neighbor_province.GetName]. Perhaps I should invite the [smith.GetManWoman] to my court to see [smith.GetHerHis] work for myself. If [smith.GetSheHe] manages to impress me, I could order my own custom made item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9118;Once the [GetWeaponArmorSmith]'s craftsmanship had been checked by my most knowledgeable attendants to ensure the quality was sufficient, I received [smith.GetHerHim] in the throne room. [smith.GetSheHeCap] introduced [smith.GetHerselfHimself] as '[smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]' and gestured towards [smith.GetHerHis] numerous assistants, who all carried examples of [smith.GetHerHis] work. 'Does my [Root.GetTitle] have anything special in mind?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9120_NEW;'A [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon]. I see. An excellent choice, my [Root.GetTitle]' says [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] and calls forward an assistant cradling several [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon]s in [smith.GetHerHis] arms. 'I have a couple of examples here. One must determine what one need and how much one is willing to pay, though they would all serve your Highness well.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9122;I was struck with nervous excitement when [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] announced that the [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] was nearing its completion. Today I have received the [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] in my throne room. A sturdy box is in [smith.GetHerHis] arms, and as [smith.GetSheHe] opens the lid, I find it almost impossible to breathe. 'What will you name her, my [Root.GetTitle]?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9122_B;I was struck with nervous excitement when [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] announced that the [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] was nearing its completion. Today I have received the [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] in my throne room. As [smith.GetSheHe] unveils the armor rack, I find it almost impossible to breathe. 'What will you name her, my [Root.GetTitle]?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9123;Finally, the [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] has been completed! [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] has brought me a sturdy box which contains the item. My hands are shaking slightly as I open its heavy lid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9124;[smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]'s main assistant has brought me the finished [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon]. There are no engravings or precious materials to enhance it, but the design has some elegance of its own. Looking pretty is not her main purpose, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9124_GENERIC;[smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]'s main assistant has finally brought me the finished [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] I have been waiting for. It is a beautiful and elegant [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon], and I am excited to see it goes beyond my original expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9124_KING;[smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]'s main assistant has brought me the finished [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon]. It is an elegant though simple design, and it looks like a fine quality weapon I can bring to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9129_NEW;'Good news, my [Root.GetTitle],' [smith.GetFirstName] said excitedly. The [GetWeaponArmorSmith] has informed me that precious metals and special tools have been located in a nearby province. If we send an expedition, it could increase the quality of the [smith.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] we are currently crafting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9130;What type of smith do you wish to send word for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9132;It has been many weeks since I commissioned [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] to work for me and today my council has informed me that [smith.GetFirstName] has fled from my lands to the court of [smith.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]! Taking the work promised to me and any gold left with [smith.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9135;As I was walking towards [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]'s smithy I could not hear the sound of progress but instead the sound of voices talking. I found [smith.GetFirstName] and my [smith_event_target.GetRootRelation] [smith_event_target.GetTitledFirstName] discussing different metals and their compositions. All this talk was making my head spin and definitely halting the progress on the work I have ordered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9136;During the afternoon as I went to check on the progress of [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] I walked in to see [smith.GetHerHim] getting my [smith_event_target.GetRootRelation] [smith_event_target.GetTitledFirstName] to help with the forging process. Together they were lifting pieces of metal and [smith.GetFirstName] was showing [smith_event_target.GetFirstName] how to mold the materials into shape. Not exactly what I am paying [smith.GetHerHim] for but a form of service nonetheless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9137;Having decided to check up on [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName]'s progress I strolled over to [smith.GetHerHis] forge. I did not find [smith.GetHerHim] working on the project I commissioned but instead working on a different task... specifically my [smith_event_target.GetRootRelation] [smith_event_target.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9138;I was taking a relaxing walk this morning when suddenly I heard a scream pierce through the air! I rushed to the source and saw that it was [smith.GetMasterMistressCap] [smith.GetFirstName] wailing in [smith.GetHerHis] forge. From what I could gather, between the servants chatter and [smith.GetFirstName]'s crying, there was an accident involving some molten metal! It is lucky that [smith.GetFirstName] is alive. Yet this will definitely impede [smith.GetHerHis] work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9999;The castle blacksmith, more used to horseshoes and helmets than work fit for royalty, presented you with a dirty old box. "Ta da" he says, nervously, "It was a sword you wanted right?" he adds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
