EVTDESC_REP_101;[feuding_patrician.GetTitledName] will soon be hosting a great ball in [feuding_patrician.GetHerHis] family palace, and every patrician family in the republic has been invited - except for yours. Your dynasty's relation with the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has been tense as of late, as you are competing with them in several important markets.\n\nThe decision not to invite [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] members to the ball can only be seen as a grave insult. As you sit brooding in the chambers of your own palace, you wonder how to tackle this situation. Will you turn up at the ball anyway, pretending there has been some mistake, or will you turn the other cheek and accept this affront to [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_102;You show up at the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family palace with your entourage, and make your way past the posted guards before they can block your way. Music and laughter can be heard from inside the palace, but it seems to die out the moment you step inside. Hushed whispers are all that can be heard as everyone's eyes seem to focus on you.\n\n"[Root.GetTitledFirstName]!" someone calls out. [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] emerges from the crowd with a smile on his face. "How kind of you to join us. May I see your invitation?" As you struggle for words, guards surround you and your party. "No invitation? That's a shame." With a small wave from [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName], the guards drag you all outside and throw you down the stairs of the entrance. Lying on your back in the dirt, you see [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] grinning down at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_104;As a way to get back at the vile [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, you could make arrangements to host your own grand ball. Invitations will be sent out to all patrician families, with the exception of the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] of course.\n\nIf this is to work, your ball will have to be much grander than the one that weasel [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] threw together. It won't be cheap, but it would restore your prestige and bring shame to those [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] dogs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_105;The day of your grand ball has arrived and everyone of importance in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] is in your palace. Everyone but the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Your guards have strict orders not to permit anyone from their bloodline inside.\n\nIn one corner of the ballroom, a bearded gentleman who looks vaguely familiar is loudly and unfavorably comparing your ball with the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] one. As you approach him to set him straight, you recognize something in his voice... could it be possible...? You rush forward and rip the thick beard from the man's face to reveal [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName]! "YOU!"\n\nAstonished, [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] pushes you aside and makes a mad dash for the exit like a frightened rabbit while shoving several dancing guests to the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_151;Word has reached you that your mortal enemies, the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, are planning the construction of a great galley the likes of which has never before been seen. It is to surpass even the bucentaur, the flagship of the Venetian Doge, in size and splendor. The hubris of [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] is without equal!\n\n[Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName], your [Root.GetSpymasterName], has put together a plan to make sure this atrocity never sails the seas. Men loyal to [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHim] will infiltrate the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipyard in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] posing as shipwrights. Once inside, they will add several subtle structural flaws to the galley that will hopefully escape detection until it sets out on its maiden voyage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_152;[feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to unveil the new [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship today, at the annual Marriage of the Sea ceremony where the maritime dominance of Venice is celebrated. [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] has invited [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] himself to oversee the ceremony from the great ship. As a long procession of ships sail through the city canals, the Pope drops one of his rings into the water and proclaims, "We wed thee, sea, in the sign of..." \n\nBefore he can finish the sentance, the galley lurches and begins to tip over! Both the Pope and [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] are thrown overboard, but they are soon fished out of the water by some nearby gondoliers. The Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church wrings out his drenched robes while launching a long tirade of profanity directed at [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName], who has turned red with embarassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_153;The [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship has been completed, and nobles from all over [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] have gathered at the docks to watch as the mighty vessel is put to sea. [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] is beaming with arrogant pride, especially when he spots you in the crowd. Before long, the sleek vessel slides into the water and hoists its sails who are adorned with the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family crest.\n\nSuddenly the great galley snaps in half with a terrible crack! The crowd gasps in stunned silence, but [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] turns to face you immediately, his eyes glowing with fury. "YOU! This was YOUR doing!" he screams as spittle sails from his mouth. With a howl he attempts to hurl himself at you, but his struggling aides hold him back. "I don't know how you did it, [Root.GetFirstName], but I swear you will pay for this! Do you hear me, [Root.GetFirstName]?! YOU WILL PAY!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_154;You are sitting on the deck of a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley, enjoying the cool sea air and the smell of saltwater when a large shadow suddenly blocks out the sun. A colossal galley, easily twice the size of your ship, sweeps past dangerously close and sends a large wave sweeping over the deck that knocks you off your feet. It's the new [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship!\n\nAs you stand up, drenched from top to bottom, you hear cackling laughter from the deck of the other ship. [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] stands by the railing looking down at you with a smug grin on his face. "Well, well, if it isn't [Root.GetTitledFirstName]! How are you doing down there? You should take better care when sailing in waters trafficked by larger vessels. I would hate for an accident to occur..." You turn away from him to hide your scowl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_155;Yet another public execution has been scheduled in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], and your attendance is required. Though these events normally bore you, this one catches your full attention when you realize that the convicted men about to be executed are the same men [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] sent to infiltrate the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipyard. [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] joins the executioner and the convicts on their platform, and looks at you with a gloating smile.\n\n"My friends, take a long, hard look at these men," [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] begins. "They are enemies of the Republic and together they conspired to sabotage the construction of the new [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship. Fortunately, they were caught in the act and it has been revealed that they were not acting alone..." He gives you a long glance and you think you realize where this is going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_161;You wake in the middle of the night after a restless sleep, and decide to go for a stroll through the empty corridors of your palace. For some reason, you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss. Glancing through a window, you suddenly spot your laughing daughter on her balcony being serenaded by a secret lover below!\n\nTo your horror, you recognize the man as [romeo.GetTitledFirstName] of the despicable [romeo.GetOnlyDynastyName] family! You immediately grab the nearest crossbow and send several bolts after [romeo.GetFirstName] while screaming obscenities at him. The vile lecher quickly retreats and disappears into some bushes, while you hurry towards your crying daughter's room to scold her for bringing such shame to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_163;You wake in the middle of the night after a restless sleep, and decide to go for a stroll through the empty corridors of your palace. For some reason, you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss. As you pass your son's room, you hear faint girlish laughter and other sounds of a carnal nature! You kick open the door to reveal your son in bed with a secret lover!\n\nTo your horror, you recognize the girl as [julia.GetTitledFirstName] of the despicable [julia.GetOnlyDynastyName] family! As you furiously scold your son for bringing such shame to the family, the girl leaps out of bed wearing only the bedsheets and runs away in tears. The sound of her bawling echoes throughout the palace corridors, and it is matched in volume only by your voice as you discipline your son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_164;You are eating supper when the doors to your palace's dining room suddenly fly open and [romeo.Father.GetTitledFirstName] storms inside, chased by your guards. "Where is he?" [romeo.Father.GetFirstName] demands, pounding his fist on the table. "Damn it, [Root.GetFirstName]! Where is my son?!" He slams a piece of paper on the table. "I expressly forbade him from having anything to do with that harlot daughter of yours, but today I found this note!"\n\nHe reads with a somber voice: "'Father, since you would deny me the love of my life and since...' etc, etc, '...my love and I have decided to end it all. Farewell.'" With a gasp, you push the table aside and rush up the stairs towards your daughter's room with [romeo.Father.GetFirstName] on your heels. There, embracing each other on the floor, the two lovers lie dead next to an empty bottle of poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_165;You are eating supper when the doors to your palace's dining room suddenly fly open and [julia.Father.GetTitledFirstName] storms inside, chased by your guards. "Where is she?" [julia.Father.GetFirstName] demands, pounding his fist on the table. "Damn it, [Root.GetFirstName]! Where is my daughter?!" He slams a piece of paper on the table. "I expressly forbade her from having anything to do with that no-good son of yours, but today I found this note!"\n\nHe reads with a somber voice: "'Father, since you would deny me the love of my life and since...' etc, etc, '...my love and I have decided to end it all. Farewell.'" With a gasp, you push the table aside and rush up the stairs towards your son's room with [julia.Father.GetFirstName] on your heels. There, embracing each other on the floor, the two lovers lie dead next to an empty bottle of poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_166;It is a day of joyous celebration! Despite the bitter rivalry between the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [rival_kid.GetOnlyDynastyName] families, love found a way to bridge that gap and bring a young couple together. You decided not to intervene, and it seems [rival_kid.Father.GetTitledFirstName] shared your sentiments and gave his blessings to the couple. Today they are joined in the sacred union of marriage.\n\nThis will hopefully be the start of a lasting peace between your families, and a new era of friendship. As the ceremony is completed and the festivities commence, you and [rival_kid.Father.GetFirstName] shake hands and share some wine together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_168;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and the [rival_kid.GetOnlyDynastyName] families have come together on this day to mourn the recent loss of their two children. Yet amidst all the gloom there is a glimmer of hope for the future. You and [rival_kid.GetTitledFirstName] are meeting with all the ranking members of your two respective houses.\n\nTogether you have decided to finally end the bitter feud that has been raging longer than anyone can remember. It may be too late for your closest kin, but future generations of [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [rival_kid.GetOnlyDynastyName] children will no longer grow up seeing each other as mortal enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_182;You have long suspected that the dastardly [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family are smuggling illegal goods into [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], but now you have finally managed to confirm it through your sources. You have no proof, of course - [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] is too clever for that. As you contemplate your options in your study, your son [ambushing_son.GetFirstName] enters and presents a plan.\n\nHe has learned that a [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] smuggler is due to arrive in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] tomorrow night with a full hold. Together with some trusted men, he will lie in wait and seize the cargo as soon as the ship moors at the dock. The [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] smugglers won't know what hit them, and even if [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] learns the truth, he won't be able to act against you without revealing the smuggling activities of his house. You could profit greatly by selling the smuggled goods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_185;As night falls over the docks of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], the smugglers quietly slip into port with their galley. They leave their lanterns unlit and skillfully rely on the moonlight to guide them in.\n\nWithout warning, masked men wearing dark robes suddenly leap onboard as the ship moors at the dock. Daggers glint in the moonlight and arrows whistle through the air. Soon five dead smugglers are floating with their faces down in the murky water below the docks, and the galley and its cargo, now under the command of [ambushing_son.GetFirstName], slips away towards a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_186;You are drawn to your balcony in the middle of the night by someone calling your name. A group of riders with torches are standing just outside the walls of your palace, and you recognize [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] among them. In front of them, with his hands tied behind his back, stands [ambushing_son.GetFirstName]. "One of my ships had a visit from some of your men, [Root.GetFirstName]," [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] calls out. "They have all been dealt with, but I want a little something for the effort I spent tracking down your whelp."\n\nYour son pulls free from the riders, and shouts up at you: "Don't do it, father! Don't trust these [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] bastards!" [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] knocks [ambushing_son.GetFirstName] to the ground with the pommel of his sword. "Give me what I want, [Root.GetFirstName], and your boy will live. Otherwise..." He levels his sword at your son's head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_191;The port in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] is particularly busy today, but you have decided to take a small trip on one of your family's galleys and have no intention of cancelling your plans. Your captain skillfully guides the ship through the jumble of merchant vessels and towards the open sea. \n\nYou have nearly left the harbor area when another galley flying [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] colors recklessly cuts in front of you! The two galleys collide with the sound of splintering wood, but with the exception of several broken oars, there doesn't seem to be any serious damage to either ship. From the deck of the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley, [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] screams obscenities at you and accuses you of trying to ram his ship on purpose. He demands the right of way to leave the port before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_192;Your ship is readied for battle, and [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] immediately responds in kind. Bowmen take up position at the railing and hails of flaming arrows are soon exchanged between the ships. Nearby merchant vessels hurry to distance themselves from the duel, and as the furious battle continues both galleys drift out of the harbor and far out to sea.\n\nThe rigging of the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley has caught fire, but you have little time to celebrate this victory as your own ship is taking on water. A savage boarding action unfolds as both crews fight to escape their equally doomed ships. When the smoke settles, both galleys have slipped beneath the waves and you and [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] are desperately clutching to the same piece of flotsam, shouting insults at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_194;You drift at sea for what seems like days, until you and [feuding_patrician.GetTitledFirstName] are finally picked up by a passing galley. Your relief at being rescued is shortlived, however, when the grinning captain announces to his crew: "Looks like the spider just caught a couple of flies."\n\nTo the sound of cracking whips and a steady drumbeat, you and [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] are chained and put to work as oarsmen along with the other slaves on the pirate galley. The hours pass in a haze as you toil at the oars, and you are nearly at the point of passing out when [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] shares his water ration with you. He receives a severe whipping for this, but as the guards are busy with him you notice that one of the links in your rusty chains looks ready to snap. The ship is passing close to shore, and you could probably make it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_195;Using your chain, you strangle the guard whipping [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] and break free. The rest of the slaves take this as a cue to lash out at any pirate within their reach, and the ensuing commotion gives you enough time to sever [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName]'s chains with the fallen guard's scimitar. Together you work to free the rest of the slaves, and soon a full mutiny has broken out.\n\nMany slaves are cut down, but there are enough of them to overwhelm the pirates and within moments only their injured captain is left alive. "What now?" you ask [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] as you sail back towards [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. "What now? Let me tell you what now," [feuding_patrician.GetFirstName] says. "We're even now. The feud between our families is no more. We've been through too much together." He offers you his hand in friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_201;These are hard times for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Your sworn enemies, the vile and untrustworthy [Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty under the leadership of [Liege.GetTitledFirstName], have managed to secure rulership of the Republic using guile and treachery.\n\nAs the [Liege.GetTitle] is still dependant on the favor of the majority of the patrician families, [Liege.GetFirstName] is hesitant to take overt action against your family and its supporters. This hasn't stopped him, however, from using every other avenue at his disposal to tarnish the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_203;As [Root.GetTitle], you are in a unique position to act against the [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, your old enemies. Striking at them directly might draw the ire of the other patrician families, whose continued favor is necessary to cement your dynasty's rule over the Republic, however.\n\nThe [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName]s still enjoy a lot of support in many quarters of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], but new, insidious ways of hurting them are open to you now with your current office. You have managed to tarnish their family's name and standing through an intensive lobby campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_206;Supporters of your family have clashed with [feuding_patrician.GetOnlyDynastyName] hooligans on the streets of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]! What started as a bar-room brawl quickly turned into a riot when hundreds of sailors from the merchant fleets of both families joined in the destructive melee.\n\nNearly a dozen dead have so far been reported by the city guard, and several stores were looted during the commotion. The other patrician families are not amused by this disturbance of the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
