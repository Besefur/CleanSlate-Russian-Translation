EVTDESC_RIP_12000;Some commoners have already gathered outside as your guards start closing the gates. A decisive thump silences the curious chatter coming from the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12001;Your liege, [Root.Liege.GetBestName], has decided to seclude [Root.Liege.GetHerselfHimself] and [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] court from the outside world in order to avoid the ongoing epidemic. The gates of [gates_closed_target.GetName] have been shut and any landed councillors have been sent back to their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12003;Loud complaints have become less frequent, instead an unbearable stench is now coming from the other side of the wall. It appears that as a way of showing disapproval, commoners have started leaving all their dead in a big pile just outside the gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12004;Lately, [sick_courtier.GetBestName] has been showing symptoms of illness. [sick_courtier.GetSheHeCap] might have contracted the plague. But of course, nothing is certain yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12005;Unaware of others hearing them, [lover_one.GetBestName] and [lover_two.GetBestName] have been sneaking around the premises to have intimate encounters. Few seem amused by their indiscretion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12006;[lover_one.GetBestName] tells you how wonderful and understanding you are for letting [lover_one.GetHerHim] and [lover_two.GetBestName] carry on with their romance during these months. They both promised to be of assistance if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12007;[target_courtier.GetBestName] may not be the most attractive [target_courtier.GetManWoman] I ever laid my eyes upon, but [target_courtier.GetSheHe] is here, and the whole situation is growing increasingly boring.

EVTDESC_RIP_12007_sway_version;[target_courtier.GetBestName] may not be the most attractive [target_courtier.GetManWoman] I ever laid my eyes upon, but as the days crawl by in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], I rack my brain for ways to convince [target_courtier.GetHerHim] of my good intentions. Now, I find the [target_courtier.GetManWoman] occupying my thoughts more often than not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12008;[From.GetBestName] is walking up to me with a big grin on [From.GetHerHis] face looking confident. [From.GetSheHe] smirks and suggests we should visit [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber, to kill some time as there is 'nothing better to do'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12009;[From.GetBestName] followed me into my bedchamber when I suggested we kill some time. It was well worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12009_sway_version;When I confessed my feelings to [target_courtier.GetTitledFirstName], it seemed to catch [target_courtier.GetHerHim] off guard. I almost had time to regret my decision, but then [target_courtier.GetSheHe] smiled, took my hand, and led me away...\nAs [target_courtier.GetSheHe] leaves my chambers this morning, I have a feeling it is not the last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_12011;I try to get a good night's sleep, but I am tormented by horrible recurring nightmares of our people. The pleas for help and the hurtful words begin to get to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12012;After spending lots of time with few people you have been positively surprised by [new_friend.GetFirstName]. During this difficult time you have gotten to know and understand [new_friend.GetHerHim] well. In many ways [new_friend.GetSheHe] complements you nicely and you have a good time together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12013;[epidemic_victim.GetBestName] has contracted the epidemic. Your courtiers seem worried about having [epidemic_victim.GetHerHim] stay with them inside these walls.

EVTDESC_RIP_12014;[court_physician.GetFirstName] your Court Physician informs you that [epidemic_victim.GetBestName] is suffering from the current epidemic. Having [epidemic_victim.GetHerHim] stay with the rest of you inside these walls puts you at risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12032;Your [seclusion_child.GetSonDaughter] [seclusion_child.GetFirstName] comes to your study one evening. [seclusion_child.GetSheHeCap] appears quite agitated, pacing the room back and forth for a full minute before speaking. "[Root.GetFatherMotherCap], I beg of you, please let me leave the keep. Please, you must!" You demand to know [seclusion_child.GetHerHis] reason but [seclusion_child.GetSheHe] refuses to tell you the specifics, only that it is a matter of life and death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12034_A;A guard comes to tell you that your [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] is back. First, you are relieved, but the happy feeling disappears almost entirely when [From.GetFirstName] enters your chamber with a ragged peasant [seclusion_childs_lover.GetBoyGirl] in [From.GetHerHis] tow. "[Root.GetFatherMotherCap], let me introduce [seclusion_childs_lover.GetFirstName]. We're in love and I'd like your blessing.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Angrily you knock on the door and the laughter stops, but the door remains shut. You pull it open only to see a half-naked [From.GetFirstName] hurriedly getting dressed alongside a strange [seclusion_childs_lover.GetManWoman]. What is the meaning of this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12036_A;You have just lain down in bed when someone knocks on your door. You sigh and grumble, but get up to open. It is [seclusion_informant.GetTitledFirstName] and they have brought some unwelcome news. Apparently [From.GetFirstName] married in secret. You are sure [From.GetSheHe] will come to regret it... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12036_B;One of your servants brought you a letter which arrived by pigeon this morning. It is from your [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetFirstName].

EVTDESC_RIP_12050;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] wants to talk about the old tunnels under the castle. The argument is that they should be maintained better now that times are rough - you never know when you'll have to get out, and quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12052;My liege! [secluded_steward.GetTitledFirstName] catches up with you as you are strolling down the main hall. [secluded_steward.GetSheHeCap] looks concerned and you order [secluded_steward.GetHerHim] to spit it out, whatever the news is. "The tunnels, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [secluded_steward.GetSheHe] breathes and continues to tell you that it seems somebody has been using them - guards have stumbled upon tools and torches, recently used, by the looks of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12053;Someone's been captured in the tunnels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12054;Your guards have captured someone in the tunnels! However, the person does not seem to be completely stable. Your guards' faces are not showing the usual bloodthirst when they present [captured_sneaker.GetBestName], a starved-looking and oddly jumpy person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12055;You approach the locked door warily. Inside, [captured_sneaker.GetFirstName] is talking quietly to [captured_sneaker.GetHerselfHimself]. The guards tell you that [captured_sneaker.GetSheHe] claims to have had a lover at court. They were on the way back into the castle when [captured_sneaker.GetHerHis] beloved fell ill. Devastated from the loss [captured_sneaker.GetSheHe] remained in the tunnels. \n"[captured_sneaker.GetSheHeCap] doesn't seem all there, my [Root.GetLordLady]...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12056_A;You awake in the middle of the night to a loud clamoring down the corridor. Outside your room the shadows of pitchforks paint the walls and you hear screaming.

Although, the maps weren't exactly up to date...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You halt, pretending to admire a tapestry, and the steps die out. Someone is definitely following you. As you enter your chambers you draw your knife, hide behind the door and await your pursuer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12058_A;You are absentmindedly flipping through a book after another long day when there is light tap on your door. Before you can get up, the door is opened and [captured_sneaker.GetFirstName] enters.

EVTDESC_RIP_12059_A;As the peasant rebels screamed the name of their leader, [captured_sneaker.GetBestName], you furiously charged them, hacking them down, one by one.

In the wake of the victory, you contemplate the harshness of it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12063_A;Maybe it was your [Root.GetTreasurerName] [secluded_steward.GetFirstName]? Maybe the lurker you let in somehow got them in? How long had they planned this?

EVTDESC_RIP_12063_B;That scheming lurker you let in must somehow have messaged the rebels, you think. During the chaos they called for [captured_sneaker.GetHerHim], over and over, "[captured_sneaker.GetBestName]".

EVTDESC_RIP_12064;As the door's handle slowly begins to move, you ready yourself for your ambush. A hooded figure steps over the threshold but you keep a cool head and wait for the perfect moment to strike. The would-be assassin takes another step and you make your move.

EVTDESC_RIP_12065;You almost jump out of your skin when the door's handle slowly begins to move. You knew it! As soon as the hooded figure steps over the threshold you throw yourself at them, howling, and the two of you fall to the floor.

EVTDESC_RIP_12071_B;[bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] has really spruced things up! Windows are polished, there are new drapes in place and the fine cutlery is now brought out for every meal. There is even a lute player stalking me these days, but the voice in my head says he's alright. I'm starting to think my nightmares are just nightmares.

EVTDESC_RIP_12074_A;In spite of being cooped up in the castle while death rages on outside, the spirit of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] has never seemed so alive.

EVTDESC_RIP_12074_B;The strange and long period of seclusion is over and much thanks to our recent efforts the general mood of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] has never been so great.

EVTDESC_RIP_12075_A;During yet another evening of wine-fueled relaxation I approach [bored_courtier_target.GetTitledName] just as a tall clock strikes the hour. The sound causes the lute player to halt and my courtiers to glance cautiously at each other. "Is that masked one a friend of yours?" I inquire. [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] shakes [bored_courtier_target.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12075_B;I'm in the middle of a staring contest with the masked stranger when I sneeze violently.

EVTDESC_RIP_12076;[partying_stranger.GetTitledName] has apparently disappeared from court. I've had my men look for the masked stranger, but all that has been found is their mask. It apparently smelled wretchedly, so I can't blame the servant for burning it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12077;I make my way deeper into the hall where the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] usually stands alone, a figure veiled in candlelight shadows. "Have we met?" I employ my most disarming smile - I wasn't made [Root.GetTitle] for naught! The stranger remains silent. That's when I notice the smell and I grow cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12078;"YOU!", I call one final evening, pointing at the masked figure. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] is standing in the middle of a room, seemingly with an invisible aura repelling any company. As I get closer I understand why - the smell makes me convulse, but the [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] says nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_A;The stranger seems curious and then taken aback as I approach. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me, questioningly. "Death, I presume?". The darkly clad figure shrugs, expression unreadable under the mask. Then [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] lunges at me while my courtiers gasp in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_B;The stranger tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me as I approach. I attempt a reassuring smile. "You look like you could use a walk", I say, offering up my arm. Hesitantly, the darkly clad figure takes it. My heart pounding, I lead [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] away from my courtiers. [partying_stranger.GetHerHisCap] grip is cold as ice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_C;The stranger tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me as I approach. "That is a beautiful mask!" I call to [partying_stranger.GetHerHim].

EVTDESC_RIP_12080_A;"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] reaches for you.

You throw your head back and scream as a sharp pain runs like lightning through your entire body. As you collapse to your knees you hear others screaming as well, an unholy mixture of outrage, sorrow and panic. With your last breaths you turn to see the people of your court falling to the floor as well, red light flooding the room.\n\nAnd then all was quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You scream, mostly in surprise, as you realize that [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] has simply moved through you, leaving a cold sensation in your flesh. Behind you, chaos ensues as the figure moves with unnatural speed, running as a ghost through your court and its people. Black smoke trails faintly behind [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] and the screams are mingled with the sudden and loud striking of a clock, its echoes ringing in your ears as the shadowy creature turns to look at you one last time. "Seize [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]!" you yell, but no guards heed your call. As you are watching [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] the stranger becomes translucent. Before you know it, you're staring at the thin air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_D;Walking side by side with [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] you are stewing over your suspicions. Would Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself] really be so brass as to show up at your court? Has the Reaper nothing better to do? Surely this is just some plague-ridden spy! Yet [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] odor really is unnaturally repugnant...\nYour ruminations are interrupted by a low hiss - it hasn't taken the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] long to figure out your plan. The ballroom trapdoor is quite visible, even if you are not Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself] and possessing, one could presume, some measure of superior senses. By your side, you feel the nails of the creature digging into your skin, which then begins to turn black, filling with buboes. You scream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_E;"Oh yeah, we've met before. We had tea?", you continue. Death shakes [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head, black smoke twirling around [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]. Your courtiers, who have been shocked into silence, are beginning to frantically move about, looking to all at once exit the room. Stumbling over one another, Death creeps towards them, as if not really in a hurry. You notice that each person [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] brushes past gently collapses to the floor, before even having time to scream or call for help. "How dare you?!" you yell, outraged at the impudence. "Those are my guests!" [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] then turns to you, approaching quickly in a cloud of darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_A;"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious stranger reaches for you. You quickly duck out of [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] way, a motion accompanied by an appreciative gasp from your courtiers. The creature seems taken aback, but slowly spins towards you again. "Take this!" a guard bellows as a tall candelabra is thrown to you, candlelights ablaze. Hesitating for only a second, you decide to wield it as you would any fighting cane - you begin swinging the fiery weapon passionately in the direction of what you decide must be Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself]. "LEAVE this place!" you roar, ushering [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] away from the crowd. Then, in a sudden poof of black smoke, you find your opponent gone. The room grows quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_12081_C;The sensation of being run through by Death itself is not something that you could quite explain. As it happens you inhale sharply, expecting pain to shoot through your body, expecting your vision to blur, or at least your knees to give way. When nothing happens, the ghostly apparition of a [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] turns around, throwing [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] hands out in the air, seemingly confused.\n"I guess it doesn't work on me?" you offer, something apologetic in your voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_D;Sweat begins to trickle down the side of your brow as you get closer to your goal. You realize that the ballroom trapdoor is clearly visible, if one knows what to look for. "So the weather we've been having lately, eh?", you blabber nervously. The masked figure by your side stiffens a little before exhaling deeply, causing a cold draft through the room and your hairs to stand on end. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] answers in a hollow voice: "It's such a chore, this job, honestly. It's easier when you folks make war, reaping each oth-".\nThe words are cut short as you hit the switch on the wall, sending the creature falling to your basement. A small puff of black smoke lingers by your side and your courtiers begin to clap as you drag the carpet back over the trapdoor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Stumbling over one another, Death creeps towards them, as if not really in a hurry. "Wait!" you yell. "Can't we make a deal? I hear you like that?" Your invisible friend Jarvis nods solemnly as you offer him up to Death in exchange for the lives of your courtiers. Death appears to throw [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head back, as if in a hearty chuckle. People stare at you in awe as the darkness suddenly leaves the room. You'll miss Jarvis, but this is exactly what happened in your dream. He knew the stakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
