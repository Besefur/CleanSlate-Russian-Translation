succ_byzantine_elective;Imperial Elective;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike Feudal Electors, each member of the Imperial Court has a different voting strength, based on his prestige, minor titles and attributes, making some electors more influential than others. The Emperor wields the most influence, unless disfigured, deformed or underage. Close relatives of the ruling Emperor, Commanders, Marshals and Claimants are all viable candidates for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_catholic_bishopric;Bishopric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_catholic_bishopric_desc;If the liege lord has nominated a successor, he succeeds. Otherwise, the Papal Candidate is chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_eldership;Eldership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_eldership_desc;The oldest and wisest members of the tribe are given the authority to determine a proper successor amongst the members of the current ruling dynasty.

succ_elective_gavelkind;Elective Gavelkind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_elective_gavelkind_desc;The titles of the ruler are divided among his children and the primary heir, who is elected from among the members of the ruling dynasty. The law defaults to Primogeniture. You get no Prestige penalty for having unlanded sons, and can have a §Y30%§! larger demesne. Destruction of titles under any form of Gavelkind succession is not allowed. On succession in kingdoms and empires, new kingdoms might be created for younger sons if possible. Junior heirs always get the choice to declare independence without a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_feudal_elective;Elective Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_feudal_elective_desc;The ruler and each lower rank vassal (i.e. the dukes if the ruler is a king) can nominate a successor from among themselves and legitimate children and siblings of the ruler. Dukes are valid electors in both kingdoms and empires. Elective Succession is very popular with the vassals, but they will not approve if their liege personally holds too many elector titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_gavelkind;Gavelkind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_gavelkind_desc;The titles of the ruler are divided among his children, with the oldest getting the primary title. If the ruler has no children who can inherit, the law defaults to Primogeniture.

Destruction of titles while under Gavelkind succession is not allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_hre_elective;Princely Elective;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_hre_elective_desc;The Emperor and the seven Prince-Electors can nominate a successor from among themselves, any legitimate children and siblings of the ruler, as well as any other major De Jure vassal of the Empire, as long as they share the same religion with the current Emperor. If an historical elector title is held by infidels or does not exist, another dejure vassal will take its place. If the Empire is run under §YPapal Investiture§! or by a §YDogmatic§! religion, the Prince-Bishops hold a greater sway over the election. [GetPrincelyElectorsList];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_nomad_succession;Nomad Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_nomad_succession_desc;Under Nomad Succession, the son or brother with the most Prestige normally inherits, but prestigious Clan leaders also stand a chance if their Population is bigger than the Khagan's. Wrong-culture characters are disqualified and adults have precedence over children. If the Khagan's primary heir is still a child, the Khaganate is lost to one of the Clan chiefs. Clan chiefs with more Prestige than the heir get Claims on the Khaganate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

succ_seniority_desc;The oldest member of the dynasty inherits all titles. Your oldest child will greatly disapprove of this law, but all other members of the dynasty will approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_tanistry;Tanistry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_tanistry_desc;The ruler and all vassals at one and two ranks below can nominate an heir - the Tanist - from among the members of the ruler's dynasty. Vassals will tend to favor older members from other branches of the family, especially claimants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_turkish_succession;Open;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succ_turkish_succession_desc;The most powerful child of the ruler succeeds, though other influential children are likely to intervene... The law is very popular with your offspring, with the exception of the oldest one. The rest of your dynasty also approves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
