EVTDESCAHF21127;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] truly hates me. Before I can even think about making [sway_target.GetHerHim] like me, I should try to apologize about the past offenses that are the cause of [sway_target.GetHerHis] current animosity towards me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21128;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wished me to know of how deeply and truly sorry [From.GetSheHe] is for causing me so much pain in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that I will forgive [From.GetHerHis] past slights and give [From.GetHerHim] another opportunity to earn my trust and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21131;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me in an attempt to apologize for the many offenses [From.GetSheHe] has subjected me to in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that I will forgive [From.GetHerHis] past slights and give [From.GetHerHim] another opportunity to earn my trust and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21132;Despite my sincere show of contrition, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has rejected my apology. [From.GetHerHisCap] vile and resentful nature has clearly gotten the better over [From.GetHerHis] reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21133;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is ready to forgive me for my past behavior. Unfortunately, the list of indignities I subjected [From.GetHerHim] to is a long one. I think I might need still some time before I can truly start swaying [From.GetHerHim] to my cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21134;It appears [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s suspicious nature made [From.GetHerHim] wary of my apology. I might have to find another way to make [From.GetHerHim] believe that I am sincere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21135;Despite my sincere show of contrition, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has rejected my apology. [From.GetHerHisCap] vile and sadistic nature has clearly gotten the better over [From.GetHerHis] reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21136;Despite my show of contrition, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has rejected my apology. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the sting of the cruel actions I committed against [From.GetHerHim] is still too vivid in [From.GetHerHis] mind to allow [From.GetHerHim] to grant me forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21137;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! has passed away. I can only hope [From.GetSheHe] remembered me fondly in [From.GetHerHis] last moments...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21138;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! has passed away. I guess I will have to find another plaything to torment now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21142;I was happy to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I are of one mind on this issue. We will both refrain from using underhanded tactics against each other during this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21143;The messenger came in this morning to inform me that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to accept my offer of peace. The war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21144;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to trust me and accept my offer and meet me during a momentary truce. While it is unlikely that this meeting will result in a settlement of our dispute, it might help us to maintain a healthy relationship in spite of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21146;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was flattered by the honors I bestowed upon [From.GetHerHis] troops and was happy to reciprocate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21147;Sadly, [From.GetTitledFirstName] ignored my flattering message regarding the bravery of [From.GetHerHis] troops and the skill of [From.GetHerHis] commanders in battle. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not believe me to be truthful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21148;I have been betrayed! [From.GetTitledFirstName] took advantage of my trust to ambush me during our meeting, breaking the truce that [From.GetSheHe] [From.GetHerselfHimself] had called. I am now at [From.GetHerHis] mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21149;My plan worked brilliantly! I have caught [From.GetFirstName] during our brief meeting. While breaking the truce has considerably hurt my reputation, this trickery could bring a quick resolution to this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21150;I was not wrong to trust [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The truce allowed us to discuss many things and clarify our respective reasons to fight this war against each other. Even though we were unable to reach a peaceful resolution, I think that we have come to respect each other quite a bit more after this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF21151;Thankfully, the truce I called for allowed me and [From.GetTitledFirstName] to discuss many things and clarify our respective reasons to fight this war against each other. Even though we were unable to reach a peaceful resolution, I think that we have come to respect each other quite a bit more after this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for the terrible treatment I subjected [sway_target.GetHerHim] to in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF21128;[From.GetTitledFirstName]  wished me to know of how deeply and truly sorry [From.GetSheHe] is for causing my family so much pain in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that I will forgive [From.GetHerHis] past slights and give [From.GetHerHim] another opportunity to earn my trust and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF21131;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me in an attempt to apologize for the many offenses [From.GetSheHe] has subjected my family to in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that I will forgive [From.GetHerHis] past slights and give [From.GetHerHim] another opportunity to earn my trust and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF21133;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is ready to forgive me for my past behavior. Now that we have finally put behind us old quarrels, we can start to know each other better and build trust between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF21127;Given the horrible mutilation I have caused [sway_target.GetHerHim], it is no wonder that [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] hates me. If I wish for [sway_target.GetHerHim] to ever like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for the terrible treatment I subjected [sway_target.GetHerHim] to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for having unjustly held [sway_target.GetHerHim] captive in my dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for attempting to murder [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for the terrible pain I inflicted upon [sway_target.GetHerHim] by torturing [sway_target.GetHerHis] own family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCGHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for the terrible crime I committed by executing [sway_target.GetHerHis] own child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF21140;Despite now being [sway_target.GetHerHis] opponent in war, I still feel as if I can try reaching out to [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] in some way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for attempting to kill [sway_target.GetHerHis] own spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIHF21127;If I wish [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to like me, I should first and foremost try to apologize for attempting to kill [sway_target.GetHerHis] own family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF21128;I don't care about [From.GetHerHis] excuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21129;Liar! I won't fall for [From.GetHerHis] tricks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21130;[From.GetHerHisCap] groveling is as amusing as it is fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21133;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21134;How tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21135;I suppose [From.GetHerHis] behavior is not entirely unjustified...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21136;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] needs some more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21138;Too bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21140;If we fight, let us fight honorably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21141;Agreed. Let us fight honorably!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21142;Marvelous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21143;This is wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21144;This is the perfect opportunity to capture [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21145;Curses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21146;How kind of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21147;What a pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21148;You dishonorable scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21149;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF21150;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a good [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF21128;Very well, I will give [From.GetHerHim] another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF21131;I cannot forgive [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF21140;Can we not put an end to this unnecessary conflict?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF21141;Let peace win the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF21144;I will make my reasons clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF21140;Let us meet under armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF21141;I am happy to meet [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF21140;I honor the bravery of your troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF21141;I cannot agree to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF21141;Your troops proved to be just as brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHF21141;If only I could say the same about yours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP21013;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In it, [From.GetSheHe] described in cordial and reasonable terms how our realms would greatly benefit if we maintained friendlier relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, informing me that [From.GetSheHe] is in absolute agreement – good relations are a necessity between rulers as wise as us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. I have to assume that my dispassionate plea for a healthy and prosperous relation between realm did not pierce through [From.GetHerHis] skepticism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21018;[From.GetFirstName] is really trying [From.GetHerHis] best to impress me. I cannot deny that [From.GetHerHis] recent attempts to win my favor have been more than successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] have not been in vain. I am slowly but surely winning over the [From.GetManWoman]'s friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21022;I have just received the most delightful work of art from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] sent it to me without expecting anything in return. In the letter accompanying it, [From.GetSheHe] wrote that [From.GetHerHis] only hope is that I appreciate this munificent gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21023;It seems I did not spend all that money in vain. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled by my gift and told me [From.GetSheHe] was struck by my thoughtful gesture. I really made a good impression on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21024;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent no response after my generous gift. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21027;I have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is sparing no compliments when talking about me to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen. Thanks to [From.GetHerHis] kind words, I am acquiring quite the reputation in [From.GetHerHis] realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21028;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was struck by the stream of honors I have showered [From.GetHerHim] with. I doubt [From.GetSheHe] will soon forget my kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21029;My attempts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] were not very successful: [From.GetSheHe] has ignored all the good rumors I have spread about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21032;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a very detailed letter dealing with strategic warfare, taking examples from [From.GetHerHis] own studies and personal experiences in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21033;My letter was very appreciated it seems: [From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back to thank me for the thoughtful gift, remarking that [From.GetSheHe] will treasure what [From.GetSheHe] has learned from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21033_COURT;My dissertation on military matters was very appreciated it seems: [From.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for sharing my knowledge with [From.GetHerHim], remarking that [From.GetSheHe] will treasure what [From.GetSheHe] has learned from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21034;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s response to my letter was cold and hastily written. Whether [From.GetSheHe] is uninterested in military matters, or [From.GetSheHe] doubts the validity of my suggestions, it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] was not impressed by my letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21034_COURT;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s response to my military dissertation was cold and disinterested. Whether [From.GetSheHe] is does not care about military matters, or [From.GetSheHe] doubts the validity of my suggestions, it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] was not impressed by my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21037;A few envoys from [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to my court. They explained that their [From.GetTitle] believes having them stay here will help the two of us to maintain better relations with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21038;Just as expected, my diplomats were able to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of what an honorable and trustworthy ruler I am, a [Root.GetManWoman] that is well worth [From.GetHerHis] respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21039;Unfortunately, my diplomats were unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of my good intentions. I am afraid I will have to try something different to earn [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21041;I wonder if [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] would appreciate learning more about the benefits of hard work from me? I cannot think of anything else right now that would help [sway_target.GetHerHim] like me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21042;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a letter describing in detail the tricks and rules of statesmanship that [From.GetSheHe] has learned during the course of [From.GetHerHis] life, hoping it would endear [From.GetHerHim] to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] answered to my letter admitting that [From.GetSheHe] has much to learn from me and has really appreciated me taking some time off my duties as [Root.GetTitle] in order to teach [From.GetHerHim] something about statesmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21044;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to my letter was cold and detached. I am unsure whether [From.GetSheHe] is simply uninterested in the subject or [From.GetSheHe] thinks that I have poorly presented it, but [From.GetSheHe] was certainly not impressed by my gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to gift me one of [From.GetHerHis] most prized books, hoping it will help me in my search for knowledge as it helped [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] own endeavors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21048;It was not easy separating myself from such a precious book, but my gesture was not in vain. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was quite impressed by my thoughtful gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21049;I was shocked to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has not even attempted to read the book I gifted [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] might not be interested at all in my present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21052;I have just received the most depraved letter I have ever read. Under the use of clever metaphors and impeccable style, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has hidden some of the most grotesque and strangely alluring activities performed by man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21053;I received a response from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In the letter, [From.GetSheHe] wrote of how much [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed reading the poetic masterpiece that I created for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21054;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my gift for whatever reason. I guess I will have to try thinking about some other way to tease [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21057;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to share some of the exotic food [From.GetSheHe] has discovered in [From.GetHerHis] many years of epicurean adventures. The packaged goods look quite fresh and extremely inviting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21058;I was happy to know that my offer yielded positive results. Not only has [From.GetFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has very much appreciated my food, [From.GetSheHe] cannot wait for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21059;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not impressed by my offering of food. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is simply not one to enjoy eating as much as I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21062;[From.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to spend an afternoon at [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], sightseeing. It wasn't a very lively experience, we barely even talked, but it was strangely soothing looking at the horizon for a few hours together...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21063;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has really appreciated my kind gesture, far more than I could have hoped for. I guess this is just further proof that I do not need to overexert myself in order to achieve excellent results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21064;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not too impressed by my act of friendship. Perhaps I should have put a little more effort into it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21067;I just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In it, the [From.GetTitle] describes the virtues of quick thinking and resolute action. It is an interesting read to be sure, albeit very short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21068;Just as expected, my letter was well received by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has written me a short message in response to congratulate me for my wisdom and foresight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21069;Despite my attempts to solicit a clear response from [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] remains uneasy around me. I wonder what could be the cause...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21072;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. In it, [From.GetSheHe] espouses all of [From.GetHerHis] supposed virtues, and suggests that any [Root.GetTitle] would die to receive all of this attention from [From.GetHerHim] as I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21073;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has showered me with justly-earned praise after the kindness I did to [From.GetHerHim]. There is no doubt [From.GetSheHe] has been struck by my show of prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21074;How peculiar... [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not impressed by my generous gift. Has my splendor reached such magnitude that common people are too blinded by it to recognize what it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21076;I know that there must be a way to earn [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s trust, and the best way to learn it is without a doubt talking to [sway_target.GetHerHim]. But about what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter expressing [From.GetHerHis] fervent desire to know me better, so that we can come to be good acquaintances. If nothing else, it was a thoughtful and kind gesture from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was more than happy to talk to me about [From.GetHerHis] struggles and aspirations. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] seems to have questions for me as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that we do not know each other well enough to reveal details about [From.GetHerHis] personal life to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21081;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was very thorough in [From.GetHerHis] treatment. I feel a lot better now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21082;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was not as bad as I feared: [From.GetSheHe] didn't do much, but I still feel a bit better after [From.GetHerHis] visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21083;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the Physician sent to me by [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], was not as good as I hoped. In fact, I fear [From.GetHerHis] treatment has worsened my condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21086;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me an envelope containing the rotten head of some no-name bard who, allegedly, was writing songs mocking me. Judging by the message sticking from the bard's mouth, [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently thinks this gruesome gift will make me like [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21087;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back to inform me of how much [From.GetSheHe] has loved my gift. [From.GetSheHeCap] cannot wait to repay [From.GetHerHis] debt by sending me something terrible of [From.GetHerHis] own making.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21088;Despite all the care that I put in preparing [From.GetHerHis] gift, [From.GetTitledFirstName] claimed that [From.GetSheHe] would have preferred if I limited myself to a simple letter wishing [From.GetHerHim] good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21091;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a sublime piece of poetry. It is quite entrancing to listen to. By hearing it one would think me the most beautiful [Root.GetManWoman] on Earth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21092;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thoroughly impressed by my poem and openly stated that I must be the best living writer in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to be able to write such beautiful rhymes about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21093;How unfortunate. After all the time I spent writing it, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not even like my poem about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21095;Outrageous! [From.GetTitledFirstName] is refusing to lead my armies! [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetHerHis] obligations towards [From.GetHerHis] friend [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] have overcome [From.GetHerHis] loyalty towards me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21096;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to set aside [From.GetHerHis] sword and proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] refuses to fight any longer for [From.GetHerHis] liege in a war against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21102;I am no stranger to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s [From.GetHouse], but spending such a long period of time with my [GetFromRelation] is not something I am accustomed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21113;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] library has made me develop a love for book and literary studies that I did not thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_AMBITIOUS;I have been thinking about [From.GetTitledFirstName] as of late, and of all the feats that [From.GetHerHis] tenacious spirit has allowed [From.GetHerHim] to accomplish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_ARBITRARY;Talking for so long with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has allowed me to reflect a lot upon the nature of law and honor. Maybe there are some instances where I am too strict with my judgment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_BRAVE;My visit to [From.Capital.GetName] was a true inspiration for me. Witnessing how brazenly [From.GetTitledFirstName] faces any danger has forced me to look in shame at my own cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CHARITABLE;I was truly struck by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s generosity during my visit, and by the joy and prestige it brought [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should endeavor to be more charitable myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CHASTE;Talking so much with a chaste person such as [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started to make me question if I should put a stop to my libertine ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CONTENT;Seeing how peaceful and happy [From.GetTitledFirstName] is during my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] made me wonder if, in my search for glory, I am simply wasting my life in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CRAVEN;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has really opened my eyes regarding the many dangers of this world. Perhaps I ought to be more careful with my life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_CYNICAL;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] for so long has deeply shaken my faith in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is right, perhaps there is nothing waiting for us beyond death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_DECEITFUL;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has opened my eyes to how easily people can be manipulated by using the right words. It might not be an honest attitude, but it seems to serve [From.GetHerHim] well to avoid conflicts and be a successful [From.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_DILIGENT;Witnessing how much [From.GetTitledFirstName] is able to do in a single day and the satisfaction on [From.GetHerHis] face after a job well done left a strange impression on me. Maybe I should strive to be more diligent in my own duties...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_ENVIOUS;Reflecting upon my time spent with [From.GetTitledFirstName] and how respected [From.GetSheHe] is by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I am starting to think that, being so kind and submissive might be the reason why some of my peers and vassals are so reticent to obey to my orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GLUTTONOUS;[From.GetTitledFirstName] subjected me to all sorts of delicacies and lavish feasts during my visit. Now that I am back home, I am finding myself still craving for more than what my frugal diet can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GREEDY;Until a few weeks ago, I was sure that my duties as a [Root.GetTitle] bound me to show a certain amount of generosity towards all my subjects, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] showed me that there might be some virtue in parsimony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_GREGARIOUS;During my visit I couldn't believe how comfortable my host was when talking with me as well as with all of [From.GetHerHis] other courtiers, and what positive effect [From.GetHerHis] welcoming attitude had on the entire court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_HONEST;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] during my visit to [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse] has brought me to question my lack of honesty. Lying has always been a convenient solution to many of my problems, but is it worth the taint upon my reputation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_HUMBLE;I always thought diminishing one's achievements was a sign of weakness, but, after witnessing [From.GetFirstName]'s behavior during my visit at [From.Capital.GetName], and seeing how positively [From.GetHerHis] humble demeanor is received by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I wonder if I should strive to imitate [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_JUST;Talking for so long with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has allowed me to reflect a lot upon the nature of law and honor. Maybe my lack of coherence when exacting judgment is negatively affecting my realm more than I originally believed or than should I tolerate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_KIND;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s kind and gentle spirit were a baffling thing to experience during my visit, yet I cannot deny that the warmth [From.GetSheHe] received from [From.GetHerHis] subjects because of [From.GetHerHis] kindness was strangely alluring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_LUSTFUL;All throughout my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] I could scarcely believe how liberally my host satisfied [From.GetHerHis] lust, without as much as a scolding look from [From.GetHerHis] subjects or peers. Maybe I am holding myself to a higher standard than I should...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_PARANOID;Even now that I am back home, the worries instilled by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s paranoid ramblings still torment me. Perhaps I am too trusting, perhaps there are indeed enemies hiding amongst my friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_PATIENT;Seeing how patient and responsible [From.GetTitledFirstName] was during our time together amazed me. Can a person really be so calm even in the face of adversity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_PROUD;Reflecting upon my time spent with [From.GetTitledFirstName] and how respected [From.GetSheHe] is by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I am starting to think that, being so humble and submissive might be the reason why some of my peers and vassals are so reticent to obey to my orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_SHY;Seeing how [From.GetTitledFirstName] reacted to my open and friendly demeanor has brought me to question my character. Maybe it is inappropriate for a [Root.GetTitle] like me to act in such an open and informal manner with my subjects and peers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_SLOTHFUL;Seeing how calm and relaxed [From.GetTitledFirstName] was for the entire duration of my visit is making me wonder if I am taking my duties as [Root.GetTitle] too seriously...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_TEMPERATE;Being forced to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s frugal meals was a little unbearable at first, but now that I am back home I wonder if it wouldn't be best for my health to adopt [From.GetHerHis] diet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_TRUSTING;During my visit at [From.Capital.GetName], I was initially surprised by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s trusting nature, but, now that I am back home, I found myself longing for that sense of safety and peace that I saw in my host's eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_WROTH;Reflecting upon my time spent with [From.GetTitledFirstName] and how respected [From.GetSheHe] is by [From.GetHerHis] subjects, I am starting to think that, being so calm and submissive might be the reason why some of my peers and vassals are so reticent to obey to my orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP21124_ZEALOUS;Talking with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has awakened a new fervor in my heart. Maybe my attitude towards [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] was too dismissive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHFP21013;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] used extremely magniloquent terms to describe how much [From.GetSheHe] appreciates my work as [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, expressing how touched [From.GetSheHe] was by my wonderful message about peace and friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. How could [From.GetSheHe] not be touched by my poetic plea for friendship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21018;[From.GetFirstName] has shown time and again that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be my friend. After so many shows of courteous behavior, I find myself increasingly obligated to return the favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] have not been in vain. I am slowly gaining [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21022;I have just received a very thoughtful gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] sent it to me without expecting anything in return. In the letter accompanying it, [From.GetSheHe] wrote that [From.GetHerHis] only hope is that I appreciate [From.GetHerHis] kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] received my gift really well. [From.GetSheHeCap] informed me that it was a very kind gesture, one that [From.GetSheHe] will not soon forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21027;I have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is spending a great deal of words talking about my integrity and my honor when talking to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21028;It seems that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been truly touched by the honors I bestowed upon [From.GetHerHim]. I am sure [From.GetSheHe] has come to like me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21032;I have heard a lot about [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s military exploits in recent weeks. If even half of them are true, there is no doubt a [From.GetManWoman] of such bravery and brilliance is deserving of anyone's respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21033;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to be very impressed by the stories I have spread about my military prowess. [From.GetSheHeCap] has openly praised my bravery and military brilliance, in a clear show of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21034;I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] is simply uninterested in these matters or unimpressed with my delivery, but it is certain that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded well to the stories of my military life as well as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21037;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a very skillfully written letter to explain [From.GetHerHis] ardent wish to maintain a good relationship between two honorable rulers such as we are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21038;My words achieved the expected result: [From.GetTitledFirstName] responded to my appeal for unity by telling me that [From.GetSheHe] is in complete agreement with me and wishes only for us to be in good terms with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21039;Unfortunately, my letter was unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] of my good intentions. I am afraid I will have to try something different to earn [From.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21041;I might understand more about money than I do about people, but that doesn't mean I couldn't use my extensive knowledge of my realm's economy to impress [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21042;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to share some of the wealth of [From.GetHerHis] realm with me in a show of good faith, hoping that it would help me trust [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has greatly appreciated my offering to [From.GetHerHis] realm. [From.GetSheHeCap] assured me that [From.GetSheHe] will put it to good use and remember my generous act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21044;[From.GetTitledFirstName] took my generous offering and did not even thank me! Whether it was because of greed or disdain towards me, my attempt to sway [From.GetHerHim] clearly failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me the most thoughtful letter. In it, [From.GetSheHe] explored all the proper rituals of worship that any good [From.Religion.GetName] should follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21048;[From.GetTitledFirstName] received my small essay very positively. [From.GetSheHeCap] wrote me back that [From.GetSheHe] is humbled by gift and that [From.GetSheHe] is eager to test the efficacy of the rituals listed within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21049;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have dismissed my theological essay without much thought. I truly hoped that [From.GetSheHe] would be more interested in the matters of faith...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21052;I was somewhat surprised to be approached by a group of high-class courtesans during a nightly fair. They claim to be a gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21053;At least according to the reports of the group of prostitutes, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was extremely satisfied by my present. I suppose I will have to take them on their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21054;Not only [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not appreciate my gift, [From.GetSheHe] wished to make it expressly clear that [From.GetSheHe] found the very notion of it repulsive, and wished for such subjects to never be brought up ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21057;[From.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to a formal dinner with [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is well-known for [From.GetHerHis] lavish feasts and exotic foods, so this might be a very enjoyable experience for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21058;I was happy to know that my offer yielded positive results. [From.GetFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has very much appreciated my food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21059;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was repulsed by my offering of food. Perhaps I chose the wrong approach to win [From.GetHerHim] over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21062;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Chancellor sent me a very polite letter inquiring about my health and good fortune. [localized_chancellor.GetSheHeCap] hopes that the two of us can learn more about each other in the future and improve our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21063;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was glad of my thoughtful gesture. I think I have earned a good rest after all the hard work I have had to put myself through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21064;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not too impressed by my act of friendship. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] openly stated that [From.GetSheHe] was insulted by the complete lack of effort I have shown in my attempt to sway [From.GetHerHim] to my cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21067;I was very surprised when, during our brief encounter this morning, [From.GetTitledFirstName] demanded that I stop my allegedly noncommittal relation with [From.GetHerHim] and openly admit my support for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21068;Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] only needed me to rough [From.GetHerHim] up a bit in order to openly admit how well we get along with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21069;My attempt to solicit a clear response from [From.GetTitledFirstName] were not well received. It appears I am too loud and direct for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s tastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21072;The most curious gift arrived today at court. [From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a statue of [From.GetHerHim], along with [From.GetHerHis] best wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21073;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is very flattered by the attention I have given [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] hopes to remain within my good graces for longer still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21074;Insulting! [From.GetTitledFirstName] had the audacity to claim that I am too full of myself! And right after I so generously expressed my friendship towards [From.GetHerHim] too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21076;I really hope [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] is doing well. I wonder if there could be something else I could do for [sway_target.GetHerHim] to help [sway_target.GetHerHim] in [sway_target.GetHerHis] endeavors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter inquiring about my good health. [From.GetSheHe] says that [From.GetSheHe] is worried about me and wishes to know that I am well, or, in case something is wrong with me, [From.GetSheHe] assures me that [From.GetSheHe] will do whatever is in [From.GetHerHis] power to aid me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was really touched by my concern and assured me that I will be the first to receive news about [From.GetHerHis] health, for better or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that [From.GetHerHis] health is [From.GetHerHis] concern only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21086;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me a long letter detailing all the repulsive and horrifying ways [From.GetSheHe] punishes [From.GetHerHis] enemies, telling me it could help me learn to deal with my own detractors. [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently thinks this gruesome gift will make me like [From.GetHerHim] more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21087;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seemed to have been put a bit off by my thoughtful present. Nevertheless, [From.GetSheHe] thanked me for taking the time to prepare it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21088;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have completely missed the point of my present. For whatever absurd reason, [From.GetSheHe] thinks that its purpose was to scare [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21091;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a sublime piece of poetry. It is quite entrancing to listen to. By hearing it one would think me the most important [Root.GetManWoman] on Earth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21092;While not exactly teeming with excitement, [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have taken the poem I have dedicated to [From.GetHerHim] fairly well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21093;Far from liking my poem about [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] was in fact insulted by it. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I am trying to mock [From.GetHerHim] with my work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21095;Outrageous! [From.GetTitledFirstName] has deserted my army! In [From.GetHerHis] parting message, [From.GetSheHe] claimed that [From.GetHerHis] obligations towards [From.GetHerHis] friend [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] have overcome [From.GetHerHis] loyalty towards me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21096;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to abandon [From.GetHerHis] liege, committing treason rather than risk fighting against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has prepared a grandiose welcoming parade for my arrival. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] greets me in person as soon as I cross the gates of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], asking me if I had a good travel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP21113;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] and learning about [From.GetHerHis] occult studies has made me develop a eerily curiosity for the dark matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHFP21013;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. It was a very quick and concise message inquiring about my good health, with a comment about the possibility of the two of us keeping more in contact with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me back, informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has taken notice of my interest in [From.GetHerHis] friendship and reciprocates vividly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not responded to my letter. Perhaps I should have tried writing in a less blunt way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21018;It is hard to see past the real selfish motivations behind [From.GetFirstName]'s fumbling attempts to gain my favor. Despite [From.GetHerHis] best efforts, I feel no more warming up to [From.GetHerHim] than I would to burned-out candle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] were unsuccessful. The [From.GetManWoman] still mistrusts me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21022;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to send me a small gift as a token of [From.GetHerHis] friendship and good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21023;Despite my lack of effort, [From.GetTitledFirstName] really appreciated my gift. [From.GetSheHeCap] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will remember my kind gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21027;I have heard rumors that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent a few good words about me when talking to [From.GetHerHis] tribesmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21028;It looks like the few words I spared for [From.GetTitledFirstName] were the only thing that was needed for [From.GetHerHim] to warm up to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21041;With my astounding knowledge in all matters of state and stewardship, it should not be too hard to sway [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] into appreciating me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21042;I have heard great tales of how rich and prosperous [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s realm is as of late. The [From.GetTitle] ruling over such a rich nation must be a very respectable person... provided that any of what I have heard is true, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21043;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have been very impressed by the tales I have spread about my realm's prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21044;Despite my best efforts to catch [From.GetHerHis] interest, [From.GetTitledFirstName] remains unimpressed with the tales of my prosperous realm. I might have to try something else in order to sway [From.GetHerHim] to my cause...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21047;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wished to inform me that I am free to take as many books as I wish from [From.GetHerHis] library in case I need any for whatever reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21048;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to be granted limited access to my library and has already taken a few books for [From.GetHerHis] studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21049;[From.GetTitledFirstName] politely refused my offering to lend [From.GetHerHim] some of my books. It appears that [From.GetSheHe] is not really interested in studying from my library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21052;I was beyond surprised to discover that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was waiting for me outside the hall of my [Root.GetHouse], ready to sneak [From.GetHerHis] arm under mine and propose in a whisper that we went for a walk in the garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21053;As I sneak out of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed in the morning, I cannot fail to notice the satisfied smirk on [From.GetHerHis] sleeping face, a clear sign that my gift was quite appreciated by the [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21077;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a letter inquiring about my religion. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to have a genuine interest in knowing more about what it is like being a [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21078;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to tell me more about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, while also not sparing a few questions for me about being a [Root.Religion.GetName]. We ended up having a very interesting theological discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21079;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was unmoved by my concern for [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] claimed that there is no point for [From.GetHerHim] to talk about [From.GetHerHis] faith to an unbeliever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21091;[From.GetTitledFirstName] wrote me a sublime piece of poetry about my realm. It is quite entrancing to listen to. By hearing it one would think [Root.Capital.GetName] the richest city in the world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP21113;[From.GetFirstName] was a wonderful host during my visit, cordial and cheerful. I wonder if I also could improve my own attitude by taking on some of [From.GetHerHis] mannerism when dealing with my guests...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHFP21018;It is hard to see past the real selfish motivations behind [From.GetFirstName]'s fumbling attempts to gain my favor. Far from endearing [From.GetHerHim] to me, [From.GetHerHis] insistence is starting to become quite annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP21019;My attempts to sway [From.GetFirstName] were a complete failure. Far from liking me more, the [From.GetManWoman] is becoming irritated by my very presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP21113;Even now that I am back home, my mind is still filled with strategies and scores from my games with [From.GetFirstName]. Visiting [From.GetHerHim] awakened in me a love for boardgames that I did not know I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEHFP21113;Life at [Root.Capital.GetName] looks tame and dreary after participating to [From.GetFirstName]'s great hunt. I never knew I could develop such an interest for this sort of activity, yet now I long to immerse myself in the wilderness once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFHFP21113;Looking at the pride and rewarding bond between [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] hawks has opened my mind about falconry. Perhaps I should try my hand at it as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCGHFP21113;[From.GetFirstName]'s garden is the envy of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetHouse], and, after exploring it in person, I can clearly see why. I wonder if I could outdo [From.GetHerHim] with a garden of my own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP21002_A;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] has secluded [sway_target.GetHerselfHimself] with the rest of the court in [sway_target.Location.GetName], presumably biding their time while disease lingers in the countryside of the realm. "It will not be possible to reach [sway_target.GetHerHim] for some time", my council informs me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21002_A_B;As both [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I are both currently weathering the disease ravaging the countryside outside, my efforts to sway [sway_target.GetHerHis] opinion of me will have to be put on hold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21002_B;As I have gone into seclusion with my court, my efforts to appease [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] will have to be halted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21003;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] is far beyond my reach. I should stop attempting to sway [sway_target.GetHerHim] to my cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21005;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] is rotting in a dungeon. I doubt I can do much to improve [sway_target.GetHerHis] opinion of me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21006;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to set me free, excusing [From.GetHerselfHimself] for ever keeping me in such poor conditions in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21008;I have been informed that [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] spends [sway_target.GetHerHis] days laying comatose in [sway_target.GetHerHis] bed. I doubt there is anything I can do anymore to endear myself to [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21010;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] is already very fond of me. Perhaps I should focus my time and resources to sway somebody else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21012;Maybe I should write a letter to [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to try convince [sway_target.GetHerHim] of my good intentions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21021;Perhaps it could help me to increase [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s opinion of me if I just sent [sway_target.GetHerHim] a gift as a show of friendship and good faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21026;I am sure that, if I use the influence I hold over my tribes to increase [sway_target.GetHerHis] standing, [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] will come to appreciate me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21031;Perhaps I should use my extensive military knowledge to impress [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] into liking me more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21036;With my illustrious education in all affairs of state and diplomacy, I should have no trouble finding the right way to endear myself to [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21046;With the use of my extensive knowledge, I am confident I will be able to sway [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] into becoming my trusted friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21051;I am thinking of a good way to sway [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] into liking me a bit more. What could possibly titillate the senses of a [sway_target.GetManWoman] like [sway_target.GetHerHim], I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21056;Surely, the way to get to [sway_target.GetFirstName]'s heart is through [sway_target.GetHerHis] stomach. Maybe I should have something prepared for [sway_target.GetHerHim] as a way to draw us closer to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21061;Thinking new ways to make [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] like me more is hurting my brain, and yet, for as much as I hate exhausting myself, something needs to be done if I ever wish [sway_target.GetHerHim] to be my friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21066;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] still resists my attempts to establish a solid relationship between us. It is quite infuriating. I wonder what I could do to make [sway_target.GetHerHim] come to [sway_target.GetHerHis] senses faster...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21071;It is so hard to think about what I could do to endear [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to me. I am already so perfect, after all. Why would anyone need encouragement in order to enjoy the pleasure of being in my good graces?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21085;What can I possibly do to endear [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to me? I am not particularly experienced in making people like me, but it cannot be *that* hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21090;I have always been better at talking through my pen. Maybe the best way to show my good intentions towards [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] is to dedicate [sway_target.GetHerHim] a poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21094;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has spent quite some time trying to befriend me, yet now we both find ourselves on the opposite sides of the battlefield. While honor compels me to fight for my liege, I feel an obligation towards [From.GetTitledFirstName] as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21098;Perhaps it is time I invited [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to spend some time with me. It is probably the fastest way for me to gain [sway_target.GetHerHis] trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21099;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been very insistent about spending some time with me recently. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that we will be on better term if only we take a few days to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21100;[From.GetFirstName] was happy to oblige me. Now that I have some time to spend with [From.GetHerHim], I am confident that I can convince [From.GetHerHim] of how alike we are and that [From.GetSheHe] stands only to gain from our friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21101;Unfortunately [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in my proposal and politely declined my invitation to spend some time with me at my [Root.GetHouse].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21105;[Root.GetSwayVisitIntro] [Root.GetSwayVisitOutro];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21106;While I invited [From.GetFirstName] to my court primarily to endear [From.GetHerHim] to my cause, I have found myself becoming very fond of [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21107;Visiting [From.GetFirstName] has really opened my eyes. I have become really fond of [From.GetHerHim], enough to call [From.GetHerHim] a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21108;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to politely refuse my offer of friendship. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs some time to learn to trust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21109;While I invited [From.GetFirstName] to my court primarily to endear [From.GetHerHim] to my cause, I have found myself becoming really fond of [From.GetHerHim] after spending this time with [From.GetHerHim], going even beyond the bonds of simple friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21110;Being with [From.GetFirstName] in these past days has changed my perspective on [From.GetHerHim] entirely. I have become really attached to [From.GetHerHim], even beyond the limits of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21111;Unfortunately, it appears that [From.GetFirstName] does not share my feelings for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21114;I have just discovered that, after my visit, [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to adopt my own lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21115;Despite any difference that we might have, I cannot deny [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was extremely gracious as a host, to the point that I now feel indebted to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] after my visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21116;[From.GetFirstName] was so struck by my generosity and kindness as a host that, just before departing, [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] now feels indebted with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21117;I tried my best to be conciliatory with [From.GetFirstName], but we simply couldn't come to an agreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21118;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. Fortunately, my host was able to deescalate the fight, and apologized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21119;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21120;Unfortunately, most of my visit to [From.GetFirstName] devolved into petty fighting about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21121;My visit was not up to a good start when [From.GetFirstName] and I had a strong disagreement about [From.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. Even worse, my host was completely unable to see my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP21123;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I have grown too far apart. It is very unlikely [sway_target.GetSheHe] will ever respond positively to my attempts to sway [sway_target.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHHFP21113;Stories about [From.GetFirstName]'s battle exploits have awakened new desires in me. I have found myself increasingly bored by my quiet life, and more drawn towards riskier and more exciting activities...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIHFP21113;During my visit to [From.Capital.GetName] I could not deny my envy for some of the architectural marvels born out of [From.GetFirstName]'s imagination. I wonder if I could follow [From.GetHerHis] example and build some monuments of my own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLHFP21113;During my stay, [From.GetFirstName] introduced me to new and unbelievable heights of pleasure and sublime, delectable experiences. Now that I am back to [Root.Capital.GetName], I have found myself longing for another taste of [From.GetHerHis] hedonistic life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP21002;If only we had pigeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21003;It would just be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21005;I could set [sway_target.GetHerHim] free...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21006;How kind of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21008;How unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21010;Yes, it is time to move my attention elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21012;Friendship between us will benefit both our realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21013;It was very nice of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21014;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21015;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21018;I can really trust people like [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21019;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21021;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] a priceless work of art.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21022;How thoughtful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21023;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21024;What a waste of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21026;I will bestow [sway_target.GetHerHim] the greatest honors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21027;How nice of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21029;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21031;Let us talk strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21032;I am impressed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21033;How could [From.GetSheHe] not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21034;How could [From.GetSheHe] not be impressed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21036;I will send an envoy to [sway_target.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21037;Very impressive, I am touched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21038;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21039;There must be other options...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21041;I will share my knowledge of statesmanship with [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21042;This letter is extremely interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21043;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21044;What a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21046;I will gift [sway_target.GetHerHim] an invaluable book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21047;I am flattered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21048;It is so rare to find someone who appreciates the value of reading...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21049;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21051;I am feeling inspired today...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21052;What an unexpected visit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21053;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21054;How boring of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21056;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] some exotic food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21057;I am happy to partake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21058;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21059;More for me, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21061;I could... invite [sway_target.GetHerHim] here for sightseeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21062;This was surprisingly nice! Thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21063;The things I do for friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21064;But I worked so much, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21066;A very concise letter will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21067_A;Brief and to the point: I like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21067_B;I guess so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21069;Bah! Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21071;I will write [sway_target.GetHerHim] a letter about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21072;That's very impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21073;How gracious of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21074;[From.GetSheHeCap] just doesn't understand me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21076;I will simply ask [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21077_A;Sure! I am happy to talk to [From.GetHerHim] about me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21077_B;I am glad [From.GetSheHe] asked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21077_C;Only if [From.GetSheHe] writes me about being a [From.Religion.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21078;This is wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21079;Disgraceful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21081;Marvelous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21083;That charlatan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21085;Isn't there a bard mocking [sway_target.GetHerHim] in [Root.Capital.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21086;And [From.GetSheHe] is right! How delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21087;How nice of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21088;Why would I ever do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21090_A;I will write about how fair [sway_target.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21090_B;I will write about how charming [sway_target.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21091;How thoughtful! I am impressed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21092;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21093;What a sad little [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21094;Enough, I refuse to fight any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21095;I cannot deny [From.GetHerHis] reasons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21096;I owe [From.GetHerHim] a great debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21098;I will ask [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21099;Sounds like a marvelous idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21100;We can finally talk in private!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21101;What a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21102;How nice to meet you, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_A;I am really glad I could spend some time with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_B;I hope these debates helped us understanding and accepting our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_C;My [Root.GetHouse] was enriched by your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21104_D;It was truly an honor to have you here for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21105;This was surely an interesting experience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21106;We have so much in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21107;And I am [From.GetHerHis] friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21108;Maybe another time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21109;I love [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21110;I must be in love with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21111;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21113;I wish to make [From.GetFirstName]'s lifestyle my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21114;I must really have impressed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21115;I owe [FromFrom.GetHerHim] a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21116;How kind of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21117;Surely, we can find common ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21118;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21119;At least [From.GetSheHe] was patient enough to hear my case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21120;We must agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21121;This is insulting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21123;I should just stop trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21124;I should be more like [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21125;Good for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21127;Let us bury these sour, old memories...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP21132;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP21005;No point to keep trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21010;No, I still wish to maintain [sway_target.GetFirstName]'s friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21012;I will charm [sway_target.GetHerHim] with my elegant writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21013;Meaningless words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21018;[From.GetSheHeCap] is certainly a good acquaintance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21021;A fancy gift should do the trick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21022;This is insulting! I deserve more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21026;I will make sure everyone knows what an honorable [sway_target.GetManWoman] [sway_target.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21027;How much is [From.GetHerHis] word worth anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21031;My military exploits are sure to impress [sway_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21032;Bah, nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21036;A few well thought-out words are all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21037;It sounds reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21041;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21042;Impressive indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21046;I will teach [sway_target.GetHerHim] about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21047;This is very nice of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21051_A;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] a few courtesans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21051_B;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] some nice, young lads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21052;Not bad, not bad at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21056;I will invite [sway_target.GetHerHim] to dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21057;Not bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21061;My Chancellor will write [sway_target.GetHerHim] something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21062;I appreciate the gesture at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21066;I will just tell [sway_target.GetHerHim] to be my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21067;What is [From.GetSheHe] rambling about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21071;I will send [sway_target.GetHerHim] one of my statues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21072;I suppose [From.GetSheHe] deserves it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21076;I wonder how is [sway_target.GetSheHe] doing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21077_A;Sorry, but that is private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21077_B;None of [From.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21077_C;A [From.Religion.GetName] would never understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21085;I will teach [sway_target.GetHerHim] how to deal with [sway_target.GetHerHis] enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21086;Thanks, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21090;I will write about [sway_target.GetHerHis] deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21091;Nice little poetry, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21094;Enough, I refuse to fight any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21095;The traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21096;How good of [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21098;The time is not right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21099;I do not have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21104_DRUNKARD;Be sure to take another sip before leaving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21106;It doesn't matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21107;And yet, I should keep my distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21109;I shouldn't lose my mind over [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21110;It is only a passing fancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21113;It would be only a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21115;Being a good host was just [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21117;I must endeavor to be patient and concede [From.GetHerHis] points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21124;Bah! Nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP21127;I never meant any of it, I swear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP21005;[sway_target.GetSheHeCap] might be freed soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21012;A forthright message is what [sway_target.GetSheHe] needs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21018;I just wish [From.GetSheHe] would stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21021;No need to spend too much on it, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21026;I can spare a few words for [sway_target.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21031;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21036;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21037;Tsk, another sycophant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21041;I will tell [sway_target.GetHerHim] of my prosperous realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21042;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21046;I will give [sway_target.GetHerHim] access to my library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21047;Books? Pah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21051;Some things are better done personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21052;This isn't really in my taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21056;Maybe this is not such a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21057;I am not one for food, sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21061;This is just too much work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21062;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21066;I cannot be bothered with this right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21067;Insulting! What is [From.GetSheHe] insinuating?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21071;I have no time for [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21072;That's a bit too self-serving for my tastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21076;I am curious about [sway_target.GetHerHis] faith...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21085;I don't have time for [sway_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21086;This is a bit too distasteful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21090;I will write about [sway_target.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21091;How tedious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP21094;I must think of my duties as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
