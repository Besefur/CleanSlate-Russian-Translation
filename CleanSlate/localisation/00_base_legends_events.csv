EVTDESC10000;My sheriff came to me today, looking harried and limping slightly.\n\n'My lord, I fear I have grave news: A band of robbers and poachers calling themselves the Merry Men of [Root.Location.GetName] are on the loose in your forest. I have tried to find them but alas, to no avail. They chased me out of the forest several times, the last time an arrow hit me straight in my buttocks!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10001;An indignant but blushing woman stormed into my great hall. She told me how a band of green-clad men had overpowered her, taken her to their hideout and forced her to yield her jewels and gold to them, everything except a simple locket. They treated her courteously and even escorted her to the edge of the forest when she had handed over her jewelry. Her shining eyes, blushing cheeks and furtive smile told me she enjoyed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10002;An indignant and fuming man stormed into my great hall. He told me how a band of green-clad men had overpowered him, manhandled him when he tried to resist and taken him to their hideout where they had forced him to yield every valuable trinket he owned, even his horse! When he had stopped resisting, they treated him courteously and even escorted him to the edge of the forest after they had taken his valuables. He demanded that I would do something about 'those Merry Men in green'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10003;My sheriff and I discussed what we should do about the outlaws and came up with two ideas. Every man and woman who had been harassed by the bandits, including the sheriff, have been told about the leader's skill with the bow. An archery contest might lure him out of his beloved forest. Another option would be to use a disguise to find the villain and bring them to court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10010;The day was perfect for an archery contest. The sun hid between clouds, a small breeze cooled the nervous and everyone seemed happy. The targets were set and ready, all that was needed now was my signal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10011;Over there! Yes, there! That's him alright. What do we do now?' The sheriff pointed at a man clad in green with a great bow in his hands. I watched him as he won effortlessly against every person foolish enough to try and match their skill against his. The man's skill with his great bow amazed me. 'This man is a great archer, too bad he's a lawless poacher living off my venison.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10012;The other contestants and I laughed hard as the old man tried to draw the bow with shaking hands. After several attempts, he finally succeeded. He closed one of his runny eyes and THUD!... It hit the bullseye. Everyone's chin hit the ground as the old man defeated his contestants one by one. The poacher we had set the trap for was nowhere to be seen, so I had to grumpily give the old man his admittedly well-earned prize: a golden arrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10013;Frustration swept through my veins as the archery contest proved unsuccessful in luring and trapping the elusive poacher. Perhaps we should try something else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10020;I removed my beautiful fur-lined cloaks and reluctantly eased myself into a peasant's stinking clothes. A woolen tunic, a small hat and muddy boots completed my disguise. Now, me own ma wouldn't even recognize me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10021;I had not even taken one step into the great forest before an arrow burrowed itself into the ground just in front of my toes. I froze for a short second before I started struggling to get my sword out of its hiding place. When I had finally freed my sword, a man clad in green stood before me. He held the greatest bow I ever seen with an arrow on its string aimed at me. 'Leave', he said and I obeyed immediately. Behind me, the forest echoed with thunderous laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10022;My stomach growled louder than the wolves howling in the distance. My search for the lawless men had taken me farther into the forest than I had imagined it would. Just a couple of hours had passed since I broke my fast but it felt like days. I kept walking and reached a small brook. As I bent down for a drink, I heard laughter and faint voices of many people coming towards me. Before I could hide, they were upon me. After a thorough interrogation where I pretended to be na√Øve or downright stupid, they allowed me to follow them to their camp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10023;My bad mood did not improve when I arrived at a small bridge across a shallow creek and a man large in stature demanded that I pay a toll to cross the bridge. I laughed in his face and he challenged me, even though I bore a sword and he nothing but a wooden staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10024;It did not seem fair to fight the man with a sword when he had a wooden staff, so I carved myself a staff before we commenced. After receiving several blows, I dodged his attack and drove the tip of my staff into his left side and as he doubled up, I hit him with all my strength. With a sigh he lost consciousness and fell into the creek. I feared he might drown so I poked at him with my staff. With a roar he exploded out of the river and up on the embankment. He grumpily admitted defeat after some persuasion and with a grimace and a limp he took me to his lawless brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10025;I carved myself a wooden staff as it did not seem fair to use a sword against a man armed only with a staff. We exchanged blows and he was both stronger and faster than I had thought him to be. He did not seem to tire and when I lowered my staff to admit defeat, he delivered a hard blow that sent me over the bridge and into the muddy water. Roaring with laughter, he helped me get up on the bridge and slapped me so hard I coughed up the last mouthful of water I had swallowed. He insisted I would follow him and meet his gang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10026;In the heat of battle, I somehow revealed to the green-clad man who I was. I tried to parry his fierce blows but I was too slow. I heard rather than felt the staff smash into my skull. When I woke up my sword, purse and opponent were long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10030;As I approached their hideout, songs, laughter and people talking reached my ears. It was more a small village hiding beneath and up in the trees rather than a lawless gang's lair. Women cooked, tended to children and babbled with the men who practiced their skills with bows and swords. A woman clothed in green and as skilled as any man with a bow caught my eye but before I could approach her, I was introduced to their leader who seemed restless and asked me hundreds of questions. In order to gain their trust, I had to prove myself to him and his gang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10031;Praying he would not recognize me, I stepped out in front of my old friend and demanded he would surrender his purse. The way he looked at me, disgust mixed with fear, could only mean he did not recognize me. I had to threaten to kill him to make him let go of the purse, and I made a silent vow to try and compensate him should I be able to ever return to my castle. His purse was heavy and so was my heart as I returned to the bandit leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10032;I insisted that the leader and I would go looking for adventure together, without any of the other Merry Men. They grumbled a bit but was silenced by the leader who thought it to be an excellent idea. As we walked down the road, we saw a man clad in horse-skin leaning against a tree. I wanted to confront the horse-man myself but the stubborn leader did not listen. While he talked to horse-man, I was attacked and tied to a tree by one of my own sheriffs! The leader of the Merry Men returned, saw me tied to the tree and killed my sheriff before he cut my ropes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10033;I slunk away from the Merry Men after having had adventures, venison and flirted with the green-clad maid. I had great fun together with the outlaws and feel no need to try and change their ways, as long as their shenanigans do not affect me. They seemed rather harmless, content to hide in their forest and occasionally robbing someone who will not suffer from losing a little gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10040;What should I do about the green-clad Merry Men and their leader?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10041;When the snores of the Merry Men echoed throughout the forest, I snuck back home and rallied my troops. I led them straight to the band of robbers and thieves. We caught every one of the bandits, the women and children were spared and set free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10042;The wedding between lady Marion and Robin was held in the forest, venison was served at the wedding feast but I let it slip, for now. The bridal couple had only eyes for each other and when the fat monk started playing a slow, beautiful song about love they joined hands and danced, still gazing into each other eyes. They did not even notice when the song turned faster and the rest of the dancers followed the rhythm, but continued dancing slowly until the stars started sparkling on the clear sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10100;The earth shook, the people screamed and buildings cracked. A cloud of foul-smelling air swept over the village, making torches and fires burn bright green for several hours. It took a couple of days repairing the cracked buildings and salvaging items from the few older houses that had collapsed, luckily everyone escaped unharmed. I slowly walked through the city, examining the buildings and noting what remained to be repaired when an excited peasant approached me. Without bothering with formalities, he told me about a giant crack in the ground just outside his farm. He wanted me to come and inspect it, and perhaps determine what to do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10101;The foul smell that had swept over the city the day the earth shook slowly crept up on us and I retched involuntarily. The wound that had burst open in the farmer's field spewed fire and brimstones and we stopped, aghast at the sight. The flames and fiery stones threatened the bare ground around the gap, the farmer was lucky his fields lay fallow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10102;Wailings, screams and cries for help seemed to emit from the burning gap. The farmer grew pale and refused to take one step further. I walked as close to the hell hole as I dared and tried to peek down. Apart from the occasional fiery stone and eyebrow-licking flame, I could see nothing. The wailings and screams seemed to increase until it felt as if my head would explode. I stumbled backward, felt the ground shifting beneath my feet and would have fallen into the pit if the farmer hadn't grabbed my arm and pulled me away from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10103;I gave the wisest men and women of my court three days to come up with a solution on how to close this gap that seemed to open the whole way to hell. Within three days, they all had thought up different solutions to the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10104;The priest walked several times around the gap, sprinkling holy water and chanting the words 'Vade retro satana! Vade retro satana!', avoiding the fiery stones and flames spewing from the gap as best he could. At the end of the third turn, he knelt and began praying, the only words to be heard 'Vade retro satana!'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10105;The cows balked in front of the gap and refused to take any step further. They had to be pushed into the gap and their miserable mooing mixed with the wailings of the tortured souls trapped in the pit until they hit the bottom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10106;Cartload after cartload of rocks and gravel were shoveled into the gap while the workers desperately tried to stay clear of the flames and fiery stones that seemed to increase in number. The screams of pain from the bottom of the pit affected the workers and some refused to keep shoveling in the gravel. I had to promise them no one was trapped down there but did not want anyone to descend into whatever madness the pit was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10107;One of the wise women told me she had a vision during the three days they were supposed to meditate on how to close the gap. She said the peril would be overcome only when I threw into the chasm what I held to be most dear, and I immediately thought of my eldest son. With a heavy heart I agreed to meet the wise woman at the pit together with my oldest son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10108;The gap finally closed! No more fiery stones and flames, no more wailing voices from the underground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10109;Despite everything, the gap stubbornly refused to close and spewed even more fiery stones and wailing voices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA10000;Bwahahaha... Sorry, do go on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10001;Give her some gold and send her away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10002;Give him some gold and send him away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10003;Too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10010;Let the contest... BEGIN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10011;Arrest and hang him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10012;What happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10013;Leave him and his gang alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10020;Let's see how this works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10021;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10022;H-hello...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10023;Easy as pie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10024;As I said, easy as pie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10025;I couldn't say no to him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10026;Now I will never catch him, nor the Merry Men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10030;Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10031;This has gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10032;This has gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10033;Fare thee well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10040;I'll hang them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10041;Kill them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10042;I wish them good luck with all my heart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10100;Why do you bother me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10101;It's just a hole in the ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10102;It's just a hole, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10103;Exorcism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10104;I think this will work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10105;I really hope this works;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10106;Keep shoveling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10107;I hope I won't regret this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10108;The priest did a fine job exorcising the Gate back to Hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10109;For Heaven's sake... what will I do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB10000;We need to set a trap for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10001;Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10002;This is outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10003;An archery contest, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10011;Perhaps I could hire him and his Merry Men as gamekeepers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10013;A smelly peasant should not arouse their suspicion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10020;Is this really befitting a [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10022;I'll run away now, bye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10023;If I promise to never return, will you let me go then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10030;Let's see what adventure we can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10031;Time to leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10032;Now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10040;I'll hire them as gamekeepers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10041;If their leader becomes my gamekeeper I will spare their lives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10100;Of course! Show the way, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10101;I must take a closer look at this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10102;I need this gap closed. Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10103;Feed it cattle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10104;This won't work. Try something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10105;I don't believe in this idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10106;This is an impossible task;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10107;There must be some other way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB10108;The Gates of Hell closed after we fed it cattle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC10000;Just ignore them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10003;A clever disguise should work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10030;This is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10031;Now I know where to find them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10032;This was... fun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10103;Try filling it with stones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC10108;The Gates of Hell was filled in with stones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD10026;This is as far as I dare take it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD10032;Time to leave and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD10103;Sacrifice the most precious thing in the world;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD10108;It took a human sacrifice but now the Gates of Hell is closed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP10001;The Merry Men makes a move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10010;An archery contest will be held;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10011;Let us see who we capture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10012;This might not work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10013;The archery contest was a success and a failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10020;A Devil in Disguise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10021;Disguise revealed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10022;Stumbles upon the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP10102;The Gate and its Tortured Souls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10103;There is a way to close the Gap, but how?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10104;The priest will perform an exorcism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10105;The demon inhabiting the gap should be satisfied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10106;The hole cannot be abyssal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10107;A sacrifice to close the gap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10108;It might work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP10109;It might not work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
