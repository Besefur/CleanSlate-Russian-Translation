EVTDESC7040;I apparently visited the local tavern yesterday, which would explain the hangover... What is worse though, is they tell me I may have blabbered about a certain 'plot'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7045;[From.GetTitledName] let everyone know about my plot to [Root.GetPlot] during a drunken stupor at the local tavern. I never should have included that drunken blabbermouth in a plot this delicate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA7040;This won't be popular...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7045;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7250;My spymaster tells me that information about my plot to [Root.GetPlot] might have leaked to someone outside the conspiracy. We do not know who yet, but maybe we will hear from him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7255;I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] has started a plot to [From.GetPlot]. What should I do with this information?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7260;It has come to my attention that you are the leader of a plot to [Root.GetPlot]. I find this most fascinating, and I bet that others would too... I suspect that you wish to keep this a secret, but my silence comes with a price.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7265;I have no choice but to accept your despicable blackmail attempt. You have been given payment in full, and I expect your silence in this matter from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7270;I will never succumb to blackmail! I rather face the embarrassment of having my plot exposed than giving you a single coin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA7250;Can my spymaster never bring me good news?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7255;A little blackmail can't hurt, can it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7260;Bastard! But I don't have a choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7270;Damn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB7255;It does not concern me. Let it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7260;I won't tolerate blackmail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7700;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is due to tour [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] in an open carriage to receive the accolades and adulation of the common folk. There is bound be an escort, but what if a few archers were placed on the [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle]'s path on certain key rooftops...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7701;Through my sources I have learned that our mutual problem will be touring a city in an open carriage. The guards will keep a close watch on the streets, but will they expect bowmen on the rooftops?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7702;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has asked for coin to hire some bowmen to ambush [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] as [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] tours [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] in an open carriage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7703;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me sufficient coin to hire some skilled archers to greet [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] with as [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] tours the streets of [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7704;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to grant me the coin necessary to hire skilled bowmen to skewer [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7705;I decided to tour [Root.Location.GetName] to receive the adulation of my subjects, but as my open carriage took a turn past the scroll depository I suddenly heard the whizzing sound of an arrow flying past mere inches from my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7706;I have been caught in a deadly crossfire! One of the arrows digs into my shoulder, and as I struggle to remove it, the final blow is delivered - an arrow strikes my temple, and my head is thrown back and to the left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7708;My carriage was bombarded with arrows, but thanks to what must surely have been the intervention of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], I miraculously emerged unscathed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7710;I have received word from my co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], that the bowmen are in place and waiting for the right moment to strike at [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7711;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my plan to ambush [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] with archers from the rooftops of [From.PlotTarget.Location.GetName]. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7712;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will soon be skewered by arrows while touring [From.PlotTarget.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7712_B;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will soon be tracked down and skewered by arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7713;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was caught in a deadly arrow crossfire between the scroll depository and a grassy knoll. Unfortunately, the scapegoat we had arranged to take the blame spilled my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7714;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was caught in a deadly arrow crossfire between the scroll depository and a grassy knoll. The story we concocted about a "lone bowman" seems to be working perfectly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7715;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] escaped the arrow barrage unharmed, and one of the captured bowmen revealed my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7716;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] escaped the arrow barrage unharmed, but at least all of the hired bowmen made a quiet escape and the conspiracy remains uncovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7720;Watching the animal pens outside [Root.Location.GetName] gave me an idea in how to deal with [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. Concentrated manure can be a very explosive substance, and if enough is gathered in a single place and ignited, the blast could prove lethal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7721;Watching the animal pens outside [Root.Location.GetName] gave me an idea. Concentrated manure can be a very explosive substance, and if enough is gathered in a single place and ignited, the blast could prove lethal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7722;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has asked for coin to buy copious amounts of explosive manure with which to blow [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] sky high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7723;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has provided the money I need to procure enough manure to see to the end of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7724;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to provide enough money to procure the manure needed for an explosion, calling it a "hare-brained scheme.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7725;Riding through the countryside together with my escort, I come upon a lonely inn. It is empty aside from a nervous-looking innkeeper who nevertheless promises food and wine at a very reasonable price. My party and I sit down at a table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7726;Soon after the innkeeper disappears into the kitchen, we notice a foul odor emanating from somewhere below the floorboards. One of my escort pulls open a loose board to reveal... a massive manure pit. Before we can react further to this bizarre find, the floor explodes beneath my feet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7728;My guards detain the innkeeper and pull open the floorboards to reveal a massive pit of manure beneath the inn. The innkeeper confesses to having been paid to ignite the manure once we were seated, blowing everyone to kingdom come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7729;My guards detain the innkeeper and pull open the floorboards to reveal a massive pit of manure beneath the inn. The innkeeper confesses to having been paid to ignite the manure once we were seated, blowing everyone to kingdom come, but his employer concealed his or her identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7730;[From.GetTitledFirstName], my co-conspirator, has sent word that a massive pit of manure has been prepared under the floorboards of an abandoned inn on a path [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will travel with [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] escort. Once they are seated at a table...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7731;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my plan to blow [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] sky high with copious amounts of manure. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7732;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informs me that [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will soon perish. A pit of manure has been prepared under the floorboards of an abandoned inn where [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will soon be dining. A single spark will send our little problem kingdom come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7733;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] perished in the manure explosion! Unfortunately, the farmer who provided the manure revealed my name...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7734;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] perished in the manure explosion! There is no trace of my complicity to be found amongst the rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7735;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered the manure and avoided the explosion. My complicity was revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7736;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered the manure and avoided the explosion. Thankfully, my role in this remains unknown...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7740;If that whelp [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is to die, we will need to buy the loyalty of someone unscrupulous nearby, like a maid or a guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7741;If that whelp we are plotting against is to die, we will need to buy the loyalty of someone unscrupulous nearby, like a maid or a guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7742;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has requested funds to buy the loyalty of a serving maid close to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. She will see to it that the child ceases to be a problem... ceases to be altogether, in fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7743;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has given me the coin I need to bribe one of the serving maids working near [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7744;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will not give me the coin I need to bribe one of the serving maids working near [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7745;As you lie in your crib, staring up at the ceiling and contemplating your future exploits, an adult enters the room. You recognize her as one of the maids, but this time there is something very cold and distant in her eyes. She approaches you with a pillow in her hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7746;The maid puts the pillow over your face and the world grows dark. With luck perhaps you will be reborn in a gentler era...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7748;As the maid draws near, you take a deep breath and produce a piercing wail that echoes through the nearby hallways. The startled maid drops the pillow and runs away before someone comes to investigate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7750;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has managed to get to one of the maids near [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. For a princely sum, she has agreed to solve our little problem for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7751;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my efforts to bribe a maid to end the life of young [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7752;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tells me that the short life of young [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will soon come to an end. A maid close to the child has been bought, and will be solving our mutual problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7753;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was smothered with a pillow by the maid we had bribed! Unfortunately, the maid was caught and revealed my complicity in this matter before she hanged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7754;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was smothered with a pillow by the maid we had bribed! She wasn't caught, and no one has any reason to place blame on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7755;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] frightened off the maid with [From.GetHerHis] wailing, but she was caught and exposed my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7756;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] frightened off the maid with [From.GetHerHis] wailing, but at least she made a clean escape and no one suspects my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7760;The fact that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is in prison can work to our advantage. If we can get someone on the inside to kill [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] and make it look like a failed escape attempt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7761;The fact that the target of our plot is in prison can work to our advantage. If we could get someone on the inside to deal with our little problem and make it look like a failed escape attempt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7762;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has requested funds to arrange for [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to die tragically in a botched escape attempt from the prison [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7763;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has given me the funds I sought to place a man on the inside of the prison where [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is jailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7764;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused me the money I needed to place a man on the inside of the prison where [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is jailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7765;While languishing in my prison cell, a new prisoner approached me with a plan to escape this forsaken hellhole. Concealed amongst the many tattoos on his back is a crude map of the entire dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7766;Using the map, we enter a hidden passageway behind the cells. Working our way to the dungeon's outer walls, we climb carefully on the parapet to avoid sentries. Suddenly, the cold hand of treachery makes itself felt as my "friend" pulls hard on my ankle and I lose my grip...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7768;The map is not a tattoo - it been carefully painted onto the prisoner's back. When confronted, he grudgingly admits that he was paid to help me escape while making certain I suffer a fatal accident in the attempt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7769;The map is not a tattoo - it been carefully painted onto the prisoner's back. When confronted, he grudgingly admits that he was paid to help me escape while making certain I suffer a fatal accident in the attempt. He claims he never saw the face or learned the name of the person who hired him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7770;[From.GetTitledFirstName], my co-conspirator, tells me that a man is now on the inside of the prison where [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] sits. He will arrange an escape attempt in which one of the prisoners will sadly suffer a tragic and very fatal accident...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7771;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my plan to arrange for [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to perish in a botched prison escape attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7772;I have been told by [From.GetTitledFirstName] that the days of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] are numbered. A man on the inside of the prison where [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is will arrange a prison break that will sadly result in a fatality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7773;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was killed while attempting to escape from prison! Unfortunately, the man on the inside who made this happen mentioned my name when he was captured...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7774;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was killed while attempting to escape from prison! No fingers will be pointed my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7775;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to take the bait and attempt an escape. My role in this plot was inadvertently revealed by our man on the inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7776;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to take the bait and attempt an escape. At least no one suspects my role in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7780;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] may be a drooling, incapable mess, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is still very much alive. Every month servants give [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] a sorely needed bath, during which so many things could go wrong... especially if those servants were in our employ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7781;The target of our plot may be a drooling, incapable mess, but it is still a very much alive drooling, incapable mess. Every month servants give our little problem a sorely needed bath, during which so many things could go wrong... especially if those servants were in our employ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7782;I have received a request from my co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], to provide funds necessary to bribe the servants giving [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] monthly bath. If paid, they will arrange for a tragic accident...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7783;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has provided, and now I have the funds needed to bribe the servants giving [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] monthly bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7784;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to provide the funds needed to bribe the servants giving [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] monthly bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7785;The stench of the drooling, incapable mass that is your body troubles even you, and to the delight of everyone around, the time of your monthly bath has finally arrived. Servants lower you into your bathtub and begin the long, arduous process of scrubbing away your filth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7786;The servants suddenly push your head under the surface and hold you down. You flail your arms about desperately with what little motor function you still possess, but it is to no avail. As the water rushes into your lungs and your life fades away, you regret lost opportunities, harsh words to loved ones and most importantly: relieving yourself in the bathtub.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7788;The servants suddenly try to push your head below the water! You muster what little energy you have and trash about wildly, causing enough of a ruckus to attract the attention of a guard. The servants are detained and reveal under torture who bribed them to end your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7789;The servants suddenly try to push your head below the water! You muster what little energy you have and trash about wildly, causing enough of a ruckus to attract the attention of a guard. The servants flee before they can be caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7790;The servants who will give [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] monthly bath have been bribed by my co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName]. They will see to it that this bath is [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] last...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7791;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lends his full support behind my initiative to bribe the servants giving [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7792;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends word that the servants giving the incapable [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] bath have been bribed and will see to it that it is [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7793;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was drowned in [From.GetHerHis] bathtub! Unfortunately, the servants we bribed for the deed revealed my complicity under torture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7794;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was drowned in [From.GetHerHis] bathtub! No one suspects the conspiracy behind this deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7795;Failure! Even incapable, [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to ward off the clumsy attempts of the servants to drown [From.GetHerHim]. The servants revealed my name under torture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7796;Failure! Even incapable, [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to ward off the clumsy attempts of the servants to drown [From.GetHerHim]. At least they had the good sense to avoid getting caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7800;Whispers have reached my ears that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is due to embark on a little boat trip. I have it on good authority that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe], like many children, has not yet learned to swim. If the boat was to flounder... well, these things happen all the time, don't they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7801;Whispers have reached my ears that the target of the plot I am backing is due to embark on a little boat trip. I have it on good authority that the child has not yet learned to swim. If the boat was to flounder... well, these things happen all the time, don't they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7802;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is requesting funds to hire a few carpenters who will sabotage a boat that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is soon to take a trip onboard. The child does not know how to swim...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7803;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me the money I asked for to hire carpenters. They will prepare the boat before [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] boards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7804;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will not give me the necessary coin to hire carpenters. They were needed to prepare the boat before [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] boards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7805;It is a beautiful day as you make your way down to the local harbor with a handful of servants. You will be going on a short boat trip today, something that has you very excited. The vessel awaits at the dock, ready to take you on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7806;The little boat sails off and you spend some time alone by the railing, staring down into the deep, murky water. Suddenly there is shouting behind you and the boat flounders, sending you into the cold water! You desperately try to stay afloat, but without knowing how to swim, you soon sink beneath the waves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7808;Upon closer inspection at your request, the sailors find that the boat has been tampered with! Had it set sail, it would surely have floundered, taking you with it below the waves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7810;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has let me know that everything has been prepared for a little boating accident [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to be the victim of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7811;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends [From.GetHerHis] approval for the sabotage of the boat that will carry [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] watery grave. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7812;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has informed me that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is moving forward according to plan. A month from now [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will be lost forever in an unfortunate boating accident...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7813;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] sank like a stone when the boat [From.GetSheHe] was on suffered an unfortunate "accident"! Sadly, it has become obvious the boat suffered sabotage, and all the evidence leads back to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7814;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] sank like a stone when the boat [From.GetSheHe] was on suffered an unfortunate "accident"! All evidence of my complicity went down with the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7815;Failure! Somehow [From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered the sabotage and the boat never left port. That meddlesome child has linked the evidence back to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7816;Failure! Somehow [From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered the sabotage and the boat never left port. At least the foolish child has no reason to suspect my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7820;There are snakes out there who can fell a grown man instantly with a single bite. If such a one was to visit [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] bedchambers at night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7822;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has asked for coin to buy a rare and extremely lethal snake. If purchased, it will pay [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] a little nightly visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7823;I have received the money from [From.GetTitledFirstName] to buy the snake. I will soon be introducing it to [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7824;[From.GetTitledFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] will not be sending the coin I need to procure this rare snake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7825;It has been a long day and it is with some relief that you retreat to your bedchamber for the night. Your bed is warm and just as you are about to drift off into sleep, you hear a strange hissing sound...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7826;Something cold and scaly brushes past your naked leg, and as you sit up, you feel a sharp pain in your upper thigh. Pulling back the covers reveals a vicious, hissing snake! You stumble out of bed, but already your sight grows dimmer as the intense pain spreads throughout your body...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7828;You immediately roll out of bed before the vile serpent has a chance to strike. The beast recoils and disappears beneath the covers as you run out to fetch the guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7830;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has procured a venomous viper, and sends word that it will soon dig its fangs into [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7831;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is delighted to learn that [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to be the victim of a savage snake attack. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7832;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. Within a month an extremely poisonous snake will be slipped into [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] bedchambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7833;Success! The snake performed its duty with aplomb and pumped [From.GetTitledFirstName] full of its deadly venom. Unfortunately, the serpent was caught and the seller has revealed my complicity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7834;Success! The snake performed its duty with aplomb and pumped [From.GetTitledFirstName] full of its deadly venom. It slipped away into the night, and the guards are now too busy contending with a string of lethal snake attacks to search for those responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7835;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to evade the snake, and the guards caught the serpent as it tried to slither away. The seller was identified and has revealed my complicity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7836;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to evade the snake which slipped away into the darkness. A massive snake-hunt is now underway, but at least no one suspects my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7840;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] likes to take in the morning air on [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] balcony. The fall would be a long one indeed if someone was to take a tumble from there... perhaps the railing could be "adjusted" slightly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7843;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent the funds I needed. I can now hire a specialist to weaken the balcony's railing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7844;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to provide the funds needed for hiring a specialist to weaken the balcony's railing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7845;Every morning, especially when the weather is as splendid as it is today, you like to go out on your balcony, lean against the railing and take in a deep breath of fresh air. The view from up here is spectacular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7846;As you lean forward on the railing, you suddenly hear the sound of splintering wood as it gives way completely and you tumble over the edge. While plummeting towards the ground, you spend your last moments reflecting on the gravity of the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7848;You inspect the railing only to discover that someone has sawed through its supports! The slightest nudge would have been enough to make the whole thing topple over the side. Had you leaned against it as usual...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7850;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has hired someone to saw through the supports of the railing on a balcony [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is known to frequent. Someone may soon take a bit of a tumble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7856;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] discovered the sabotage that had been done on the railing. At least [From.GetSheHe] is clueless as to who deserves the blame for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7860;Young [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon be going on a hunting trip to learn about the majesty of the wilds. With hounds and other dangerous beasts running around, not to mention arrows flying in every direction, so many things could go wrong during a hunt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7861;The young nuisance we are plotting against will soon be going on a hunting trip to learn about the majesty of the wilds. With hounds and other dangerous beasts running around, not to mention arrows flying in every direction, so many things could go wrong during a hunt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7862;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has requested funds to bribe one of the hunters taking young [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] on a hunting trip. An accident will be arranged...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7863;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has given me the gold I needed to bribe one of the hunters going out with [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7864;For some reason [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to provide the gold needed to bribe one of the hunters going out with [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7865;You are very excited to be going on your first hunting trip! A skilled hunter will be taking you under his wing and teaching you how to hunt and survive in the wilds. The next couple of days will be one big adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7866;The hunter tracks a rabbit and gives you the first shot. As quietly as possible, you draw your bow, take aim and send an arrow into the small animal's flank. Filled with pride you turn around, only to see the hunter aiming his own bow at you, fully drawn. "I am sorry," he whispers before sending the arrow into your throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7868;As the hunter's behavior becomes increasingly nervous and erratic you decide to confront him about it. Weeping he admits to having been paid a handsome sum to kill you during the hunt and make it look like an accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7870;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has bribed a hunter taking [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] on a trip into the wilds to quietly dispatch the child and make it look like an accident. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7871;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is pleased to learn that [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will soon meet [From.GetHerHis] end in the wilds. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7872;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. A hunter taking the [From.PlotTarget.GetLadLass] on a trip to the wilds has been generously bribed to cause a tragic hunting accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7873;Success! The hunter did what he was paid for and made sure [From.GetTitledFirstName] never returned from the hunting trip. Unfortunately, he later lost his nerve and told everyone willing to listen about my involvement as he drank away his sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7874;Success! The hunter did what he was paid for and made sure [From.GetTitledFirstName] never returned from the hunting trip. He will keep quiet about his ghastly deed to save his own skin if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7875;Failure! That fool hunter lost his nerve and refused to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]! What is more, he told the [From.PlotTarget.GetLadLass] everything about the conspiracy - including my involvement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7876;Failure! That fool hunter lost his nerve and refused to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]! At least he has decided to keep quiet about the conspiracy to hide the shame of his own involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7880;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon travel by carriage on an isolated road. Perhaps if we gathered some mercenaries and disguised them as highwaymen... crime is on the rise, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7881;The target of the plot I am backing will soon travel by carriage on an isolated road. Perhaps if we gathered some mercenaries and disguised them as highwaymen... crime is on the rise, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7882;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has asked for gold to hire some mercenaries. They will ambush [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] disguised as highwaymen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7883;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has granted me the gold I asked for to hire mercenaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7884;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will not be providing the gold I need to hire the mercenaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7885;You are travelling by carriage in the countryside of [Root.Location.GetName] when it comes to a sudden halt. The road has been blocked by a fallen tree, and the coachman explains that you will have to make a slight detour on an isolated smaller path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7886;After less than half a league on the small path, you are ambushed and surrounded by highwaymen! They send your driver on his way, explaining that their interest lies with you alone. You offer the belongings you carry with you, but they merely laugh at this - it is your blood they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7888;You force your way through the improvised barricade, narrowly avoiding an ambush by highwaymen! They send an accurate volley of arrows after your carriage as it speeds away, missing it by mere inches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7890;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has assembled a party of mercenaries who will ambush [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] disguised as highwaymen. I am assured [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will not survive the encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7891;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has communicated [From.GetHerHis] support for my plan to ambush [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] with mercenaries disguised as highwaymen. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7892;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. A party of mercenaries in [From.GetHerHis] employ will ambush [From.PlotTarget.GetFirstName] disguised as mercenaries within a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7893;Success! The mercenaries ambushed the carriage of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and made short work of [From.GetHerHim]. Unfortunately, the driver survived and saw through their disguises. My involvement is now public knowledge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7894;Success! The mercenaries ambushed the carriage of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and made short work of [From.GetHerHim]. They let the driver go, and he is convinced the attack was carried out by highwaymen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7895;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] got away from the ambush, and [From.GetSheHe] saw through the disguises of the mercenaries, identifying them as men in my employ!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7896;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] got away from the ambush, but at least the disguises of the mercenaries held up, concealing my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7900;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon embark on a lengthy journey by carriage, during which so many things could go wrong. If we could buy the loyalty of the carriage driver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7901;The target we are plotting against will soon embark on a lengthy journey by carriage, during which so many things could go wrong. If we could buy the loyalty of the carriage driver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7902;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], wants money to bribe the driver of the carriage taking [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] on a lengthy journey. An accident will be arranged along the way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7903;I have received the money from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. It is enough to bribe the driver!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7904;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided not to send me the money I needed to bribe the carriage driver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7905;You are going on a lengthy journey by closed carriage in [Root.Location.GetName] together with some of your trusted bodyguards. As you travel down a steep slope overlooking a ravine, you notice that you have begun to pick up quite a bit of speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7906;The speed of the carriage picks up even more as it hurtles down the slope. Looking through the rear window you see a waving man holding the reins of two familiar-looking horses far behind on the road. Only when the carriage flies over the edge of the ravine do you realize who it was the man reminded you of - your driver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7908;You and your guards throw yourself out of the carriage before it flies over the edge of the ravine. Far behind is your fleeing driver with the horses, but your guards catch up with and detain the man. He admits to having been paid generously to see you suffer a fatal accident during the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7910;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has sent word that the carriage [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is travelling on will soon suffer an unfortunate accident leaving no survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7911;[From.GetTitledFirstName] approves of my scheme to have [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] perish in an unfortunate carriage accident. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7912;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. A tragic carriage accident will claim [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] life a month from now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7913;Success! The carriage was sent flying over the edge of a cliff with [From.GetTitledFirstName] still in it. Unfortunately, the driver I bribed was caught and my involvement was revealed during his torture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7914;Success! The carriage was sent flying over the edge of a cliff with [From.GetTitledFirstName] still in it. The driver I bribed has also been dealt with, leaving no loose ends that can tie me to this event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7915;Failure! The carriage was sent flying into a ravine, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] jumped out moments earlier. The driver was caught and has revealed my complicity in this plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7916;Failure! The carriage was sent flying into a ravine, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] jumped out moments earlier. At least the driver was killed by [From.GetHerHis] guards before my involvement could be exposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7950;It became clear to me when hearing about [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s decadent ways that the right place to kill [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own palace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7951;All of a sudden, I realized that such decadent fools surely are the most vulnerable in their own palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7953;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to bribe [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s servants to join our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7954;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to give me the necessary funds for bribes to have [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] killed in his own palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7955;How wonderful it is to just sit at home and enjoy the 'simple' things in life. Servants, more wine please! More food too for that matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7956;A hidden dagger held by my own servant, is this really how I must die? [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me, for I have sinned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7958;I was sitting comfortably along with my beautiful servants, enjoying a cup of expensive wine after a grand dinner, when suddenly I saw one of my servants dashing towards me with a dagger in her hand. I jumped away just in time and my guards caught her before she had the time to strike again. Before she was taken care of, she uttered the name of the one behind the plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7959;I was sitting comfortably along with my beautiful servants, enjoying a cup of expensive wine after a grand dinner, when suddenly I saw one of my servants dashing towards me with a dagger in her hand. I jumped away just in time and my guards caught her before she had the time to strike again. She has been taken care of now, but I fear she was only a pawn. Who was behind this plan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7960;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will die in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own palace, with a dagger taken to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] throat by [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7961;[From.GetTitledName] approves of my idea to have [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] killed by [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own servants. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will surely forgive me due to [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s decadent ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7962;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. Several of [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] servants are loyal to our cause and we will be ready to strike in one month's time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7963;Success! [From.GetTitledName] died. Unfortunately, my complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7964;Success! [From.GetTitledName] died not knowing the name of [From.GetPossPronoun] killer. The bribed servants have been taken care of and will not speak of what happened this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7965;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] overheard our servants talking and uncovered our plot to kill [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7966;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] realized something was off and had the servants taken away. However, he was unable to uncover our plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA7700;My co-conspirators will find some good men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7702;Make it happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7705;My God. They're going to kill us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7706;This was no lone bowman. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orchestrated this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7707;Back and to the left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7708;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has conspired to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7709;Who were those bowmen working for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7710;We are committed then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7714;One less threat to the establishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7715;Go to damage control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7720;My co-conspirators will procure the necessary manure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7722;It might just be crazy enough to work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7725;Innkeeper! Bring us the best you have to offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7726;Very clever, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7727;KABOOOOOOOM!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7728;So this was the work of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7729;Perhaps this wretch was working alone. Off with his head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7730;...KABOOM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7734;[From.GetFirstName] went out with a bang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7735;What was I thinking? Manure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7740;My co-conspirators will procure the necessary funds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7742;I cannot think of a more worthy cause. Send the money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7745;Gaga...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7746;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] had my short life cut shorter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7747;Who put her up to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7748;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] put her up to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7749;Why would she harm me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7750;Fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7754;This world is too cruel for children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7755;Oh dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7760;My co-conspirators will find the man needed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7762;Yes, prison can be very dangerous to your health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7765;We can use this to escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7766;You... you're working for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7767;Who sent you to kill me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7768;So [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] put you up to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7769;You expect me to believe that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7770;No one will expect foul play on our part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7774;Sentence commuted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7775;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7780;My co-conspirators will talk to the servants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7782;Devious. I like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7785;*relieve yourself in the bathtub*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7786;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] bribed these servants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7787;Who bribed these servants?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7788;So it was [FromFrom.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7789;Who bribed them to kill me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7790;Commendable initiative!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7794;Yet another argument against taking baths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7795;Well, that's no good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7800;My co-conspirators will find some good men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7802;Send the money... and I really must learn how to swim some day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7805;This is going to be great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7806;The boat was sabotaged by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7807;Someone sabotaged the boat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7808;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] had his men sabotage the boat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7809;Who is responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7810;Ship ahoy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7814;Man overboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7815;It would have worked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7820;My co-conspirators will procure the snake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7822;Give [From.GetHerHim] the money. That serpent could be the answer to our prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7825;A carpenter will need to look at this bed tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7826;That... that serpent belongs to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7827;I hate snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7828;That snake belongs to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7829;Who brought that snake here?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7830;Just don't point that thing at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7834;I could kiss that snake! Well, maybe not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7835;I hate snakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7840;My co-conspirators will find someone who can get this done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7842;Make it happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7845;The people below look like ants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7846;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] had someone sabotage that railing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7847;I will haunt the carpenter who built that railing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7848;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] had someone sabotage that railing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7849;Who would have done such a thing... and why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7850;Look out below!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7854;Gravity can be a cruel mistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7855;I can't be blamed for building code violations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7860;My co-conspirators will bribe a hunter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7862;Very good. Send the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7865;I can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7866;Gghh... [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] got to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7867;W-why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7868;So you were paid by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7869;And you say you never saw the face of your employer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7870;They call it the wilds for a reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7874;To hunt a man is truly the greatest sport...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7875;I knew we couldn't trust him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7880;My co-conspirators will hire the mercenaries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7882;Excellent idea! The gold is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7885;Very well, but this had better not delay us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7886;I see. Disguised mercenaries working for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7887;Y-you're not highwaymen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7888;Only mercenaries in the employ of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] are so precise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7889;Too accurate for highwaymen. Only mercenaries are so precise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7890;Yes, the roads just aren't safe anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7894;Oh, those nasty bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7895;The plan looked good on paper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7900;My co-conspirators will bribe the driver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7902;The money will be sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7905;Excellent, we shall make good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7906;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] must have bribed him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7907;That rat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7908;Paid by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7909;And you don't know by whom? You will hang for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7910;Those things are deathtraps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7914;Shame on such a nice carriage, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7915;That spineless little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7950;My co-conspirators will bribe [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] servants to aid us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7955;That's right, do hurry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7956;Death to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7957;Why? Who? [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7958;Damn you, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7959;I fear I shall never know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7960;This is what decadence brings you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7963;Good. But... bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7964;I shall celebrate this... modestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7965;This is bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB7700;Hire bowmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7705;Did that come from the grassy knoll?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7720;Buy vast amounts of manure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB7950;I will bribe [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] servants to assist us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC8150;Seeing [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] with [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] nose deep in the cup, it suddenly struck me that all I need to get rid of [Root.PlotTarget.GetObjectPronoun] is a fine poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8151;Suddenly, it hit me - poison! Surely the safest way to get rid of troublesome... pests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8152;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to poison [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] at an upcoming banquet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8153;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to poison [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8154;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to fund the rare poison needed to off [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8155;What a merry feast, surrounded by my friends and loved ones... I feel a thirst coming on. Page, more wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8156;Poison! My body is growing numb, but as my sight fades, I die loudly cursing my killer's name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8157;Poison! My body is growing numb. Someone, please help me! [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8158;Poisoned wine? How cliché. These amateurs will be brought to justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8159;I could feel Death breathing down my neck... Who would want me dead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8160;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will die by poisoned wine at an upcoming banquet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8161;[From.GetTitledName] approves of my idea to poison [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8162;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will die by poisoned wine at a feast in one month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8163;Success! [From.GetTitledName] died of the poisoned wine. Unfortunately, my complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8164;Success! It seems the wine did not agree with [From.GetTitledName]. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] died not knowing the name of [From.GetPossPronoun] killer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8165;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] did not drink the wine and my complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8166;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] did not drink the wine, but was unable to uncover the conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8170;Seeing the cook's son fall from a tree, I had a flash of inspiration. Children are such foolish and clumsy creatures - how tragic if [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] were to fall off the parapets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8171;Ah, children, how they hurt themselves. How rare to see one without a bruise, a bump or a scab. Hmm, what if someone were to take a rather long fall?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8172;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to arrange a tragic falling accident for [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. Certain retainers need to be bribed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8173;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me enough money to bribe someone to give [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] a gentle push off the parapets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8174;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to give me the necessary bribes to have [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] fall off the parapets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8175;I love the thrill of heights, running on the castle walls and looking down at the little people below. If I reach out, maybe I can reach that bird's nest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8176;AAAH, someone pushed me! I'm falling! NOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8178;He was going to push me! I will find out who bribed him and why!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8179;Was that scullery maid going to push me off the wall? Who would want me dead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8180;Good news! My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon have a tragic fall off the castle parapets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8181;[From.GetTitledName] approves of my scheme to push [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] of a wall. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8182;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will soon fall off the castle walls. Such tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8183;Success! [From.GetTitledName] flew off those walls like an ostrich! Unfortunately, the assassin was caught and my complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8184;Success! It seems little [From.GetTitledName] had not yet learned how to fly. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] died a quick and presumably painless death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8185;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] dodged the assassin and ran off. My complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8186;Failure! The hired assassin did not get a chance to push [From.GetTitledName] off the walls, and will likely not get another. At least the plot remains unknown...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8200;Your shameful backing of a false Pope must end now. The Holy Father has agreed that the throne of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should pass to me so that the realm can be brought back into the true [From.Religion.GetName] fold.

EVTDESC8211;The weak Khan has agreed to our demands and have to surrender himself to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8212;A faction led by disgruntled Clan-Chiefs have ended without bloodshed as the previous Khan surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8213;I surrender myself to you [Root.GetTitledName] and only beg of you to have mercy upon me and my house...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8215;For too long, you have restricted the political influence of your vassals. The time has come to give the [Root.GetCouncilName] more power!

EVTDESC8226;The faction led by [From.GetBestName] won their war and have chosen me as successor to the title of [Root.GetTitle]. In the future I am expected to show generosity towards anyone who helped make this happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA8152;Very well - too bad I will not see it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8154;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8155;Aaah, that's the stuff!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8156;A million deaths for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8157;Who would hate me so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7500;My [Root.GetTitle], many of your faithful subjects, myself included, feel that [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has amassed more power and titles than is warranted by [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] station.

EVTDESC7501;We must confess to sharing in your concerns regarding the rising affluence of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. For the good of the realm, we shall contact [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] forthwith and seek the compromise you suggested.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7502;Don't be a fool, [Root.GetFirstName]! I will not see this realm torn asunder by intrigue and connivery. Abandon this scheme now, or on my oath you'll come to regret it!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7504;My dear [Root.GetTitle], we hope this letter finds you in good health. We have been urged by certain concerned parties to take steps in restoring the precarious balance of power in the realm, and we think it best if you voluntarily abdicate the [From.PlotTargetTitle] to one of your vassals. We are certain you will agree.\n\nSigned,\n[From.Liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7505;You have upset the delicate balance of power in the realm, [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. Relinquish control of the [From.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName] to one of your vassals for the good of all, lest my confederates and I accomplish the same through force of arms.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7506;Though I am sure I shall curse your name until the end of times, I will agree to your demand in the interest of peace.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7507;I would no sooner surrender the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName] than I would my right arm. If you and your little friends can muster the courage to face me, I shall gladly see you cut down to the last man. Come then!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7508;You put me in a difficult position, my liege, but if you feel this is the best course of action, then so be it. I shall surrender the title.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7509;I assume this is yet another poor attempt at humor, my liege. I shan't surrender that which is rightfully mine, no matter who demands it, by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7510;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has managed to arrange the abdication. [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] now rules the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7511;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] has refused the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s reasonable request to abdicate the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName], but at least this has given your liege the impetus to potentially revoke it in the future.

EVTDESC7515;Through the machinations of a secret conspiracy of noblemen, [From.GetTitledName] has been forced to abdicate one of [From.GetHerHis] duchies. After much deliberation, the lords of the realm have finally managed to agree on you as the least offensive candidate for the title. Congratulations, [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7517;[From.GetTitledName] had no eligible vassals to receive the title, so it has been granted to you instead to do with as you see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA7500;A commendable initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7504;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7505;I have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7507;You will choke on those words, my dear [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7508;Very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7509;The insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7511;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA7515;Good things come to those who wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB7500;I will have no part in this scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7504;Has he gone insane?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7505;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB7507;Perhaps I should not risk war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC7505;There are no eligible vassals, so you will have to take it yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x



EVTDESC7600;With the aid of your fellow conspirators, you have managed to fabricate a claim on the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7601;Not only have you failed to fabricate a claim on the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName], but your efforts have been discovered. [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is none too pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA7601;This will take some explaining...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x





EVTDESC7000;An unsigned letter arrives.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, a little bird has whispered in my ear that you have a $SPOUSE$ you wish would just...go away, and that you might be in need of assistance.

EVTDESC7005;Maybe riding alone through the woods wasn't such a good idea after all, as I now find myself surrounded by a band of brigands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7010;Today at lunchtime the [Root.GetMyChancellorName] suddenly burst through the door.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, something terrible has happened!

EVTDESC7015;This morning one of the chambermaids came rushing in.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, a terrible accident has occured! Your $SPOUSE$ was found at the bottom of the staircase with a broken neck! Obvoiusly $OPPOSITE_HE_SHE$ must have slipped...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7025;Waking up this morning, I found my $SPOUSE$ more cold than usual. I guess $OPPOSITE_HE_SHE$ must have been hiding some illness from me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7030;The sheriff suddenly burst through the door looking exited.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, I have splendid news! My men discovered a band of brigands hiding in the forest nearby. I'm glad to report we killed every last one of them!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7035;The cook of all people have thwarted my plans.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, my $HONORIFIC$! I found a man sneaking around the kitchen trying to poison the lunch I had prepared for your $SPOUSE$! Luckily I happened to catch him.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7065;Unfortunately I am writing to you with bad news. Our plan to assassinate your wife has met with failure. The man I trusted to carry out the attempt failed miserably.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFROM_CHARACTERNAME;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7070;My $HONORIFIC$, despite what you may have heard, I assure you that the moment just wasn't right for carrying out our plan against $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$.
