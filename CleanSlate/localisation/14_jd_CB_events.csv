evt_DESC_JD_2500;[tribute_war_suzerain.GetTitledFirstName] wishes to extort a flow of gold from the lands of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [tribute_war_suzerain.GetSheHeCap] is willing to send [tribute_war_suzerain.GetHerHis] soldiers to die for it. But am I as willing to send mine? I could surrender peacefully now and end this before my soldiers are potentially slaughtered, their families left to die and villages burnt to the ground... Or we fight to protect our land and drive back these [tribute_war_suzerain.Culture.GetName] invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_2501;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nLet us resolve this conflict peacefully. In exchange for putting a stop to this war and preventing bloodshed I shall agree to your demands and the lands of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will pay tribute to you. All I ask is that you promise safety for my people and send your soldiers home.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_2502;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYou have made a wise decision, I shall accept your offer and send my soldiers home in exchange for tribute from your lands.\n\nSigned\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_DESC_JD_2503;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYour offer is one of a coward, prepare your soldiers to meet in battle like a real warrior would.\n\nSigned\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTA_JD_2500;I shall end this before the blood of my people flows throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_2501;A wise decision! I shall accept [From.GetHerHis] proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_2502;We are safe... for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTA_JD_2503;I had a feeling it would come to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_OPTB_JD_2500;We must protect what is ours! We shall fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_OPTB_JD_2501;Look at the coward beg and plead! There will be no peace for [From.GetHerHim] that easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_2000;That [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetBestName] has declared war upon me with the presumed notion to free hostages I have rightfully captured! This gives me just cause to execute them, if I so wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2001;[From.GetBestName] has sent an envoy with an offer - if we were to end this war, [From.GetSheHe] will release all the captives and allow them safe passage to our court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2002;[From.GetBestName] has accepted our offer to release the captives, the war is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2003;[From.GetBestName] had the guts to deny our offer. Apparently, the lives of the captives do not mean anything to [From.GetHerHim] - it was all a ruse to declare war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2004;Disaster! In response to our declaration of war that [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetBestName] has beheaded [chosen_captive.GetFirstName]! We should have seen this coming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2005;In response to our declaration of war that [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetBestName] has has all captives beheaded! We should have seen this coming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2100;My heart burns with fervor upon hearing of the poor [Root.Religion.GetName] souls being oppressed in the realm of [liberate_target.GetBestName]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] intended for all true believers to be free to decide their own fate, but if [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is preoccupied with divine things perhaps I should carry out the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_2200;Our Tributary State of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has apparently decided to stop paying us tribute - [From.GetTitledFirstName] calls us "weak" and claims that we are "unable to defend [From.GetHerHis] realm", what nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JD_2000;This war must end, offer to send their people back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2001;Excellent! We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2002;It is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2003;The war goes on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2004;Oh, now it is personal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2005;This is a war of vengeance now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2100;I must liberate my [Root.Religion.GetName] brethren!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_2200;Perhaps it is time to make [From.GetHerHim] get back in line...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_JD_2000;I must make an example, execute [chosen_captive.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_2001;Ha! I am in this for the loot and plunder, the war is still on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_2003;Let us see if they mean little to [From.GetHerHim] when they are all dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JD_2100;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_JD_2000;How dare they? Execute ALL captives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_JD_2000;We shall meet on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
