EVTDESC_CM_501;The Avar Khaganate was established in Europe in 567 after the Avars had migrated into the Carpathian basin from the east. They crushed the Gepids and allied with the Lombards to form a strong realm in the area. For long periods they alternated between conflict and truce with the Eastern Roman Empire and had close dealings with the Lombard kings. Now, however, this once proud realm has fallen - the area is no longer ruled by an Avar dynasty and shall once again be known by the ancient name of Pannonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_502;The ancient Lombard Kingdom was established in Italy after a long history of migration originating in Northern Europe. Along the way, the Lombards themselves have changed, both influencing and becoming influenced by the regions they have settled. Now it has finally come to pass that the Lombard lands in Italy no longer have a Lombard ruler and this effectively spells the end of the name of the Kingdom of the Lombards. We shall henceforth speak of the Kingdom of Italy, but the Lombard heritage shall live on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_503;The centralization of power in Scandinavia, along with a rapid population expansion, has begun to drive its denizens to look beyond the home shores in earnest. New developments in shipbuilding, an adventurous spirit and a fearless belief in the Gods are now taking Norse seafarers across the seas towards distant lands. They arrive as traders, raiders and conquerors, and they call themselves 'Vikings'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_510;Since the fall of The Western Roman Empire in 476, the Emperor of Byzantium has been the sole claimant to the heritage of the Caesars. There has always been a rift between the Greek and Latin worlds, not least in matters of the Church. The Popes in Rome have for a long time made their own policies, refusing to accept Byzantine supremacy and denying that the Emperor in Constantinople would hold a legitimate claim to authority over Christendom.\n\n[From.GetDynName] has now been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by [From.RelHead.GetBestName], invoking the translatio imperii and restoring the Western Roman Empire. This perhaps signifies a new era in the history of Europe, and is definitely a confirmation of the longstanding rift between East and West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
