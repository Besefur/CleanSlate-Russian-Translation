EVTDESC_TOG_001;Brave Mongol warriors have poured through the Golden Gates of Kiev and sacked the once proud trading hub. The city has been left a smoldering ruin and the Dnieper now runs red with the blood of its former inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_002;Novgorod has been stormed by Mongol warriors and the city's inhabitants are now paying the ultimate price for their arrogance. The Cathedral of Saint Sophia is engulfed in flames as the warriors loot that which can be carried away and put the rest to the torch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_003;Mongol armies continue to push beyond the Vistula and into Poland. Krakow has now fallen to the skilled warriors, and it is said that at night the flames from the burning city can be seen from untold leagues away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_004;Even Aachen, the former seat of Charlemagne's Carolingian empire, has fallen under the shadow of the great Mongol nation. His spirit must surely be weeping at the harsh punishment now being brought down on the decadent peasants within the city's walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_005;Like a swarm of locusts, the unstoppable Mongols have descended upon Paris and sacked the city. The still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral is quickly set on fire and with the light provided by the rest of the burning city, the Mongol warriors can continue looting and murdering well into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_006;Not even the sea has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt the Mongol advance. London has fallen to the Mongol vanguard and the city is now the scene of a slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_007;As is proper, Rome once more suffers at the just hands of warriors from the east. A Mongol army has breached the Aurelian Walls, and its horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while the ranking officers raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill. As expected, no mercy is shown to those foolish Romans who have not yet fled the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_008;The canals of Venice have been blocked by the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by frenzied Mongol warriors. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter claim the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for the Mongols to ride to and from the mainland as they please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_009;The Theodosian Walls have not been enough to spare Constantinople from the deadly touch of the Mongol nation. The great imperial capital has been sacked, its citizens butchered or enslaved, the Hagia Sophia defiled and the Great Palace of the emperors put to the torch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_010;Our armies have now reached as far west as Lisbon in the quest to conquer the world for the great Mongol nation. While the city burns at the touch of our warriors, they look out over the great blue expanse of the Atlantic. Who can tell what lies beyond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_011;Smolensk has been swallowed up by the Mongol horde as it continues its relentless advance to the west. When the great host finally moves on, little remains of the city but ashes and charred rubble, and those lucky few inhabitants who somehow escaped the notice of the rampaging horsemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_012;The city of Prague has indeed become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as Mongol warriors move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted. A flood of refugees spread horrific tales about the cruelty and skill of the bloodthirsty Tartar horsemen to every corner of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_013;Vienna, a city previously of growing importance on the Danube river, has become the latest target of the great Mongol armies as they continue to pillage and burn their way across Europe. The smoking ruins and arrow-riddled corpses they leave behind when they move on do not lend much faith in the city's future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_014;The great Mongol horde has reached beyond the Carpathians and fanned out across the Great Hungarian Plain. Now the city of Esztergom has fallen to the murderous host and is the scene of indiscriminate slaughter. Those that attempt to flee on foot are cut down without mercy by the fast horsemen as dark, billowing smoke rises towards the sky above the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_015;The ancient city of Athens has fallen to the Mongols, and they now rampage unchecked behind its walls. Great monuments and artifacts dating back to the dawn of Western Civilisation are lost forever in a cultural desecration that will surely be felt by future generations thousands of years from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_016;The White City has turned red as the Mongol armies seize Belgrade and massacre the inhabitants without exception. After several days of slaughter and looting, the smell of death and rotting flesh proves too much even for our warriors to bear and they move their camp upwind from the scorched ruins of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_017;The decadent city of Baghdad, supposedly one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the unstoppable Mongol armies after a siege. Now the Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_018;Damascus, the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by the advancing Mongols. Our warriors have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed burj al-ru'us by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_019;The great Mongol host has sacked Jerusalem, spurring a moment of rare solidarity between members of all the city's different religions as they suffer equal horrors under the righteous wrath of our warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_020;Not content with our vast empire surpassing Alexander the Great's in sheer size, Mongol armies are now laying waste to the city that is his namesake as well. Pompey's Pillar has been toppled, but sadly the Pharos Lighthouse is spared when the our warriors deem it not worth the great effort it would require to raze it to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_021;Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, a Mongol army has arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of Cairo. Surely even the cruelest Pharaoh would be given pause by the pain and misery now inflicted on the city's decadent and foolish population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_022;The Muslim Holy City of Mecca now burns at the hands of Mongol warriors. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This desecration will be remembered for ages to come, hopefully as an important lesson on the price of defying the powerful Mongol nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_100;You have sent out the call for the Nerge to your vassals. Preparations for the Great Hunt have begun, and your scouts have chosen a promising region that is rich with game. Mongol warriors are converging on the designated assembly points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_101;The great [From.GetTitle] has announced the beginning of the Nerge! This Great Hunt, which will last for several months, is nothing less than a massive training exercise where all arms of the Mongol army come together and are molded into a lethal fighting force. Your presence is required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_102;The preparations for the Nerge have been completed, and your forces are deployed at the assembly points! They will now advance in formation, driving all wildlife before them until they are trapped and surrounded in a large clearing prepared by your scouts. Then the killing begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_103;The preparations for the Nerge have been completed, and the [From.GetTitle]'s  forces are deployed at the assembly points! Together, you will now advance in formation, driving all wildlife before you until they are trapped and surrounded in a large clearing prepared by the [From.GetTitle]'s scouts. Then the killing begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_110;While guiding the advance in your assigned sector of the Nerge, your horse was suddenly startled by a fox bolting from its hiding place. You were thrown off your saddle, and when you regained consciousness you found your arm painfully twisted at a strange angle. It looks like this hunt is over for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_111;While guiding the advance in his assigned sector of the Nerge, [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s horse was suddenly startled by a fox bolting from its hiding place. He was thrown off his saddle and broke his arm. For him, the hunt is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_112;Your forces continue to drive wildlife before them, but as they pass a small creek, their lines collide with forces under [quarreling_vassal.GetTitledFirstName]'s command! The cohesion of your forces has been broken, and when [quarreling_vassal.GetFirstName] chastises you in front of your men, you come to blows with the man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_113;Word has reached you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] came to blows with [quarreling_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] in front of their men, when their advancing lines became entangled in one another. No wildlife seems to have escaped, and the matter has been settled between the men. They will likely hold a grudge, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_114;You have failed to keep the advance of your men orderly, and as a result gaps have opened up in your lines. It's impossible to tell how much wildlife has escaped the encirclement, but some is bound to have slipped through the cracks. When the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] learns of this, [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] will not be pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_115;Through incompetence, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has failed to properly maintain his lines resulting in a large gap forming in the encirclement. Much wildlife has escaped, and tradition dictates that [From.GetFirstName] and his men be punished severely. Failure to do so could disrupt discipline among the other troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_116;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle], in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] wisdom, has decided to punish you and your men for your failure to maintain formation. Your life shall be spared, but you will be severely clubbed as a lesson to all. Unit cohesion must be maintained at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_117;As you advance together with your men in the Nerge, you suddenly spot a large and magnificent buck standing in a small clearing. Without thinking you raise your bow and fire an arrow. You score a direct hit and the animal falls to the ground, but you are in trouble now – no animals may be killed at this stage in the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_118;While advancing with his forces, [From.GetTitledFirstName] felled a buck with his bow. This is unacceptable – per ancient tradition, no animals may be killed during the Nerge before the encirclement has been completed. A harsh punishment for this transgression will be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_150;The horde of frantic animals has been corralled into a clearing and they are now completely surrounded by your forces. As the [Root.GetTitle], you and your closest retinue will be given the first opportunity to engage in the killing sport. Only after you are finished will your vassals be allowed to hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_151;The horde of frantic animals has been corralled into a clearing and they are now completely surrounded by the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s forces. As is [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] right, the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] and [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] closest retinue will start the killing. When [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is finished, it will be your turn along with the other vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_152;You spend a few hours hunting the trapped game, and it soon becomes obvious to everyone that you have a real knack for this. The arrows from your bow easily find their marks, and you seem better able than most in predicting the behavior of the animals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_158;One of your warriors has demonstrated exceptional skill during the Nerge, both in sheer martial ability and in the art of effectively commanding a large body of men. He is brought before his [Root.GetTitle], and your advisors suggest that you consider elevating him into a position in your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_159;As a gift, one of your warriors participating in the Great Hunt has offered you an exceptional bear cub that he managed to tie up and capturing while advancing with the rest of your forces. The animal's fur is white and its eyes are a deep red – it seems to be an albino.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_160;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [bear_victim.GetTitledFirstName] lying wounded on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [bear_victim.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_161;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [bear_victim.GetTitledFirstName] lying maimed on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [bear_victim.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_162;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [bear_victim.GetTitledFirstName] lying dead on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [bear_victim.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_163;Some visiting foreign dignitaries who have come to offer tribute to you, the great [Root.GetTitle], have become very impressed with your pet albino bear. They claim never to have seen such a magnificent beast, and that you must be a powerful leader indeed to have enslaved it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_164;Some travelers from faraway Hindustan have offered to teach your pet bear to dance, and you have accepted their offer. After spending many months at your court, they have succeeded and you have become renowned throughout the world as the mighty [Root.GetTitle] with the dancing white bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_165;Your pet albino bear does not seem to be feeling well. It refuses to eat, and its handlers are at a loss to explain what might be wrong with it. Could it be that the proud animal has grown tired of its chains and yearns to be free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_166;Sadly, you discovered this morning that your pet albino bear has passed away. The poor animal will get a proper funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_169;As per tradition, some of your older soldiers have come before you to plead for the life of those few animals that remain in the encircled clearing. Their release, as a display of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, usually signals the end of the Nerge, and the beginning of nine days of feasting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_170;With the hunt over and the fallen game collected, a magnificent feast has been prepared for all who took part. The next nine days will be ones of drunken revelry and celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_180;With the feasting over, the remaining spoils of the hunt are divided evenly between all of the forces that participated. As everyone departs, you survey the surrounding land. It will be some time before the wildlife in this region recovers from this slaughter, but when that happens, the time will be ripe for another Great Hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_181;With the present war, the Great Hunt has been called off and you and your men will have to get your training hunting the most dangerous game of all – Man. Perhaps when the dust has settled and peace returned, a new Nerge can be organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_001;They shall never forget our might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_100;Soon we shall see the mettle of these warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_101;As my [From.GetTitle] commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_102;Let the hunt commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_110;What rotten luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_111;More game for the rest of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_112;That arrogant fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_113;They need to focus on their duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_114;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_115;The fool will pay for his mistakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_116;Let's get this over with then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_117;Oops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_118;Punish the fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_150;Hand me my bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_151;At last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_152;These furs will warm me in the cold winter months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_158;Yes, make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_159;Thank you for this gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_160;Now where was I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_163;It is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_164;I... I can't stop... dancing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_165;Release the bear back into the wilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_166;A dark day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_169;Yes. As is tradition, these animals shall not be harmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_170;Let us drink and be merry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_180;May it go as well as this one did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_181;A different breed of hunt, but a hunt all the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_115;I will show leniency this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_118;A reprimand will be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_158;No, he belongs with the other soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_159;Rid me of this abomination!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_165;Nonsense. It's better off here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_169;No, kill them all! No survivors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_101;The call for the Great Hunt goes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_116;A severe clubbing is administered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
