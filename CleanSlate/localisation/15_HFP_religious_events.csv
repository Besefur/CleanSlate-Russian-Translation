EVTDESCAHFP23001;As [From.GetFirstName] is dragged away from the main hall yelling and cursing, [From.GetSheHe] swears that [From.GetSheHe] will one day return to enact [From.GetHerHis] vengeance and take what [From.GetSheHe] considers to be [From.GetHerHis] birthright by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23004;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have taken note of your passionate plea for forgiveness, and We are certain that you will be eager to prove the sincerity of your repentance by paying the proper price for your indulgence.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23005;After paying the requested tribute to the Holy See, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has finally agreed to lift my Excommunication and welcome me back into the loving embrace of the Holy Mother Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23006;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have heard your passionate plea for forgiveness, and We are certain that you will be eager to prove the sincerity of your repentance by with a public act of contrition in Our presence.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23007;I am forced to spend three days in the mud, with my head covered in ash, dragging myself towards the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s holy palace before [FromFrom.GetFirstName] finally decides to grant me [FromFrom.GetHerHis] forgiveness, lifting my Excommunication and welcoming me back into the loving embrace of the Holy Mother Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23008;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have heard your passionate plea for forgiveness, and We are certain that you will be eager to prove the sincerity of your repentance by devoting yourself to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName], taking a vow of celibacy.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23009;The [FromFrom.GetTitle] has requested that I prove my contrition for past sins by taking a strict vow of celibacy, claiming that my libertine attitude is what caused me to stray away from virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23011;The [FromFrom.GetTitle] has determined that the price for my wickedness is the life of my [son_monk_candidate.GetSonDaughter] [son_monk_candidate.GetFirstName]. [son_monk_candidate.GetSheHeCap] will take [son_monk_candidate.GetHerHis] leave [Root.Capital.GetName] to become a [son_monk_candidate.GetManWoman] of the cloth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23012;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nWe fear that your infractions are far too severe to be forgiven by a simple act of contrition. If you care for the salvation of your soul, you will relinquish your throne, which your wicked deeds have irredeemably soiled, and devote yourself to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23013;I never realized it would come to this until it was too late. To cleanse my sins I have to abdicate my own throne. Stripped of all my titles, I will have to live a life of deprivation, cloistered in a monastery, far from all my friends and relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHFP23016;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nWe are of the opinion that it was your hubris and selfish thirst for power that have led you on the path of wickedness. As such, we demand that, in exchange for your absolution, you show your humility by equally dividing your realm amongst your heirs.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23017;It is decree of the Holy See that my titles be split upon my death equally amongst my children. The very integrity of my realm is a steep price to pay to receive absolution for my past sins and be able to rejoin my fellow [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23019;With the restoration of the Papal State's ancient borders, the Pope has finally seen fit to absolve me from my past sins and lift the Excommunication that [From.GetSheHe] had placed upon me. I can now rejoin the Holy Mother Church in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23021;In order to receive absolution from my sins, I am required to recognize the authority that the Holy See has over me in the first place. As such, I was forced to relinquish [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] from my control, granting [FromFrom.GetHerHim] full power over [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP23023;The Holy See claims direct dominion over all of Italy since the Donation of Emperor Pepin. Although [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] had gained independence in recent times, I am now forced to bow to the throne of Saint Peter in order to find absolution for my transgression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHFP23001;Breaking the news to [From.GetFirstName] is not easy.
