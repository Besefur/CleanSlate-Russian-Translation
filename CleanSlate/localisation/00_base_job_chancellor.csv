# Attempt to improve relations with lord
evt_chancellor_001_title;Improved Relations with Lord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_001_desc_a;During my stay at the court of a noble in [Root.Location.GetName], I have done my utmost to present my liege in a more favourable light and have him recognized as the benevolent and peaceful ruler [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_001_option_a;It seems as if I have succeeded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Inform the noble
evt_chancellor_002_desc_a;During [From.GetHerHis] visit to my court, the [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Host.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [From.GetTitledName], has really convinced me of what a benevolent and peaceful ruler [From.GetHerHis] liege [From.Host.GetTitledName] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_002_option_a;I feel a new appreciation for [From.Host.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege is informed of the success
evt_chancellor_003_desc_a;My liege, my mission to [FromFrom.Location.GetName] has so far been a success! During my visit to the court of [From.GetBestName], I seem to have managed to make [From.GetHerHim] understand what a benevolent and peaceful ruler you really are and [From.GetSheHe] sends [From.GetHerHis] regards.\n\nYour humble [Root.GetChancellorName],\n[Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Attempt to improve relations is sabotaged
evt_chancellor_101_title;Sabotaged Relations with Lord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_101_desc_a;During my stay at the court of a noble in [Root.Location.GetName], I have done my utmost to present my liege in a more favourable light. But sinister forces around me seem to conspire to twist and turn my every action into something dubious and every word spoken into an insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_101_option_a;It seems I have failed miserably...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_102_desc_a;During [From.GetHerHis] visit to my court, the [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Host.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [From.GetTitledName], has been going on and on about what a benevolent and peaceful ruler [From.GetHerHis] liege [From.Host.GetTitledName] is. But other members of the court have informed me of what a shameless and deceitful liar both [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] liege are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_102_desc_b;During [From.GetHerHis] visit to my court, the [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Host.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [From.GetTitledName], has been going on and on about what a benevolent and peaceful ruler our liege [From.Host.GetTitledName] is. But other members of the court have informed me of what a shameless and deceitful liar both [From.GetSheHe] and our liege are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_102_option_a;This certainly won't increase my opinion of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_103_desc_a;My liege, I have tried to make [From.GetBestName] realize what a benevolent and peaceful ruler you really are, but sinister forces at [From.GetHerHis] court have been hard at work to discredit my every move and distort my every word. I am afraid that in the end the visit seems to have done more harm than good.\n\nYour humble [Root.GetChancellorName],\n[Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_103_option_a;Harm indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Chancellor fabricates a claim
evt_chancellor_201_title;Claim Fabricated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_201_desc_a;According to my liege's order, I have done my best to fabricate a claim on the title of a local landed noble in [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_201_option_a;This better work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The noble is informed about the claim
evt_chancellor_202_desc_a;It has come to my attention that the [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Host.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [From.GetTitledName], has bribed and threatened [From.GetHerHis] way through my domain trying to get enough people to recognize a claim on my title that [From.GetSheHe] has fabricated for [From.GetHerHis] liege, [From.Liege.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_202_option_a;They better not use it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Unused
EVTTOOLTIP20131;Send a letter to my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege is informed and has a choice to press the claim or not
evt_chancellor_203_desc_a;My liege, my work in [FromFrom.Location.GetName] seems to have come to fruition. By bribing, cajoling, extorting, threatening and forging documents, I have managed to fabricate a claim on the [FromFrom.Location.County.GetFullName] presently held by [From.GetTitledName]. I leave it up to you whether to use it or not.\n\nYour humble [Root.GetChancellorName],\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_203_option_a;Use it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_203_option_b;Let it go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The noble is informed if the claim is pressed, and is insulted
evt_chancellor_204_desc_a;[From.GetFullName] has decided to go ahead and use a claim on my title despite having nothing more than a laughable and obviously fabricated document to back it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_204_option_a;That bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# A Noble finds out that the Chancellor is trying to fabricate claims
evt_chancellor_301_title;Noble Infuriated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_301_desc_a;A local noble in [Root.Location.GetName] became suspicious after I asked a couple of brash questions and I fear he might have figured out that I am trying to fabricate a claim to his title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_301_option_a;I got a little careless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_301_option_a_tooltip;The noble knows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The noble knows about the fabricated claims
evt_chancellor_302_desc_a;[From.Host.GetTitledName] is trying to usurp my title! [From.Host.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledName] is supposedly traveling around [From.Location.GetName] trying to find both documents and supporters to help him legitimize a claim on the title. I need to do something about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_302_option_a;Make him disappear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_302_option_a_tooltip_1;An attempt on [This.GetHerHis] life is made;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_302_option_a_tooltip_2;The assassination attempt fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_302_option_b_tooltip;Send him an offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_302_option_c;I better let it be for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Chancellor is assassinated...
evt_chancellor_303_desc_a;The attempt to fabricate a claim on a title held by [From.GetTitledName] did not pass unnoticed, and rumors say that [From.GetSheHe] was so angry that [From.GetSheHe] ordered to have me assassinated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_303_option_a;I am not too worried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble is informed that the assassination attempt succeeded
evt_chancellor_304_desc_a;The assassins succeeded! The troublesome [Root.GetChancellorName] who was roaming around the county trying to fabricate a claim on my title is no more... And there is no trace leading back to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege is informed about the Chancellor's death
evt_chancellor_305_desc_a;During a mission to try and fabricate a claim to a title in [From.Location.GetName], my [Root.GetChancellorName] has been murdered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_306_desc_a;The assassins I sent failed miserably and the troublesome [FromFrom.GetMyChancellorName], [FromFrom.GetTitledName], continues his work to fabricate a claim on my title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_306_option_a;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble tries to bribe Chancellor
evt_chancellor_307_desc_a;It has come to my attention that your work in [Root.Location.GetName] is aimed to fabricate a claim on my title. This is of course unacceptable but I am willing to offer you a small contribution to encourage you to 'forget' about this for some time.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_307_option_a;I guess that could be arranged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_307_option_b;I would never betray my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_307_option_b_tooltip;Send the money back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble is informed that the Chancellor accepted the bribe
evt_chancellor_308_desc_a;I have decided to accept your generous offer, and you can rest assure that I won't find anything that can be used to fabricate a claim within the next year...\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Noble is informed that the Chancellor didn't accept the bribe
evt_chancellor_309_desc_a;Your shameful attempt to bribe me has not been able to make the slightest dent in my moral armor and I am sending back the money. No matter the amount of gold, I could never be persuaded to betray my liege!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_309_option_a;Damn him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# The Chancellor sows dissent between a local noble and his liege
evt_chancellor_401_title;Vassal-Liege Opinion Lowered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_401_desc_a;It took all my skill and charm to sow distrust between a noble in [Root.Location.GetName] and his liege, but at last their relations lay in ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_401_option_a;This should please my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The local noble start disliking his liege
evt_chancellor_402_desc_a;At first I could not believe it, but [From.GetTitledName] persisted and showed irrefutable evidence that my own liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] distrust and despises me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_402_option_a;What an insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_402_option_a_tooltip;Send an angry letter to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege of the local noble is informed
evt_chancellor_403_desc_a;[From.GetTitledName] accused me of distrusting him and claimed to have evidence of my betrayal! I don't know where he have gotten these ideas from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_chancellor_403_option_a;What an idiot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# The liege of the Chancellor is informed
evt_chancellor_404_desc_a;My liege, I have managed to sow distrust between [From.GetTitledName] and [From.GetHerHis] liege [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. I hope this pleases you.\n\nYour humble [Root.GetMyChancellorName],\n[Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_chancellor_501_desc_a;I have been sent to [From.Location.GetName] to secretly create unrest between the local nobles and their liege, but it seems that at least one of them has seen my real motive and I fear he might inform his liege about this, or even imprison me!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
