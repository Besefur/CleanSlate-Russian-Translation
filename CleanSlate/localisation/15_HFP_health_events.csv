EVTDESCAHFP20606;As I demand the servants to bring me another course of delicious red meat, my eyes fall down on my distended belly, placidly resting over my lap. My love of food is not having a positive effect on my health: if I do not do something about it, I may soon be in need of a wider throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20608;I let out a loud burp and sit back on my chair, letting out a chuckle when I realize my belly has started to stick out of my clothes. Eating so much may not be what is best for my body, but it has certainly improved my mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20613;I may not be the fastest rider or the quickest warrior, but I am certainly the best husband any woman could desire, and the kindest patriarch any dynasty could wish for. All my close relatives know it and love me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20614;[From.GetFirstName] is such a caring [GetFromRelation], always ready to lighten up the mood during a somber family dinner or play with the children. Even though we may disagree from time to time, I cannot deny [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments as [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20616;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has really been letting [From.GetHerselfHimself] go as of late. What was once a strong and energetic [From.GetManWoman] has slowly become a weak-willed and sedentary glutton, only excited about [From.GetHerHis] next great feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20618;Today [From.GetFirstName] took me aside for a minute for a private talk. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is concerned about my growing weight and fears that if I do not change my dietary habits I may be jeopardizing my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20629;This morning one of my servants caught me just in time to stop me from falling senseless on the ground. At first I thought nothing of it, but, after a good night to think about the curious episode, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps all these years spent abstaining from all but the simplest foods are starting to take a toll on my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20632;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been reduced in such a miserable state, laying every day in [From.GetHerHis] bed, starved and sobbing, that it has become really hard for anybody to go against the few wishes [From.GetSheHe] has left in [From.GetHerHis] skeletal body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20638;Cutting on sleeping and eating times has really helped me getting ahead of my tasks. I may be looking ghastly, but I feel much better now that everything has been nicely fit into my schedule. As long as I keep skipping dinner and only sleep twice a week, I can fulfill all my responsibilities with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20642;[From.GetFirstName] came in my room this morning to speak with me of [From.GetHerHis] growing concern for my health. [From.GetSheHeCap] believes that all this fasting might be putting me under serious risk and encouraged me to try and eat more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20647;Whenever I walk through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], I can hear the sound of snickering behind my back. My tribesmen do not respect me, and who could blame them? I have grown so fat that even the most menial task makes me sweat and pant. How can I be the [Root.GetTitle] of anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20648;Whenever I walk through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], I can hear the sound of snickering behind my back. My tribesmen do not respect me, and who could blame them? I have grown so thin and pale that even the most menial task makes me cringe and faint. How can I be the [Root.GetTitle] of anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20650;I am a bit concerned by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Eating so much as [From.GetSheHe] does might not be good for [From.GetHerHis] health. Just today I saw [From.GetHerHim] struggling simply to get on [From.GetHerHis] horse. The beast didn't look too well after the ride either...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20651;I simply cannot bear the sight of my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], what with [From.GetHerHis] perfect body and happy life. After seeing how much [From.GetSheHe] cares about keeping a balanced diet and a healthy body, I started to wonder if I couldn't ruin [From.GetHerHim] with just a few well-placed words...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20653;Today I was approached by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] is concerned about my health and thinks that I am becoming too frail and thin. If I keep eating so little, [From.GetSheHe] says, I will soon no longer be able to wield a sword, pleasure a woman, or even just go out riding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20659;My advice fell on deaf ears: my [GetFromRelation] does not wishes to change [From.GetHerHis] frugal diet, even after I warned [From.GetHerHim] of the risks [From.GetSheHe] is exposing [From.GetHerselfHimself] to because [From.GetHerHis] stubbornness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20660;My advice fell on deaf ears: my [GetFromRelation] does not wishes to put [From.GetHerselfHimself] on a stricter diet, even after I warned [From.GetHerHim] of the risks [From.GetSheHe] is exposing [From.GetHerselfHimself] to because of [From.GetHerHis] gluttony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20661;All these years spent indulging my gluttony have finally caught up with me: my body has grown so bloated and flabby that I can no longer stand without help. I spend my days laying on my bed, looking at the line of servants going back and forth from the kitchen, carrying more delicacies to fill my insatiable appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20662;All these years spent starving myself have finally caught up with me: my stomach has closed almost entirely, so much so that I need servants slowly feeding me small spoonfuls of soup in order to eat anything. I have become too weak to stand without help, and the even mere act of thinking has become a laborious task for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20663;I place my fists on my side and smirk at my reflection. I am looking quite impressive as of late. A strong and powerful [Root.GetTitle] such as myself should look the part. I am the biggest man in [Root.Capital.GetName] and I wouldn't want to have it any other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20664;I take a deep breath and wait for the servants to try and push me on my horse for the third time. After a bit of struggling, the five boys manage to get me over the poor beast and I am finally ready to go. This extra weight of mine might give me trouble from time to time, but it has surely taught me the virtue of patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20665;What else can a man pretend from life beside a full stomach? I loosen up my belt and let out a long sigh, letting my eyes go over the line of dishes still waiting for me on the table. Here in my [Root.GetHouse] I am happy, warm, and pampered. There is nowhere else I'd rather be, nothing else I'd rather be doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20666;So often rulers such as myself have fallen prey to temptation, surrounded themselves with the excesses granted by our station and subsequently forgot their duties. My deprivations, on the other hand, have allowed me to remain in touch with the struggles of even the poorest of my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20667;Every day I look around I hear young men riding by my window, laughing and teasing each other, while my frail constitution forces me to remain confined to my rooms. I hate them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20668;They think themselves so clever, the little rats. They all think they can poison my food, stalk in my bedroom at night and that I won't see them. They all think their pitiful pleas for mercy will save them. But they are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20669;All these years spent stuffing my belly with sweets have turned me in a sturdy young man. I didn't mind being the biggest amongst my playmates when I was younger, but now I am starting to long for a slimmer, more agile body...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20670;It wasn't easy, but thanks to my determination and countless hours spent running and training outside have helped me shed all the excess weight I was carrying around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20671;It wasn't easy, but thanks to my determination and countless hours spent running and training outside have turned me into an energetic, strong [Root.GetManWoman]. I cannot recall the last time I felt so well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20672;It wasn't easy, but all these days of self-imposed fasting have finally paid off: I have shed off all my excess weight and become a nimble [Root.GetManWoman]. I feel a bit weaker now, but that's a small price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20673;It wasn't easy, but all these days of self-imposed fasting have finally paid off: I have shed off all my excess weight and become a nimble [Root.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20674;It wasn't easy, but I have finally managed to overcome my weakly disposition. No longer the nimble, sickly boy I was before, I have now become a big, strong man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20675;It wasn't easy, but I have finally managed to overcome my weakly disposition. I tire less often, and I feel a lot stronger and a lot better than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20676;Studying my liege's frail condition has brought me to believe that [From.GetHerHis] lack of appetite and sleep may be caused by a severe unbalance of [From.GetHerHis] humors. Operating periodic leeching sessions on [From.GetHerHim] might be what [From.GetSheHe] needs in order to get back in shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20677;My Physician has informed me that periodic leeching might be what I need to restore my appetite and facilitate my sleep at night. Perhaps I should try this treatment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20678;All this bloodletting might not have helped me get back in strength, but it is undoubtedly affecting my humoral balance. While I see some things more clearly, I feel like I am growing colder and more detached towards the world around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20679;The guards drag me to the feet of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed. My liege coldly explains to me in a whisper that, while [From.GetSheHe] feels that the bloodlettings helped [From.GetHerHim] gain a new perspective on the nature of life, [From.GetSheHe] doubts that my intentions for starting the treatment were as pure as I claimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20680;It has occurred to me since some time that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started treating me with a peculiar care compared to my other vassals. Just today [From.GetSheHe] decided to openly state that [From.GetSheHe] feels duty-bound to protect me from any harm that may come to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20681;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was touched by my concern, but [From.GetSheHe] decided to politely decline my offer of assistance, assuring me that [From.GetSheHe] is perfectly capable of handling [From.GetHerselfHimself] and that it would be immodest for me to be so close to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20682;My spouse [FromFrom.GetFirstName] spends too much time with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has developed an unhealthy relationship with that [From.GetManWoman], listening to [From.GetHerHis] every command. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly taking advantage of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] good nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20683;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has caught wind of [From.GetHerHis] spouse's obsession with me and demanded that I relinquish [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] from the unhealthy hold I am keeping [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] under. Unfortunately, I have grown rather accustomed to [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] doing everything for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20684;The unthinkable has happened. My wife, growing jealous of the preferential treatment I was giving to my liege, has openly demanded [From.GetTitledFirstName] to distance [From.GetHerselfHimself] from me. [From.GetFirstName] ordered me to kill [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to prove my loyalty to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20685;Only as [From.GetFirstName]'s blade sinks into my stomach I finally realize how deep my husband obsession was running...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20686;The unthinkable has happened. My wife, growing jealous of the preferential treatment I was giving to my liege, has openly demanded [From.GetTitledFirstName] to distance [From.GetHerselfHimself] from me. [From.GetFirstName] ordered me to repudiate [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to prove my loyalty to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20687;I cannot believe it! My husband decided to turn against me for [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s sake! [From.GetSheHeCap] refuses to sleep or even talk to me anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20688;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has stopped speaking with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] wife, just like I ordered. I never realized I could exploit my weakened condition to manipulate people to such an extent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20689;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has permanently silenced [FromFrom.GetHerHis] wife, just like I ordered. I never realized I could exploit my weakened condition to manipulate people to such an extent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20690;Whatever [From.GetFirstName]'s plans were, [From.GetSheHe] will no longer be able to enact them. Yet, I have found that I do not wish to interrupt [From.GetHerHis] treatment. The clarity of mind and purity of intent given to me thanks to these bloodlettings have made me a much more effective [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20691;I look at the tumid leeches over my arm, feeling the bad blood being sucked out of me. My body may be weak, but I have never achieved such clarity of mind before. So many of the worries and attachments that bothered me in the past have now become inconsequential, and I am free to act however necessary to achieve my goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20692;It has just come to my attention that one of the bards under my patronage has just written a not too flattering song mocking [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s wide girth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20693;Tonight a new bard performed at [Root.Capital.GetName]. His songs were quite catchy, until I realized that in many of them the man was using clever metaphors to make fun of my weight, comparing me to a ravenous boar constantly eating roasted pigs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20694;I was right not to worry. My bard played his piece and [From.GetTitledFirstName] laughed just as much as everybody else, although I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] understood the real meaning behind the bard's metaphors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20695;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the patron of the bard that entertained my court last night, took some time to apologize for the inappropriate nature of the songs this morning. [From.GetSheHeCap] was extremely relieved and happy when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I was well aware of the songs' meaning and that I enjoyed the performance regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20696;What I feared has happened: the bard's song greatly angered [From.GetTitledFirstName], to the point that my liege had the bard flogged and thrown out of court without much ceremony. Unfortunately, this morning I have heard news that the man has not even learned his lesson: he is going around the countryside, still performing his shameful pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20697;My equity was not appreciated, it seems. The bard was flogged and exiled from court, as he should have been, yet now he still persist in his irreverent behavior. I have heard news that he is wandering through the countryside, telling even more unflattering songs about me to everyone he meets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20698;The unthinkable has happened: [From.GetTitledFirstName] was so furious of the bard's song that [From.GetSheHe] had the man roasted on the spot as punishment. I never imagined my liege could be such a cruel and ruthless [From.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20699;As the smoking carcass of the bard is brought back to the main hall, nobody is laughing anymore. Perhaps now my subjects will understand the proper respect that is due to their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20700;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is such a frail and gentle creature. Even the simplest actions are hard for her to perform. The more I see [From.GetHerHim], the more I am convinced that it is my duty as [From.GetHerHis] vassal to protect [From.GetHerHim] from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20701;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled to test my treatment. We immediately operated the first of many bloodlettings to come, and I am hopeful that, through this process, my liege will soon find [From.GetHerHis] balance once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20702;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in my proposal. I can do nothing else to help [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHFP20703;While [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s appetite is yet to return, the leeching seems to have stabilized [From.GetHerHis] condition. Some malicious courtiers have spread the rumor that the constant bloodletting is sucking away all humanity from my patient, but I doubt any of it is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHFP20606;The servant girls chuckle as I pass by them on my way to the dining room. I catch only a few of their words before they hastily go back to their tasks, but it is clear that the source of their odious giggling is my wide, puffy hips. All of these large feasts I subject myself to have really started to ruin my figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20608;As I look down on my next course, I notice that a few crumbs from my past meal are still scattered over my ample bosom, so I quickly brush them away with a giggle. Eating so much may not be what is best for my body, but it has certainly improved my mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20613;I may have lost the graceful and slim figure I had during my youth, but my devotion to my duties as a mother has earned me the love and respect of all my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20616;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been really letting [From.GetHerselfHimself] go as of late. What was once a graceful and delicate [From.GetManWoman] has slowly become an undignified and hefty glutton, only excited about [From.GetHerHis] next great feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20618;Outrageous! [From.GetFirstName] just told me that if I don't stop eating I will soon no longer be even be able to stand, let alone accomplish anything of note.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20629;This morning I was found laying on the ground in my garden. I cannot recall exactly what happened, but the servants insist that I fainted while taking a walk. Perhaps all these years spent abstaining from all but the simplest foods are starting to take a toll on my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20638;I gaze once more into my mirror, giving a satisfied smirk to my reflection. It has not been easy resisting all temptations, but now I have finally gained the sort of slim, graceful figure that most ladies can only dream of. With not a single ounce of fat left on my body, I am surely going to be the envy of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20642;The gall on my [GetFromRelation]! [From.GetSheHeCap] barged into my room this morning, telling me that I better start eating more before I starve myself to death, as if [From.GetSheHe] has any business meddling with my private life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20647;Whenever I am carried around [Root.Capital.GetName] on my litter, I receive no shortage of envious gazes from the starving tribeswomen working in the streets. They all envy my pampered lifestyle, but little do they of what it has cost me. I have grown so fat and bloated that even breathing is turning into a challenge for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20648;Whenever I am carried around [Root.Capital.GetName] on my litter, I receive no shortage of envious gazes from the other tribeswomen. They all envy my pampered lifestyle, but little do they know of what it has cost me. I have grown so frail and sickly that I can barely stand without assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20650;I am a bit concerned by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Eating so much as [From.GetSheHe] does might not be good for [From.GetHerHis] health. [From.GetSheHeCap] has started to grow a potbelly and [From.GetSheHe] does not look too far from gaining another chin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20653;Today I was approached by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] is worried that I am willingly starving myself to death with my current diet. There is nothing wrong for a woman to have some curves, [From.GetSheHe] assured me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20659;It seems my attempts to sway my [GetFromRelation] into eating less were fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20660;It seems my attempts to sway my [GetFromRelation] into eating more were fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20663;I give myself another look at the mirror, brushing my hands over my dress to follow the curves of my beautiful, rippling body. I dare anybody to mistake me again for one of those insipid, skinny peasant girls working around town. This truly is the look of a [Root.GetTitle]: imposing and majestic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20664;I hold my breath for the third time, and the two poor maids pull the strings of my dress pushing in the fat. I give them a few words of encouragements and pull in the opposite direction. This extra weight of mine might give me trouble from time to time, but it has surely taught me the virtue of patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20665;I let out an satisfied mumble and sit back, rubbing my distended stomach and closing my eyes as I slowly fall asleep, ready to dream about my next meal. It is a simple routine I have fallen into since some time, but one that I quite enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20667;This morning, while reading by my window, I spotted the cook's daughter sitting by the courtyard. That stupid peasant girl was happily stuffing herself like a goose. I, on the other hand, have barely any strength left in my jaws to chew the softest, smallest of foods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20668;I cannot believe how many envious, malignant people are spreading rumors around me. But enough is enough. Since I am way too bored to whip them myself, I have decided to send all these nuisances directly to the dungeons whenever they start talking about my supposedly poor health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20669;All these years spent stuffing my belly with sweets have turned me a stout, shapely woman. I have not received many complaints, yet, sometimes I wonder if I am not putting my health at risk by eating so much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20670;It wasn't easy, but my determination and countless hours spent running and training outside have helped me gain some weight and strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHFP20674;It wasn't easy, but I have finally managed to overcome my weakly disposition. No longer the nimble, sickly girl I was before, I have now become a big, beautiful woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHFP20606;As I crumple and throw away another disappointing report, I yell at my servants, demanding for more food. As of late, eating is the only thing that has provided me with some relief from the stress of leadership. Unfortunately, as my flabby chest and double chin can attest, this solution might be having long term negative effects on my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20629;There are so many things to do, so many responsibilities filling my mind, that I barely have any time left to sleep or eat. All this stress is turning me into a hollow shell of my former self, but what else can I do? The life of a [Root.GetTitle] is not easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20647;No armor is large enough to fit me, no horse strong enough to carry me. [Root.Capital.GetName]'s blacksmith is currently working day and night designing a new reinforced throne for my courtroom, just so I can have something that is stable and wide enough to sit on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20648;I have come to the point where even loud noises upset me. I spend most of my days laying down, having my servants whisper the reports of the day and murmuring back my orders. My mind is still sound, but my body is growing too weak to sustain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20650;I am a bit concerned by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Eating so little and spending so many nights awake might not be good for [From.GetHerHis] health. [From.GetSheHeCap] always looks sick and is barely capable of holding a sword anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20668;After so many days spent waiting for a worthy enough target, I jumped on the ambassador like a feral beast. I struggled to overcome him, my body was too weak after my self-imposed deprivation. Even worse, his meat lost all its flavor after only a few bites. Perhaps suffering is a necessary condiment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHFP20669;Since I was a child, all the other boys at court always mocked me for being weak and sickly all the time. How am I supposed to fight and be a good [Root.GetTitle] when the faintest blow can knock me out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHFP20606;As I crumple and throw away another disappointing report, I yell at my servants, demanding for more food. As of late, eating is the only thing that has provided me with some relief from the stress of leadership. Unfortunately, as my bloated potbelly and bulging hips can attest, this solution might be having long term negative effects on my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20629;I give myself another look at the mirror, turning left and right, poking at my sides, looking for any trace of stretches or love-handles. A distinguished [Root.GetTitle] such as myself should strive to always look at [From.GetHerHis] best. Most people at court insist that I am ruining myself, eating so little, that it's not appropriate for any [Root.GetTitle] to be so thin, but what do they know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20647;Having a curvier body might have been fun at first, but now I have become the laughing stock of the whole court: no decent dress fits me and every child in [Root.Capital.GetName] sings songs about the thunderous thighs and gigantic belly of their [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20648;There was a day when I would revel in the envious gazes of other ladies looking at my slim figure, but not anymore: I have grown so frail and sickly that I can barely take a walk without risking to faint. Bards swear that I am as diaphanous as an angel, but right now I think I might rather be just a regular woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20650;I am a bit concerned by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Eating so little and spending so many nights awake might not be good for [From.GetHerHis] health. [From.GetHerHisCap] voice has turned into a whisper and I am starting to see [From.GetHerHis] bones sticking out from [From.GetHerHis] body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20669;Since I was a child, all the other girls at court always mocked me for my frail body and weakly disposition. How am I supposed to fulfill my duties as a woman when a gust of wind is enough to push me down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEHFP20606;I stuff another chunk of meat down my throat, lying over the empty dining table. My stomach is starting to hurt, but I cannot stop myself: eating is the only thing that brings a sparkle of happiness to my otherwise terrible existence. Why should I care if I get a little overweight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHFP20629;My servant leaves my bedroom, carrying away another untouched dinner. It has been some time now since I had any appetite. My skin is slowly turning pale, growing tighter over my skeletal features, but I still find no point in taking any more food that is required for me to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEHFP20669;I may not be the fastest runner, but I am without a doubt growing into a healthy, stout young man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFHFP20669;I may not be the fastest runner, but I am without a doubt growing into a sturdy young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCGHFP20606;I cannot recall the last time I left my [Root.GetHouse] to take a walk or inspect my demesne. All of this slouching is turning me into a flabby pig, but so what? I am [Root.GetTitle], I was not meant for manual labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHFP20629;No exercise and entire days spent without even bothering to get out of bed, coupled with a prolonged lack of appetite, are turning me into a pale shadow of my former self. All my physicians agree that my appetite would return if only I stepped outside my rooms every once in a while, but I have yet to find any truly legitimate reason to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGHFP20669;Lack of exercise and frequent snacks are turning young [From.GetFirstName] into a stout young man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHAFP20652;Today I was approached by my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has told me that [From.GetSheHe] has grown increasingly concerned by my eating habits. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks that I have gained quite a bit of weight in the last months, and now fears for my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHAFP20654;My [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice and has finally started to eat more. [From.GetSheHeCap] already looks in better shape, sturdier and more energetic, as any man should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHAFP20655;My [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice and has finally started to eat less. [From.GetSheHeCap] already looks in better shape, leaner, quicker and more energetic, as any man should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHAFP20656;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] was right. I feel a lot stronger and healthier since I took on my new diet. I am almost ashamed of the pathetic, shaking, little creep I was just not too long ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHAFP20657;I have been obsessing about my weight problem since the day [FromFrom.GetFirstName] first warned me about it. I think I am thinner now than I used to be, but is it enough? Every time I look in my mirror all I see is a bloated pig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHAFP20658;I was shocked to hear [From.GetFirstName]'s response to my warnings: apparently [From.GetSheHe] thinks that I am not truly concerned about [From.GetHerHis] health, and that this is all a plot of some sort to lower [From.GetHerHis] self-esteem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHBFP20654;My [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice and has finally started to eat more. [From.GetSheHeCap] already looks in better shape. In fact, she is starting to fill out quite nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHBFP20655;My [GetFromRelation] has taken on my advice and has finally started to eat less. [From.GetSheHeCap] already looks in better shape, slimmer and more graceful, as it is appropriate for a lady of her stature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHBFP20656;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] was right. I am quite enjoying my new voluptuous curves. Thinking back to the silly girl I was, starving myself to the brink of death just to look as skinny as a boy makes me chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHBFP20658;I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] realized I was lying or if it was just one [From.GetHerHis] paranoid streaks, but [From.GetFirstName] was not swayed by my words: in fact, [From.GetSheHe] openly claimed that I was trying to manipulate [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHCFP20654;I can scarcely believe it! The fool [From.GetFirstName] has fallen for my little lie, and surely enough, has soon started to choke [From.GetHerselfHimself] with food. I am looking forward to see the results of my little trick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHCFP20655;I can scarcely believe it! The fool [From.GetFirstName] has fallen for my little lie, and surely enough, has soon started to starve [From.GetHerselfHimself], panicking about [From.GetHerHis] excess weight. I am looking forward to see the results of my little trick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHCFP20656;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s advice was really the motivation that I needed to get back in shape. It was hard to adjust myself to a different diet at first, but now I am feeling much better, ready to take on whatever challenges the world might throw at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHCFP20657;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s advice was really the motivation that I needed to get back in shape. I cannot believe how close I was to spending the rest of my life as a fat pig, blissfully unaware of my own condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHDFP20656;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s advice was really the motivation that I needed to get back in shape. It was hard to adjust myself to a different diet at first, but now I am feeling reborn as a beautiful, healthy woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHDFP20657;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s advice was really the motivation that I needed to get back in shape. I cannot believe how close I was to spending the rest of my life as a fat cow, blissfully unaware of my own condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFP20600;Too much eating and too little exercise have caught up with me. I have gained the §YFat§! trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20601;I am finally back in shape. I have lost the §YFat§! trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20602;Too little eating turned me into a shell of my former self. I have gained the §YMalnourished§! trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20603;My bones no longer stick out my body. I have lost the §YMalnourished§! trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20607;I loosen up my belt and let out a satisfied sigh as my bloated belly fills my lap. Eating so much may not be what is best for my body, but it has certainly improved my attitude towards everyone at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20609;I can scarcely believe it, but everybody agrees that my health has actually improved since I started to eat more. Perhaps my body simply needs more food to work properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20610;I sit down, covered in sweat, looking at the flight of stairs spiraling down behind me. Tasks that were once easy have now become much more difficult to perform with my new flabby body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20611;Everybody at court agrees that I am the best host in the whole realm: my parties are the most grandiose, my food the most exquisite. All of my subjects have fallen in love with my charming and jovial attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20612;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is such a gracious host. Since some time now [From.GetSheHe] has become famous throughout the realm for [From.GetHerHis] jovial and welcoming nature as well as the exquisite food that [From.GetSheHe] graces [From.GetHerHis] guests with during [From.GetHerHis] parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20615;I might no longer be able to satiate my lust in real life, but the spare time I gained because of my forced abstinence has allowed me to discover a deep appreciation for books. At the end of the day, all I need in order to be happy is a good romance and a full belly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20617;I was happy to hear from [From.GetFirstName] that [From.GetSheHe] is truly enjoying my new self. Just this morning [From.GetSheHe] told me of how better I've been looking since some time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20619;I was relieved to see that my words did not go unheard. [From.GetFirstName] thanked me for my concern and promised me that [From.GetSheHe] will start dieting immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20620;Unfortunately it seems as if my words have gone unheard. [From.GetFirstName] has ignored my warnings and still spends [From.GetHerHis] days stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face with all sorts of food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20621;It has not been easy, but I think I am finally managing to get back in shape. Most of my old clothes have become too large for me and I can run a flight of stairs without arriving at the top drenched in sweat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20622;I have tried my best to stop eating so much, but it was all useless: despite all the tormented nights spent lying awake in my bed listening to the growling of my stomach, I cannot seem to lose any weight. I wonder if it is even worth keep trying anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20630;I may have grown thin and emaciated, but I have never felt so alive! There is always something to be done, something to be fixed: my mind is always hungry for new challenges to overcome. The satisfaction of looking back at a job well done is the only sustenance that I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20631;I have just realized that, since some time now, I have received more and more frequently visits from my family members. I am not sure if they think I am sick and about to die, or if they have simply taken pity on my miserable state, but they seem to be a lot more caring and polite when around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20633;The ambassador smiles politely at me and gives me his best wishes before leaving the court room. I can scarcely find anybody that doesn't appreciate my helpful and eager attitude. Having to take care of everybody's problems may be vexing, but has allowed me to significantly increase my network of friends and allies both at court and abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20634;It has been quite some time since I returned to my bedroom to sleep regularly. I have been informed that several people in my court are worried about me, that I am going insane in my library, but they simply do not understand how imperative it is for me to continue my research. My frail, decaying body is a small price to pay for the arcane secrets I am discovering within these walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20635;Continued meditation has helped me expunge all base desires from my flesh. As my body grows weaker, I feel my soul reaching for the divine, every day a bit closer to its apotheosis. I have long since started to ignore the small-minded advices of my courtiers about sleep, food, or exercise. I am far beyond such mundane needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20636;I was surprised to realize that my continued and rigorous abstinence has considerably improved my health. It appears that my body was in need of a bit more moderation in order to work better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20637;Today I was nearly trampled by my own horse after I fainted while taking a ride. It seems that my eating habits have eroded my health considerably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20639;I still need to be very careful about what I eat, and make sure to sleep as little as possible, lest some one of those vile turncoats pretending to be my servants can have his way with me, but I am definitely getting better at spotting the guilty looks and traitorous brows amongst the forgettable faces of my staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20640;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has not been taking care of [From.GetHerselfHimself] lately. The [From.GetManWoman] scarcely eats anything, never sleeps, and is quickly turning into a walking skeleton. If [From.GetSheHe] keeps going like this, [From.GetSheHe] might end up wasting away entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20641;Just today my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has openly praised me for my enviable shape, as well as my exemplary show of constraint and dedication in all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20643;I was relieved to see that my words did not go unheard. [From.GetFirstName] thanked me for my concern and promised me that [From.GetSheHe] will strive to lead a more balanced lifestyle in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20644;Unfortunately it seems as if my words have gone unheard. [From.GetFirstName] has ignored my warnings and still spends [From.GetHerHis] days wasting away in [From.GetHerHis] rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20645;It was not easy to force myself to break my old diet, but things seem to be finally getting better. The bags under my eyes have disappeared permanently, my skin has taken on some color again and I feel less likely to faint every time I exert myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFP20646;I have tried my best to ignore my natural instincts and force myself to eat more often, but it is of no use: every time I manage to take a little bite more than usual I end up feeling sick or puking everything out again. Dieting is making me feel worse than I ever was before. Perhaps I should just stop trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHHFP20606;I cannot recall the last time I left my [Root.GetHouse] to take a walk or inspect my demesne. It has become quite difficult for me to keep my weight in check as of late, but so what? A lady of my stature should not demean herself with manual labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHHFP20669;The sedentary lifestyle and frequent snacks are turning young [From.GetFirstName] into a sturdy young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP20606;I incite one of my servants to keep stuffing me with more delicacies, reveling in the onset of titillating nausea coursing through my body from my distended belly. My pursuit of all of the most extreme earthly pleasures is proving to be quite taxing for my body, but is it not this a very small price to pay for absolute pleasure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP20629;It is well past midnight. All the other curators have left the library and all lights have been shut off... except for mine. My hands are shaky as they turn the pages of the old tome on my table, and large bags have appeared under my eyes, yet I cannot stop: what is a wasted body compared to an enriched mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIHFP20669;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks I should play more often with my friends and eat less if I want to be able to ride when I grow up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMHFP20606;It is not easy being a mother. I cannot take any risks with myself when my children's future depends on my own health. The days I could freely go out for a ride, or play with the other ladies outside are over. Now I am committed to stay at home, tend to my family, and be a big happy woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMHFP20629;Day after day, I have pursued the teachings of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forsaking all excesses and temptations. I may have grown pale and frail, yet I feel that my spirit grows stronger and purer at each new hour I spend in devout abstinence. I have long since come to relish in the cramps and growls coming daily from my stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNHFP20606;It has been quite some time since I regularly went out hunting, or trained for combat. My body may no longer be what it used to, but spending more time at home with my beautiful wife gives me all the happiness I need in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOHFP20606;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies prepared by my cooks. I have to taste everything to make sure that the food is good for my guests after all, but all these private parties I organize have really done a number on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOHFP20629;My eyes twitch from the bite of half-chewed roast to the line of waiters silently standing by the table: my suspects are immediately confirmed when I spot a young servant girl looking away from me. As the guards drag the traitorous woman away from my sight, I throw the dish at the other servants. Everybody is trying to poison me, how am I supposed to eat anything at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQHFP20606;I scrape the bottom of another dish and give a frustrated look at my increasingly bloated body. It has been so long since I laid with a [Root.GetManWomanPreference]. Since after I took my vow of celibacy, I have found that the only thing that dims my burning passion is gorging myself on sweets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQHFP20629;Today I had to dismiss the polite concerns of another one of my Vassals regarding my health: it seems that many in my courts, while being very appreciative of the diligence with which I resolve any task or issue, are starting to fear I may be working myself to death: I always go to bed with bags under my eyes, and the smallest whiff of wind is enough to push me to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRHFP20606;I scrape the bottom of another dish and give a frustrated look at my increasingly bloated body. It has been so long since I laid with a [Root.GetManWomanPreference]. Since after I was mutilated, I have found that the only thing that dims my burning passion is gorging myself on sweets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCRHFP20629;This morning I had to rush to the gates to make sure an important missive was delivered before the Courier left the [Root.GetHouse]. At first, I chuckled when the servant mistook me for a pageboy, but now I have started to wonder if my dedication to my work and my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle] are becoming too vexing for my body to handle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHFP20606;After thoroughly beating the cook's servant, I kick him out of my rooms. Licking the grease off of my fingers, I sit down and the chair creaks under me, making my eye twitch. If I weren't surrounded by so many fools and sycophants, I wouldn't end up eating so much...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSHFP20629;I spit the half-chewed bite of chicken in my handkerchief and push away the dish in disgust. It is of no use: since I have tasted the sweetest meat of all, every other food has become insipid and repulsive to my body. Finding proper game to fill my refined palate is not easy, and as such, I am now starving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTHFP20606;I pull my hair in frustration and take another bite from my roasted beef, furiously chewing it down. I try taking a long breath to calm myself, but doing so only reminds me of my growing belly pressing against my clothes. The more I eat, the angrier I become, the angrier I am, the more I need to eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTHFP20629;I spit the half-chewed bite of chicken in my handkerchief and push away the dish in disgust. I cannot stand to eat anything less than human meat anymore. The very thought of filling my body with inferior creatures repulses me. Unfortunately, this means I can scarcely find anything to eat at all most days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUHFP20606;The world is spinning, as something rolls by me, clinking against the floor. Is that the... tenth bottle I had? "Just heave..!" I command the group of strong young men, struggling to carry me back into my bedroom. Sensing their effort, the realization of how fat all this beer is making me, finally pierces through my drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUHFP20629;I carefully examine the small piece of white meat on top of my knife, turning it left and right before placing it on the dish once more. So many people I know have died after having eaten rotten or impure food. If I want to live a long, safe life, I must sacrifice quantity for the sake of quality when it comes to eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVHFP20606;I let out a long yawn and blink, waiting for the ceiling to stop spinning. My servants must have brought me back to bed after another night of drinking. As I turn my head down, my eyes meet the dome of my beer belly, peeking over my breasts, and I let out a giggle. This wild lifestyle has not been great for my health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVHFP20629;My courtiers always try to encourage me to get out, take some sun, and enjoy life a bit more, but I simply cannot find anything that satisfies me. I am wasting by the week, yet all food seems stale to my palate... In the end, does it really matter if I am not in top physical shape anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWHFP20606;I take a deep breath and move my eyes from the half-finished dish on my table to my distended, aching stomach. I am well beyond full and the mere smell of the food is making me nauseous, yet I still take another bite. If I don't find something else to fill all these lazy afternoons, I might soon grow too fat to stand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWHFP20629;I pull the rim of my dress, looking at how large it has become in recent weeks. I am becoming really thin for whatever reason. My Courtiers are always inviting me to eat a bit more before I waste away entirely, yet I really cannot push myself to do it. All food seems entirely stale to my palate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCXHFP20606;As I unlace my dress to go to bed, I let out a sigh of relief as I feel my potbelly jump out, free of constraint. If I don't find something else to fill all these lazy afternoons, I might soon outgrow all my clothes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20606;I must find some other way to distract myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20607;I feel so much better now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20608;I feel so alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20609;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20610;Why am I always so tired?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20611;I am just happy that they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20612;How charming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20613;And there is a lot of me to love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20614;People like [From.GetHerHim] are rare indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20615;How thrilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20616;Nothing wrong with putting a little meat on your bones...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20617;How nice of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20618;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20619;A wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20620;All the worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20621;My diet is paying off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20622;I must force myself to hate food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20629;I should probably sleep more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20630;Work, o blissful work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20631;Not that I care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20632;Who could hate such a frail sad creature?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20633;I am always happy to be of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20634;A small price indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20635;I can almost feel ascending to the heavens already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20636;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20637;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20638;Such a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20639;Shadows and poison are everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20640;Nonsense! [From.GetHerHisCap] temperance and dedication are praiseworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20641;Very nice of you to say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20642;[From.GetSheHeCap] has a point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20643;A wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20644;All the worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20645;I might need new clothes though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20646;I must force myself to like food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20647;Enough! I must do some exercise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20648;I cannot succumb to apathy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20650;I will tell [From.GetHerHim] to eat less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20651;Are you sick, [From.GetFirstName]? You look bloated today...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20652;Pah! Nonsense! I don't believe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20653;Pah! Nonsense! I don't believe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20654;What a lovely sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20655;What a lovely sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20656;I will have to throw out my old clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20657;Ugh, I feel so hungry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20658;Whatever you say, [GetFromRelation]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20659;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20660;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20662;Hnnngh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20663;I couldn't agree more with myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20664;What alternative could there be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20665;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20666;I must never forget this feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20667;Grmpfh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20668;How tedious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20669;More military training is what I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20671;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20672;I need to rest a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20674;Maybe I overdid it a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20676;I will suggest the treatment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20677;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20678;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has failed me for the last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20679;No, wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20680;How convenient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20681;I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20682;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20683;[FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]! If you love me, kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20684;I must...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20685;Ghhh... How could you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20686;I must...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20687;What has that witch done to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20688;I should do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20689;I should do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20690;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20691;No longer I am a slave to passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20692;No harm in a bit of satire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20693;How about I have *you* roasted?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20694;The important thing is that nobody was hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20695;It is just a song, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20696;At least I am not his target...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20697;I should have had him killed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20698;I best not get on [From.GetHerHis] bad side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20699;Hmmm... And he smells delicious too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20700;I must vow to protect [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20701;It is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20702;Such a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20703;Superstitions, nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHFP20606;This is not the fate of a warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20616;I need to warn [From.GetHerHim], as politely as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20618;That is none of [From.GetHerHis] business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20622;I have to learn to stop eating whenever I am upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20629;Wasting away like this is unacceptable for a warrior like me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20640;I need to warn [From.GetHerHim], as politely as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20642;That is none of [From.GetHerHis] business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20646;I need to keep thinking of my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20647;I need a diet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20648;Enough, I must eat more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20650;Actually, I think [From.GetSheHe] could lose a bit more weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20651;Dear [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], [From.GetFirstName], I can see your bones sticking out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20652;Maybe I *have* been eating a bit too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20653;Maybe I should eat a bit more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20669;Maybe I should eat less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20676;Maybe I am wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20677;I am not submitting myself to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20678;A rational mind is all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20680;I shouldn't take advantage of [From.GetHerHis] good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20682;[From.GetSheHeCap] is the [From.GetTitle] after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20683;[FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]! If you love me, leave [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20692;I better remove the man from my employ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20693;An insult to the [Root.GetTitle] warrants some punishment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20699;He wasn't very funny anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHFP20700;[From.GetSheHeCap] can handle [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20606_A;I don't care, I am happy as I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_B;I don't care, I need this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_C;I could not possibly get up to work right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_D;More! I need more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20606_G;I don't care, the only thing that matters to me is my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_H;Meh. This is even better than sex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_I;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20606_L;Eh... who cares?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20616;Stop stuffing yourself, you pig!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622;If I let myself go I will only be more miserable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_A;Who am I kidding? I will always love food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_B;I cannot leave without at least this pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHFP20622_D;I cannot stand it anymore! I need to eat something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_E;I cannot stand it anymore! I need to eat something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_F;Is my vanity worth the love of my family?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_G;If I cannot satiate my lust, I should at least be allowed to fill my belly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_H;I am so angry I could eat an entire cow! In fact...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20622_I;I need to drink on this decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_A;Nonsense, temperance is indispensable to maintain good health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_B;Who has time for food anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_C;In fact, I'd rather not eat at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_D;Just another page...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_F;I must resist all temptations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_G;I cannot think of myself, there is just too much to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_H;I'd rather starve than be fooled by the likes of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_I;Eating is too much effort anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_L;I cannot demean myself with inferior food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20629_M;I must be very careful, always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20640;What's the matter with you? Eat something before you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20646;I should not make my life even more miserable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20647;Who cares? I am fine like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20648;This isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20650;Actually, [From.GetSheHe] could use a bit more meat on [From.GetHerHis] bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20652;Shut up! That's none of your business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20653;Shut up! That's none of your business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20661;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20669;Maybe I should eat more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20678;Enough with the leeches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20683;[From.GetSheHeCap] is right. This must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHFP20693;Oh, well! It was a rather funny song!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHFP20606;No, this is too much! I need a diet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20616;It is none of my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20622;If I don't do anything, I shouldn't eat anything either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20629;No, this is too much! I need to eat something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20640;It is none of my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20646;Appetite or not, I have to eat something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20650;I will tell [From.GetHerHim] to eat more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20651;This is too petty even for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20669;I am fine like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHFP20669_ZE;It's nice being big!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHFP20622;I won't be able to enjoy my life if I eat myself to an early grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20646;My research will have to wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20650;I don't think this is any of my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHFP20669;But why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHFP20622;I can't sacrifice my health for my family's sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHFP20646;I must force my mind to the mundane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHGP20622;Enough! There is only one way to fix this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHHP20622;A crushed spirit is better than a crushed body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_A;Eating so much is simply against my nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_B;This is wrong, I will not stand for it anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_C;Eating against my whims is simply too much effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_D;I need to get back to my studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_E;The divine beckons me, enough with food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_F;I have risked to be poisoned more than enough times already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_G;I cannot waste time with this stupid diet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_H;Why deny it? I only crave for human flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHIP20646_I;I must stop this diet immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTGHFP20646;I must risk the poison to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHHFP20646;I must rest if I want to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHFP20622;I guess I will have to try and stop drinking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
