EVTDESC_79000_A;While I'm busy fighting, I notice in the corner my eye, a giant man heading straight for me, a huge ax swinging wildly in my direction. Panic begins to rise in my chest when a moment later the giant staggers and falls, hit square in the jaw by the shield of my Shieldmaiden [From.GetFirstName]! What a throw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79000_B;In the midst of the battle I see a giant man heading straight for me, a huge ax swinging wildly in my direction. A moment later the giant staggers and falls, a spear jutting out of his right eye. Rising behind him is my Shieldmaiden [From.GetTitledFirstName], calm triumph in her eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79001;Fighting alongside my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] is exhilarating. We move together like two arms of one being, an unstoppabl-\nThe roar of pain from behind startles me, and I spin around to see [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] clutching her side. "My [Root.GetLordLady]... I'm sorry," she says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79002;Fighting alongside my [shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] is exhilarating. We move together like two arms of one being, an unstoppabl-\nThe sharp pain startles me, and I stagger to my knees. [shieldmaiden_liege.GetFirstName] charges my attacker, almost deliriously, while I feel the world go dark. "My [From.GetLordLady]... I'm sorry," I manage to utter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_A;It's with a heavy heart that I visit my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName]. It's been some time since her injury, but the incident has left her maimed and she hasn't shown herself around court lately. I find her in her chambers, staring out the window. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_B;Concerned about her absence in the training grounds recently, I visit my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName]. The enemy claimed her right eye, but I didn't expect it to get to her... I find her in her chambers, her face turned from me. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_C;After her injury, I made certain that my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] was fitted with a wooden leg of the finest quality, yet I haven't seen her around much lately. After deciding to pay her a visit, I find her sitting idly by her window. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_D;After the battle, they had to amputate my Shieldmaiden's hand. Although a tough blow to any warrior, I didn't expect it to get to her. During my visit, she sits idly by her window. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_E;After the battle, the full extent of her injuries became apparent - a blow to the head left the face of the fierce Shieldmaiden a mess. In spite of wearing a mask to cover her misfortune, [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] has grown more reclusive. I find her one day, sitting alone in a window. "Don't worry, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_F;It's with a heavy heart that I visit my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName]. It's been some time since her injury, but the incident has left her maimed and she hasn't shown herself around court lately. I find her in her chambers, staring out the window. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79003_G;It's with a heavy heart that I visit my Shieldmaiden [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName]. It's been some time since her injury, but the incident has changed her and she appears to have almost removed herself from court. I finally find her in her chambers, staring out the window. "Don't trouble yourself, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she says. "I did my duty. It's what we do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79004_A;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] came to see me today. [shieldmaiden_liege.GetSheHeCap] had [shieldmaiden_liege.GetHerHis] physician take a look at me, but after I laid out the details of the story the physician boggled at me: "That's quite the battle!" I suppose I am lucky to be alive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79004_B;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] came to see me today, to check up on my injuries. [shieldmaiden_liege.GetSheHeCap] seems intent on visiting me again. I can't help but wonder whether it's [shieldmaiden_liege.GetHerHis] conscience making [shieldmaiden_liege.GetHerHim] approach me? There's really no need - all I did was my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79004_C;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] came to see me today, to check up on my injuries. [shieldmaiden_liege.GetSheHeCap] then proceeded to tell me a great many things about how fortunate [shieldmaiden_liege.GetSheHe] is to have me in [shieldmaiden_liege.GetHerHis] service. All in all, I admit I almost blushed at some of the compliments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79005_A;[my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] and I are in the garden, when the Shieldmaiden draws her dagger. "What?" I whisper, but she motions me to silence. Then I hear it: an unusual rustling in the bushes. I'm shocked! An ambush? In broad daylight? Relief washes over me as a small kitten suddenly jumps out in front of us, purring playfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79005_B;My dear [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] and I are in the garden, when we hear an unusual rustling in the bushes. My Shieldmaiden draws her dagger immediately, her keen senses alert. My heart is pounding. An ambush? In broad daylight? Relief washes over me as a small kitten suddenly jumps out in front of us, purring playfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79005_C;The vigilant [my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName] and I are in the garden, when we hear an unusual rustling in the bushes. The Shieldmaiden draws her dagger and motions me to silence. I hold my breath, my heart pounding. An ambush? In broad daylight? Relief washes over me as a small kitten suddenly jumps out in front of us, purring playfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79006_A;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] and I were having a conversation in the gardens today, when we were startled by a little cat making a surprising amount of noise from the bushes. After drawing my weapon, ready to defend my liege, [shieldmaiden_liege.GetFirstName] decided to bring the cat home with [shieldmaiden_liege.GetHerHim]. It was touching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79006_B;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] and I were having a conversation in the gardens today, when we were startled by a little cat making a surprising amount of noise from the bushes. After drawing my weapon, ready to defend my liege, [shieldmaiden_liege.GetFirstName] convinced me to take the cat home with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79006_C;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetTitledFirstName] and I were having a conversation in the gardens today, when we were startled by an unusual rustling from the bushes. After drawing my weapon, ready to defend my liege, a small cat jumped out in front of us. We had a good laugh about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79007;I must've been but a child when I was first seen in the training ground, a stick as my sword, rocks and bushes my enemies. While I never stopped honing my skills entirely, I worry now that I've stagnated. The pressure has further increased since I was appointed Shieldmaiden. How should I keep in shape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79008_A;A servant surprised me today by bringing my beloved, albeit a little too adventurous, dog back to me! They had found it going through the garbage behind the barracks. Not picky, that thing. Either way, I shrieked with joy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79008_B;A servant asked if I wanted the missing posters for my dog taken down. He's right, I suppose. I'll never see that creature again and I it is time I came to terms with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79009;During the battle of [Root.Location.GetName] I spot a man almost the size of a mammoth, lumbering towards my liege [my_liege.GetTitledFirstName]. However, the [my_liege.GetTitle] is busy fighting in the other direction and doesn't seem at all aware of the beast approaching. My mind starts racing. One swing of that ax could easily cut [my_liege.GetFirstName] in half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79010_A;I take aim at the enemy and I cock my arm back. My shield is hurled through the air at incredible speed - it spins like a disc of gold as the sunshine is reflected on the metal. The giant is hit, square in his head, and he drops to his knees. [my_liege.GetTitledFirstName] turns, surprise and awe on [my_liege.GetHerHis] face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79010_B;I cock my arm back and my shield is hurled through the air at incredible speed, spinning like a disc of gold as the sunshine is reflected on its metal. On and on it flies, until I begin to question my aim... Did I miscalculate the direction of the wind? The giant is distracted by the maneuver, however, and [my_liege.GetTitledFirstName] has time to raise [my_liege.GetHerHis] shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79010_C;With a loud war cry I hurl my spear over the battlefield. It shoots through the air like dark lightning and soldiers turn their head to stare. By the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] it finds its target, right in the eye of the massive warrior. Of course, there was some skill involved as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79010_D;I scream as I cock my arm back to throw my spear. I fail to notice the soldier behind me though, staggering, I fling my spear in the general direction of my liege. The haphazard hurl does hit the giant in the side however, and my liege nods at me over the battlefield, just before the giant spins and charges at me instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79011_A;[my_liege.GetTitledFirstName] is cut through like butter. I'm not sure when I'll forget the sight of it all. At least I was far away and nobody blamed me for not stepping in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79011_B;My liege [my_liege.GetTitledFirstName] handled the massive man expertly, and [my_liege.GetSheHe] made it look almost effortless! Perhaps I underestimate the [my_liege.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79012_A;Out on the battlefield I'm suddenly face to fa... Face to stomach with a gigantic warrior, his furious cry of war resonating in my very bones. Before I have time to raise my sword I feel a warm liquid soaking through my tunic. When I lower my gaze I see my armor somehow ripped in two, and blood gushing out of me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79012_B;Out on the battlefield I'm suddenly face to fa... Face to stomach with an impressive warrior - finally a challenge! I thrust my sword into his knee and then I slash wildly at his enormous hands as he reaches for the pain. In the end I am covered in blood, but I feel great. Wonder where [From.GetFirstName] was this whole time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79013_A;During the chaos of the battle I notice something moving fast in the corner of my eye... The shield of [From.GetFirstName] flies past me, and I spin to see a giant warrior just about to cleave down on me with his ax. I raise my shield, but the blow cuts through it like butter. "Soldiers! TO ME!" I yell desperately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79013_B;The battle of [Root.Location.GetName] is chaos and there are some intimidating warriors here - one giant of a man was just about to assault me when my Shieldmaiden [From.GetFirstName] distracted him with a seemingly random throw of her spear... I'm not sure it was intentional, but it was a brave sacrifice, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79020;I was summoned to the [FromFrom.GetTitle] today. Impressed by my martial skills and combat practice [FromFrom.GetSheHe] wants to appoint me Shieldmaiden! Although a prestigious title, being a member of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] personal guard is likely to on occasion be a dangerous job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79021;I knew I was right to trust my gut regarding [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The woman has accepted my proposal and she is now my new Shieldmaiden!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79022;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused my proposal. She curtsied as she conveyed her thoughts on the matter, but made no attempt to explain herself. I admit to feeling a little confused. Who wouldn't be honored to be my Shieldmaiden?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79023_A;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to relieve me of my duties. I am no longer a Shieldmaiden in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] employ. I suppose it could have something to do with that embarrassing river incident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79023_B;Having proven myself as a Shieldmaiden, I am a bit surprised to be relieved of my duties, but I respect the wishes of my liege. I shall remember my days as Shieldmaiden for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] with pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79023_C;After my blunder on the battlefield I can't blame [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] for deciding to relieve me of my duties as Shieldmaiden... I suppose I have other qualities?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79023_D;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to relieve me of my duties as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] official Shieldmaiden. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] says it's for my own good and while it's not glorious, I could make do with a more quiet life. Maybe I'll pick up harp-playing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_79023_E;I can only guess [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reasoning for it, but [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to relieve me of my duties as Shieldmaiden. I suppose it was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_79000;That was a close one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79000_TOOLTIP;§Y[From.GetFirstName]§! had your back!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_79005_TOOLTIP;It's love at first sight and you bring the kitten home.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79006;[shieldmaiden_liege.GetSheHe] named the cat after me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79007;I shall go rowing every morning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79008;Reunited at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79009;I'll throw my shield at the giant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_79009_TOOLTIP_2;your shield missing its target, injuring your liege.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79010;I wasn't made Shieldmaiden for my looks alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79011;The poor fool should never have trusted me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79012;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], take me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79012_TOOLTIP;The last thing you see before it all goes dark is your Shieldmaiden §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! in the distance... You try to call out, but you're choking.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_79013_TOOLTIP;Your Shieldmaiden §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! rushes to your side, but it is too late.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79020;I would be honored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79021;I have a good feeling about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79022;There's no pleasing some people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79023;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_79023_TOOLTIP;People will remember your service to the [FromFrom.GetTitle].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_79000;What would I do without [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79003;You're truly exceptional. Will you let me visit you more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79003_TOOLTIP;You offer to stand by §Y[my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName]'s§! side, at least for the duration of her recovery.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79005;[my_shieldmaiden.GetFirstName], I think it likes you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79005_TOOLTIP;You urge your Shieldmaiden to care for the cat.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79006;I could name the creature after [shieldmaiden_liege.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79007;I'll go running with my dog! That could be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79008;Time to let go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79009;My spear will make the beast one-eyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79009_TOOLTIP;Depending on your combat skills you may or may not be able to land a perfect throw.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_79010;It looks like [my_liege.GetSheHe] will live, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79010_TOOLTIP;This was not your best rescue.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79011;This will not reflect well on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79011_TOOLTIP;People are surprised how slow on your feet you were today.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79012;How strange that my Shieldmaiden didn't back me up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79012_TOOLTIP;Soldiers say they saw her back away from your fight! Maybe she just had a bad day?\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79013;What was she thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79013_TOOLTIP;Soldiers say they saw her struggling to hold off the massive warrior alone for several minutes, after which it took ten men to take him down.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79020;I'm not really Shieldmaiden material...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_79020_TOOLTIP;You respectfully decline.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_79003;Nevertheless, the bards shall compose songs in your name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
