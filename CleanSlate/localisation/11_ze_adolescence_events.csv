EVTOPTB_ZE_13623;Others may try to trick you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13624;Don't be distracted by lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13625;Be thorough, make others count on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13700;[lustful_target.GetFirstName], kissing me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13701;[Root.GetSheHeCap] is the one for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13702;[lustful_target.GetSheHeCap] gets me all excited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13703;Maybe it will change with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_13001;If they protest I will crush them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13004;Yes, [From.GetTitledFirstName]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13011;Why would anyone want to harm me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13014;I help when I can, but rarely see a need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13021;Only the foolish take risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13024;I'd rather be myself by myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13031;Thinking was never my strong side anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13034;Honestly, I don't care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13041;I was just born stubborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13044;I have nothing yet, but [Root.GetSheHe] who dares wins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13051;It should all be mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13054;I don't care what that [GetRootFromInsult] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13061;It is truly the ultimate good in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13064;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13071;The world is made of pixie dust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13074;I'll let [From.GetHerHim] think it's working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13084;It's not wise to be overly zealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13091;I must be wary of their envy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13094;But gold is so pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13101;It feels great to learn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13102;Girls will be girls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13104;Is [From.GetSheHe] not interested in the world at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13111;They strike me with awe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13114;I shall love them when they have something interesting to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13610;...no, I had better keep these thoughts for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13611_CARP;Suggest a secluded cuddle inside the barn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13611_FERR;Suggest a secluded cuddle inside the barn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13620;[From.GetFirstName] must learn on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13625;Make your move at the right time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13700;Whatever it was is not important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13701;If I see [Root.GetHerHim] again we'll have some fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_ZE_13004;[From.GetSheHeCap]'ll be lucky if I don't poison [From.GetHerHis] food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13014;But the [Root.TopLiege.GetTitle] provides for all, surely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13024;There is nothing wrong with being cautious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13034;I don't even know what that means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13044;I'll decide for myself, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13054;That's easy for [From.GetHerHim] to say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13064;I'd rather not talk with food in my mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13074;But I was invisible the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13094;But they hate me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13104;Too clever for [From.GetHerHim], maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13114;I'm fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13610;...no, these feelings are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13700;I should just try to get to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13701;I shouldn't. It's a sin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
