EVTDESC_CM_2012;You are riding through your domains in the company of your household guard, when you come upon a bridge crossing a rapid river. On the bridge stands a dark-clad warrior in heavy armor with his sword drawn. When challenged, he refuses to get out of the way, speaking only the words: 'None shall pass'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_2102;You grow weary of spending so much time in your castle, performing tedious duties of government and diplomacy. Meanwhile, [From.GetTitledFirstName] keeps telling you of all the interesting adventures he experiences in your service. But perhaps you could join him next time he rides out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CM_2104;You ride out one fine morning in the company of [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], taking no escort and wearing practical rather than regal attire. This will be a good break from the monotony of your court. You catch [From.GetTitledFirstName] giving you a sceptical look, but you are sure this will be a fine journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_2012;[From.GetFirstName], take care of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_2102;Yes, I think I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CM_2104;What could possibly go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_2012;What a strange man. I will kill him myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CM_2102;No, I must tend to my duties as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CM_2012;Hmm, let's take another road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
