EVTDESC107000;Behold! The world as we know it in the year of our Saviour, 1066. As you can tell, it is divided into distinct regions - Counties - each controlled by some ruler or another. Crusader Kings II is a game about these rulers, their families, relations, intrigue... and power. Be a conqueror or a peaceful family father, as you will, but know that most other characters will lust after more land, more Counties.\n\nCrusader Kings II is a real-time game. Close this window and unpause the game using the speed widget...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107001;You will play as a succession of characters from the same Dynasty, down the ages. In this Learning Scenario, you will be safe from attack and internal strife until your ruler turns 40 years old. When this happens, [Root.GetFirstName] will die (normally though, characters die of old age, disease or violence) and the Learning Scenario will end. When [Root.GetSubjectPronoun] dies, you can keep playing a normal game as [Root.GetPossPronoun] Heir. Feel free to navigate through the game as you wish, but note that if you do not follow the Learning Scenario instructions you might miss out on further help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107002;The main currencies in this game are your Wealth, Prestige and Piety. Wealth is of course the monetary currency (you can call it 'gold' if you like), and increases primarily through taxation. Prestige is a measure of your success and prestige as a ruler, and your Piety shows how respected you are by the clergy. The Prestige and Piety of all your characters will be added to your score, determining your final rank when the game ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107003;During the Learning Scenario, you will get messages like this to help you to figure out what you can do next. You are, however, free to click around and do things on your own. Whenever you run out of things to do, it might be helpful to check out the Alerts that appear at the top of the screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107004;Depending on what you are currently doing, there are several Map Modes to suit your needs. The default Map Mode is the Terrain Map Mode. Another helpful map mode is the Independent Realms Map Mode, showing the borders of the different Realms in the world. Feel free to check out the different Map Modes in the lower right corner to see what they show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107005;This is you, up in the left corner. Clicking the Portrait will give you more information about [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and his family. You can also click on the Crest next to the portrait to get information about your Country.\n\nClick the Portrait to find out more about your Ruler and his family. Note that you are currently unmarried and your Heir is your brother, the King of Castille. Should you die at this point, you can keep playing as him since he is of your Dynasty. Yes, that means he would inherit Le√≥n and be king of two Kingdoms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107006;In the same screen, you can also see your Attributes and Traits, which represent your skills and personality.\n\nCharacters can also have an Ambition, which represents their current short term goal. Whenever an Ambition is fulfilled the character will get a reward, such as a Prestige or Piety bonus. Click on the 'Choose an Ambition'-button, look at your Ambitions and choose one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107007;Although you do have a valid Heir of your Dynasty (your brother), having children of your own will ensure that there is a next generation of successors. Besides, your brother might die before you do. As soon as you have a son, he will be your new Heir. To produce legitimate children you need to get married! The Arrange Marriage view, found by clicking on your portrait, is a good tool for finding suitable spouses (it's the button with the two golden rings). You can also use the Character Browser in the bottom right corner of the screen to find more characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107008;When looking at potential spouses, there are a few things you should keep in mind: First, your spouse's Attributes will boost your own, so a skilled spouse is preferable. Secondly, marriages are the only way to secure Alliances in the game, so try to marry into the close family of rulers you want to ally. Third, you cannot marry children, but you can betroth them (though that will not yield any Attribute boost.) Right now it would be wise to marry a healthy adult woman of childbearing age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107009;When you have found a good character to marry, right-click on their portrait to open the Diplomacy Menu. Here you may ask the Liege of your intended about the possibility of arranging a marriage. The Diplomacy Menu is the main way to interact with other characters. Go ahead and arrange the marriage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107100;Congratulations on your marriage! While Alfonso is busy trying to get [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] with child, you might want to select a new, family oriented Ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107101;Your Realm consists of a number of Counties (the provinces on the map). Each County contains at least one Holding (Castle, City or Temple). By clicking on a County you can see - among other things - its Holdings. The Holdings held by you personally are collectively called your Demesne. Unfortunately, there is a limit to how many Holdings you can control directly. This value is shown in the top bar. If you have more Holdings than your limit, you will start to suffer serious penalties...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107102;The Demesne Limit is the reason you need Vassals! You can control more Holdings than your Demesne Limit allows indirectly through your Vassals. Your Vassals will give a part of their troop Levies and Taxes to you. There is a limit to how many Vassals you can have as well, which is why you might want to have fewer - but more powerful - Vassals. Vassals can also have Vassals, and so on. Vassals of the lowest rank (below Count, with a copper portrait frame) are not counted towards the Vassal Limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107103;You need to keep your Vassals happy, because their Opinion of you controls how much Tax and Levies they will give you. If they dislike you enough, they might even join rebellious Factions, which can lead to civil wars. Bishops (priestly vassals) who like the Pope more than you will actually send their Taxes to him instead! Opinions are represented by a number ranging from -100 to 100, and you can see exactly why they feel the way they do by hovering over the number.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107104;You currently have one unhappy Vassal. You can find this Vassal by clicking on your portrait and open the 'Vassals' tab. Try to increase the Opinion of this Vassal to a positive number. You can increase the Opinion of your Vassals towards you in several ways, for example by giving them more land (but do try to hold as much land as your Demesne Limit allows!). You can also give them an Honorary Title, or send them a gift. All this can be done in the Diplomacy Menu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107202;Oh dear, it seems the ungrateful peasants of Salamanca have revolted against you! To deal with the Revolt, you need to raise your Levies. If you go to the Military View you will see the buttons that allow you to raise your Personal Levies and your Vassal Levies. By holding down Control when you click the button you will avoid raising levies in Counties with enemy troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107203;To move your Armies around, simply click on their Shield to select them and then right click on the Province you want them to go to. You can also select several Armies by holding down your left mouse button and dragging the mouse to create a selection box. It is wise to gather your troops together before attacking the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107204;When you have moved all your Armies to the same Province, select them all (by click-and-drag) and then click the Merge Troops button in the Army window to merge them into a single Army. You can also assign and change the Leaders of your Army by clicking on the name bar above each flank. Leaders can help you win battles, but there is always the risk of them getting injured or even killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107205;When attacking across a Strait or River, you will get a penalty for that fight. Click on a Province and hover over the River Icon (if any) to see on which border the Rivers and Straits are. Note that if the target Province is under siege, you will need to toggle from Siege View to Province View. Go ahead and crush the peasant rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107250;You dealt with the Revolt nicely! Now that you are at peace, it would be wise to dismiss your Levies. Having raised Personal Levies will cost you money, and Vassals will get angry if you have their Levies raised for too long. You dismiss Levies in the Military tab, the same way they were raised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107251;Now would be a good time to consider expanding your Realm. The easiest targets for military expansion are small neighboring realms. However, since you need to know about fleet operations, let's pick Canarias, a single County realm just off the coast of West Africa...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107252;In order to go to War in Crusader Kings II, you'll need a Casus Belli - a 'just cause'. A valid Casus Belli could be, for example, pressing a Claim on a Province that is rightfully yours, or waging a Holy War against infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107253;Claims can be obtained in several ways: First, you will usually get Claims on any Titles inherited by your siblings when your parents die. Rulers who lose Titles (in a War, for example) will also get Claims on any lost lands. Lastly, of course, Claims can also be fabricated by a crafty ruler... Since Canarias is so distant, you can, unfortunately, not use the Holy War Casus Belli, so you must Fabricate a Claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107254;To Fabricate Claims, open your Council View and assign your Chancellor to Fabricate Claims and place him in the County of Canarias. You do this by clicking on the Fabricate Claims button and then on the Province on the map. (You can assign jobs like this to all your Council Members, but they can only do one job at a time.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107300;You now have a Claim and it's time to let slip the dogs of War! Click on Canarias province and right-click the Ruler Portrait in the County View. Select 'Declare War' in the Diplomacy Menu and the 'Claim Canarias' Casus Belli. Send the War Declaration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107301;If you have allies they will always join automatically in all your wars. Some allies (like Tribal Vassals) will have to be called into your wars to join them (if they accept).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107302;If you're fighting an overseas enemy you need to raise your Fleet. In order to do this you open the Military View as you did when raising your Armies, then navigate to the 'Fleet Levies' tab where you find similar buttons to raise your Fleet.\n\nYou should also raise your troops and move them to your coastal County, Asturias de Oviedo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107303;It appears you don't have enough ships to transport the Army. Sometimes when you're at War, the Levies from your Demesne and your Vassals might not be enough. In these cases it is wise to hire Mercenaries. This can be done via the Mercenaries Tab in the Military View. Newly hired Mercenaries arrive in your capital County. They are very expensive, both to hire and maintain. Take a look at the mercenary composition before you hire them. Some are made entirely out of Armies while others consist only of Fleets. Hire some naval mercs! They will spawn in a Sea Area West of your Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107304;To load your troops onto ships, bring your Fleet into port by ordering it to move into one of your land Provinces. You can then move your Armies to the same Province, merge them by clicking the Merge Troops button like before and click the Embark Army button. You can also move your Armies onto a Fleet at sea by keeping the Fleet in a coastal sea Province and moving your troops onto your ships. Note that larger Fleets are required for transporting larger Armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107305;When your Fleet has reached its destination, you can disembark your Armies by clicking on the 'Select Troops' button while you have your Fleet targeted. After that you can right click on the Province you wish to move them to. Note that when you disembark your Armies into battle, you will get a penalty for that fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107306;When your Armies stop in enemy lands, they will start to besiege any enemy Holdings. In order to fully occupy a Province, you will need to take every Holding in that Province. Winning a Siege takes time, and the attacking forces need to be larger than the defending Garrison. The more the attackers outnumber the defenders, the faster the siege will be. The Fort Level of the settlement will also affect the time it will take to siege. To view the Siege progress, select your Army or click on the Province under Siege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107307;If you want to win a Siege quickly, you can choose to Assault the besieged Holding. There is no guarantee of success, however, and even a successful Assault may come at a high cost to the attacking Army. Castles tend to have stronger Fortification levels than Cities and Church Holdings. Note that if your Army runs out of morale and has no neighbouring Province to retreat to, it will be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107310;You are now ready to make Peace. To do this, click on the War icon in the bottom right of the screen. You can also right-click the portrait of the character you are fighting and open their Diplomacy Menu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107311;When offering Peace you have three possible options to choose from. You can either Surrender, Offer White Peace or Enforce Demands. Detailed information on each will be shown when hovering over the options. The exact Peace conditions will depend on what Casus Belli was used for the War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107320;Now that the War is over, you can dismiss your Mercenaries and Levies again. Find a new target for expansion, and consider placing your Chancellor there to Fabricate Claims. You can also use the Holy War Casus Belli against your Muslim neighbours. The latter can be a bit more risky since any ruler of the opposing religion might join your enemy in the War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107325;You are now over your Demesne Limit, meaning you have more Holdings than is seemly for you to rule personally. Your Vassals will dislike you for being over this limit, so you need to do something about it, and soon! In the long term, you can increase your demesne limit by increasing your Stewardship Attribute (and your wife's), but in the short term you need to give some of your Titles to your Vassals. You can do this by clicking on the character you want to give Titles to, and open their Diplomacy Menu. Look in the Character Finder or in the Court Tab in your Character View to find suitable characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107326;You are now over your Vassal Limit, meaning you have more Vassals than you can control. Your Vassals will then give you reduced Taxes and Levies, and you might even lose some Vassals when you die and your Heir takes over. In the long term you can increase your Vassal Limit by increasing your Diplomacy, but in the short term you can Transfer Vassalage so that you have fewer Direct Vassals. You can do this by clicking on the character you want to give Vassals to, and open their Diplomacy Menu. The target character must be of a higher tier than the Vassal you wish to give away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107327;Both your Vassal Limit and your Demesne Size Limit can be increased through the Centralization Law. Low Centralization will give you a bonus to your Vassal Limit, whereas High Centralization will increase your Demesne Size. As you see, you'll have to make a choice here. Demesne Laws such as Centralization can only be changed once every five years. Also, Centralization can only be changed one step at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107328;The higher levels of the Crown Authority and Centralization laws are restricted by your Technology Level. In order to unlock the more advanced Laws, you must invest in Legalism, found in the Technology View. Legalism is found in the Culture Advances technology tree and costs Cultural Technology Points. The other two technology categories are Military and Economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107329;You have been given Technology Points for each of the three types of Advances. Find some Advances that interest you and click the corresponding Invest button to spend Technology Points and increase it to the next level. Technology Points are gained over time, but Technology also eventually advances by itself if neighbouring Provinces are more developed in that particular field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107330;You now have a son and Heir. Your Realm follows the Agnatic-Cognatic Gavelkind Law, which means that daughters inherit only if there are no sons, and all Titles will be distributed among your children upon death. Available Succession Laws and Gender Laws can be seen under the Laws View.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107331;You now have a daughter and Heir. Your Realm follows the Agnatic-Cognatic Gavelkind Law, which means that daughters inherit only if there are no sons, and all Titles will be distributed among your children upon death. You should know that Vassals tend to dislike female Rulers (that's the Middle Ages for you). Available Succession Laws and Gender Laws can be viewed under the Laws View.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107332;As you might have seen in the Laws View, some Succession Laws require a higher Crown Authority. Crown Authority, which is also found in this view, represents how much legal authority you have over your Vassals. Crown Laws such as this one, indicated by the crown icon next to its name, can only be changed once per ruler. Crown Authority can also only be changed one step at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107333;You now have a son, and following your Agnatic-Cognatic gender laws your first-born daughter is discredited from any inheritance. Instead, your son will inherit your Titles should you die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107334;One of your children is now old enough to be Tutored by a Guardian. By opening your Diplomacy Menu you can select the 'Educate Child' option. A Guardian will be automatically suggested, but feel free to click on the suggested Guardian in order to choose another one if you wish. You will want a Guardian with good Traits and Attributes, or use this opportunity and let a Vassal that dislike you to get the honor of becoming the Guardian of your child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107340;We mentioned Claims earlier. Your character has Claims on the Kingdoms of Castille and Galicia, as you can see if you click on your portrait. There might be a less risky way to press this Claim than going to War, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107341;The King of Castille is actually your brother, and you are currently his Primary Heir. To really make sure that you inherit his Kingdom, you could try to kill him before he can father a son to supplant you as Heir. If you click on your brother's Portrait, you can create a Plot to kill him by clicking on the Plot icon to the left of his Portrait. You can also start Plots from the Plot View. Start a Kill Plot against your dear brother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107342;Now you have a Plot going, but you will need the help of others to succeed. You can find Potential Plotters through the Plot View. Not all Potential Plotters might want to join your shady schemes, however. The ones that are hesitant but still close to accepting will usually come to their senses once you bribe them with gifts. To make this simpler, you can also check the 'Auto-invite Plotters' option on the Plot in the Plot View.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107343;The assassination was successful and your brother is dead... but don't feel too bad about it - after all, this is the Middle Ages! You are now the king of two Kingdoms - Le√≥n and Castille! You can use the same technique to get your hands on the Kingdom of Galicia as well, reuniting your father's Realm. Yes, in order to do it you will have to kill your other brother before he spawns a son!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107344;Congratulations, another brother lies dead and you have successfully reunited your father's Realm! This concludes the main Learning Scenario, although as long as [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is alive, you might get more messages depending on what happens in the game. You now know everything you need in order to survive and thrive, but there are many more features to discover and master. (Check out the various Tutorial chapters, or simply learn by doing...) Good luck, Kinslayer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107345;Someone in your Realm has started a Faction against you! You can see this Faction, its leader and any other members in the Factions View. Some Faction members might consider leaving a Faction if their opinion of you is increased, but in many cases you might need to get rid of them in some other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107350;The Learning Scenario has now ended. Your character died, and if you wish you can now keep playing the game as your Heir, continuing to create the epic story of your Dynasty down through the generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107360;The Incapable Trait was removed from your character since you are playing the Learning Scenario.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
