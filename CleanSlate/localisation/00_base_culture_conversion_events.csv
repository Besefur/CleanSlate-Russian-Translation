EVTDESC55000;The [Root.Culture.GetName] populace in [Root.GetName] have embraced [Root.Holder.Culture.GetName] culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55001;The [Root.Culture.GetName] populace in [Root.GetName] resent me as a ruler and feel that I am a foreigner, yet I depend on these selfsame people to collect my taxes and man my army. This simply will not do. I think it is time to bring some boys from back home over to help out here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55002;For as long as have ruled here we Normans have entrusted the raising of our children to Saxon nursemaids. Our first words would not be Norman French but Saxon. As we grew up we learned to speak a tongue that was neither one nor the other. Now is this time to make this tongue our own so we may all communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55003;Around our lands more people are using this English language and I find this is a perfect means for a Norman overlord to get his Saxon serfs to work properly. We continue to use our own influence to promote this means of communication in the interests of more efficient realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55004;Although every civilised man in Christendom knows that French is the true language of communication, this new English language does have a certain functionality. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55005;I was considering important business when I had an amazing insight. To strengthen my realm I must bring my vassals round to my way of thinking. This involves communication. If I can get them to communicate like me then I will have a much smoother running realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55006;My liege has persuaded me to embrace this notion of Englishness that is sweeping the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55010;My roots may be [Root.Culture.GetName], but I identify more with the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] people I rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55011;[From.GetTitledName] has adopted the foreign ways of [From.Capital.GetName], behaving more like a petty [From.Capital.Culture.GetName] burgher than a proper [Root.Culture.GetName] lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55100;Your Tribal vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has adopted Feudalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA55000;Civilized peasants..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55001;Sounds like a job for real men ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55002;Yes let us be one with our serfs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55003;We are indeed wise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55004;A most useful development;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55005;Sometimes I even surprise myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55006;Oh I say, game of cricket anyone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55010;[Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] customs are superior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55011;Troubling news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB55010;Never, I am still [Root.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
