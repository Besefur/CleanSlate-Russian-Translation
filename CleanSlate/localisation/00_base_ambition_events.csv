evt_ambition_001_desc_a;The art of leading men into battle has always fascinated you. To study this critical science, you have ordered the construction of a miniature army in wood. Dear [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] scoffs at you for playing with "toys," but truly, what do womenfolk know of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_002_desc_a;You have learned of other enthusiasts in [Root.Location.GetName] who share your interest in miniature armies and pitting them against each other in glorious battle. They will soon be holding a tournament to establish once and for all who the greatest general is. Perhaps you should grace them with your presence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_003_desc_a;You make your way to the small hovel where the gaming enthusiasts have gathered. Your bodyguards kick open the shack's ramshackle door and announce your presence to the bewildered peasant teenagers inside. They are already sitting around a table, in the midst of a battle with their own painted little armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_004_desc_a;As your armored guards stand at silent attention along the walls of the hut, you do battle with your wooden army. The dice do not roll your way, but at least you have gained several valuable tactical insights. With his miniature cavalry surrounding the last of your army, one of the trembling teenagers asks in a meek voice:\n "D-do you y-yield, m'lord?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_004_desc_b;As your armored guards stand at silent attention along the walls of the hut, you do battle with your wooden army. The dice roll your way and soon your army is the last to remain standing on the table. The frightened striplings watch in silence as you gather up your wooden soldiers and turn to leave with your bodyguard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_005_desc_a;As you make your way home late one night escorted by your bodyguard, you run into several drunken peasants having a fistfight in the middle of the street. Your guards attempt to steer you away, but you have an idea. Would this not be a perfect sparring opportunity in which to improve your martial ability?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_006_desc_a;After ordering your guards back, you join the wild melee. You get several blows in before the ruffians react to your presence, but things go poorly when you fight one of them on even terms. Soon you lie bruised in the mud, with the taste of blood in your mouth. Your smiling opponent offers his hand to help you up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_006_desc_b;After ordering your guards back, you join the wild melee. As the ruffians become aware of your presence they gang up on you, but you are still able to hold your own. You dodge their blows and land several of your own. Soon the peasants are lying unconscious at your feet in the mud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94010;It is rumored that a great warrior from the distant east is currently passing through [Root.Location.GetName]. He is said to have taken part in a hundred battles or more, and his legendary fighting skills are supposedly without peer. Perhaps he could be persuaded to pass on some of his knowledge to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94011;After a long search you find the fabled warrior you had been looking for at a local inn. Reeking of spirits, the old man is soundly asleep under a table. His sword is of an unfamiliar make and the man's appearance certainly betrays his eastern origins, but could this really be the legendary fighter you seek? The innkeeper will not let him leave until someone pays his bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94012;As the old man struggles to recover from his hangover, you explain, in a quiet voice, your quest to improve your martial ability. You ask if he would teach you. He breaks into laughter and winces from the headache this produces. Then it dawns on him that you aren't joking. "Very well, [Root.GetFirstName]-san. I promise teach, you promise learn. I say, you do, no questions.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94013;The old warrior from the east has settled down in your castle, and your training is proceeding well. One day as you walk into his room, you see the man trying to catch a fly with the pair of small wooden sticks he insists on using whenever he eats. You inquire why, and he explains: "Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94014;You take a boat trip with your old warrior teacher on a nearby lake. As he fishes, you stand up in the boat and practise the moves he has taught you. "When am I going to learn how to punch?" you ask. The man rocks the boat and you lose your footing, falling into the water. You resurface to his roaring laughter. "Learn how punch, after you learn how keep dry! You all wet behind ear!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94015;As dusk falls after an intense day of sparring, you watch the setting sun from the castle ramparts together with your warrior mentor. "I teach you many things, [Root.GetFirstName]-san," your mentor says, "but most important lesson in fight... is no get hit." The next morning, your training concluded, the old warrior has departed your castle. No one saw him leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94016;You have decided to join your personal guard in their daily training regimen at dawn. Things were a bit stiff at first, but when they realized you wouldn't have them beheaded for scoring hits on you with their wooden practise swords, they taught you many valuable lessons. Your martial skill has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94017;You have been studying the art of mounted combat under the tutelage of a skilled local horseman. The bruises you have incurred from falling off your horse will heal in time and they are a small price to pay for your increased horsemanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94018;History is a subject that has always fascinated you, and you have spent the last few weeks studying the campaigns of Alexander the Great. There are many lessons to be learned from his conquests in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94018_india;History is a subject that has always fascinated you, and you have spent the last few weeks studying the campaigns of Ashoka the Great. There are many lessons to be learned from his conquests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_94019;After many months studying the campaigns of Alexander the Great you have acquired many fascinating insights and gained new wisdom in military matters. You realize that the Art of War might be well worth studying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_94019_india;After spending many months studying the campaigns of Ashoka the Great you have gained some fascinating insights and acquired new wisdom in military matters. You realize that the Art of War might be well worth studying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94050;As you travel by carriage on a road in [Root.Location.GetName], you pass by what appears to be an old shuttered inn. The sight of it fills you with questions. What forced them to close down? Could you do a better job than the previous owners? Perhaps this would be a golden opportunity to improve your stewardship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94051;The vagrants in your new inn have been evicted, the holes in the roof have been patched and the whole building has been thoroughly aired out to cleanse it of the most offensive odors. New staff has been hired, and the time has come for you to decide on a name for your inn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94052;Things are very busy at your new inn, with everyone preparing for the grand opening night. Guests will be able to sample turnips for free, but if you added a generous amount of salt to them, people might become more thirsty and mead sales would increase...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94053;Your inn will soon open to the public, but one last detail demands your attention before the opening night. Some form of act or spectable will need to be booked to keep the guests around. After scouring the lands for what passes for entertainment, you conclude that the following options are available to you:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94054;Probably not your brightest idea, but you invite the clergyman to speak at the grand opening of your inn. He conducted a sermon on the importance of leading a righteous and temperate life. The sermon lasted for some time, until the clergyman was too drunk to remain coherent... or stand upright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94055;The bard you hired for your inn's opening night was from far away and spoke a peculiar language, yet despite this there was a strangely compelling elegance and rythm to his poetry and song. At least people seemed to think so. Sales were good, so you see no reason to complain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94056;The eunuch's castrato singing was quite unlike anything you had heard before, but unfortunately a large fight errupted near the stage as people crowded around it to see where the shrill wailing was coming from. Your ears are still ringing from the singer's high-pitched shrieks when the fighting spilled onto the stage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94057;The wild ass sat on the grand stage of your inn for the better part of an hour, and although it relieved itself twice on the wooden floor, no speech or poetry was forthcoming. To your horror, the agitated animal then ran amok amongst the audience, resulting in fleeing customers and four broken tables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94058;Well, that was a disaster. The people who sampled your turnips suffered violent bouts of illness, and the rest cleared out in short order after the first guests hurled their stomach contents on your floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94059;The salt trick actually seems to have worked! Who would have thought? The thirst of your guests seemed unquenchable and mead sales exceeded expections!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94060;The opening night of your inn has concluded, and the time has come for you to move on from this venture and resume your other duties. Whatever else can be said, you have learned many valuable lessons on running a business. A buyer is ready to take the inn off your hands, at a tidy little profit for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94065;It has been brought to your attention that the large garden outside your castle is, frankly, a mess. Last week one of your courtiers got lost in that wilderness, and the man did not emerge for two days. Tackling this garden problem head on could be an excellent project with which to improve your stewardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94066;Together with your gardeners, you have redesigned your castle garden into a more managable form. You have organized the digging of a small canal system to keep your plants watered, the weeds have been removed and the hedge maze now actually has an exit. The skeletal remains strewn about the maze's dead ends have also been cleared out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94070;To improve your stewardship and better learn how to administrate a realm, it strikes you that it might be a good idea to conduct a survey of the land. Trustworthy men would have to be sent out to every corner of your domains and record their findings. This information will then be collected into a single, great tome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94071;The men you sent out to survey the land have returned. You now have a precise count of the households, down to how many cows they own. This was a wise initiative, and your stewardship ability has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94072;Bookkeeping is an unappreciated art, and you have taken it upon yourself to master it. You have gained a clearer picture of the realm's finances and your stewardship has improved as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94073;An important part of ruling a realm is learning how to delegate. This is something you have finally realized, and your stewardship has improved as a direct consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94074;Managing the large staff of servants in your castle is in many ways like managing a small realm. There are many duties to be performed, and getting things to run smoothly is a true challenge. You have spent some time reorganizing your household, and your stewardship has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94080;As you watch some birds darting nimbly through the air, you find yourself wondering why it is that man cannot do the same. There have been unsuccessful attempts to make flying contraptions in the past, but clearly those designs were all conceived by fools. Building a machine that can fly will help improve your learning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94081;In your quest to build a flying machine, you spend countless hours with dusty old tomes and parchments in an effort to learn about all the failed attempts to fly, lest you repeat their mistakes. You are finally at the point where you feel you have learned enough to begin construction of a prototype.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94082;The prototype of your flying machine is nearing completion, but it would probably be ill-advised to pilot the thing yourself on its maiden flight. Fortunately, you know of several promising candidates who could probably be persuaded to take this historic leap of faith on your behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94083;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. Otis agrees to be strapped into the contraption, especially after you bribe him with sweets. You give him a gentle push over the cliff and leave the rest to fate and the wind. He plummets down like a sack of stones, trailing debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94084;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. Meldrick hesitates, but after a combination of threats and cajoling he agrees to be strapped into the contraption. You push him over the cliff and hope for the best. He plummets down like a sack of stones, trailing debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94085;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. Before you can strap the dog into the contraption, the furious blacksmith, an ogre of a man, approaches with his crying daughter. You quickly decide to take the dog's place. As you dive off the cliff, the machine disintegrates around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94086;After carefully examining the wreckage of your flying machine, you conclude that the physique of Otis was simply too much for its delicate frame to bear. At any rate, the ungrateful boy now refuses to have anything to do with your machines. It looks like you will have to fly the next prototype yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94087;Meldrick is bruised and battered, but alive. Your flying machine was a failure, and to make matters worse, another scholar in [Root.Location.GetName] has allegedly made his own functioning prototype. Just as you are about to surrender to despair, Meldrick gives you a toothless smile and says: "I have a cunning plan.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94088;As you lie in your bedchamber, bruised and battered but still alive, you contemplate the nature of your plummet from the cliff. Your flying machine has been destroyed and you may never see a human soaring through the air, but this experience has taught you much about the value of science and scholarly research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94089;With a new and improved flying machine, you return to the cliff. Otis waits below, as you will take the fateful plunge yourself this time. You close your eyes and leap into the air from the cliff. For a few seconds you feel the wind rushing past your face until something soft breaks your fall. It is Otis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94090;How he did it will forever remain a mystery, but Meldrick has managed to steal the rival scholar's flying machine. He gleefully brings it to the cliff, but his grin vanishes when you inform him he will be flying again. You send him over the cliff and Meldrick enters a brief, spiraling dive before slamming into the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94091;Despite your efforts, it seems the secrets of flight will have to be uncovered by future generations. Your attempts may have been unsuccessful, but you have learned much about the value of science and scholarly research. Your learning has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94092;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. al-Otis agrees to be strapped into the contraption, especially after you bribe him with sweets. You give him a gentle push over the cliff and leave the rest to fate and the wind. He plummets down like a sack of stones, trailing debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94093;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. Ba'ah al-Drik hesitates, but after a combination of threats and cajoling he agrees to be strapped into the contraption. You push him over the cliff and hope for the best. He plummets down like a sack of stones, trailing debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94094;After carefully examining the wreckage of your flying machine, you conclude that the physique of al-Otis was simply too much for its delicate frame to bear. At any rate, the ungrateful boy now refuses to have anything to do with your machines. It looks like you will have to fly the next prototype yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94095;Ba'ah al-Drik is bruised and battered, but alive. Your flying machine was a failure, and to make matters worse, another scholar in [Root.Location.GetName] has allegedly made his own functioning prototype. Just as you are about to surrender to despair, Ba'ah al-Drik gives you a toothless smile and says: "I have a cunning plan.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94096;With a new and improved flying machine, you return to the cliff. al-Otis waits below, as you will take the fateful plunge yourself this time. You close your eyes and leap into the air from the cliff. For a few seconds you feel the wind rushing past your face until something soft breaks your fall. It is al-Otis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94097;How he did it will forever remain a mystery, but Ba'ah al-Drik has managed to steal the rival scholar's flying machine. He gleefully brings it to the cliff, but his grin vanishes when you inform him he will be flying again. You send him over the cliff and Ba'ah al-Drik enters a brief, spiraling dive before slamming into the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94098;You have come into possession of "The Confessions of St. Augustine," a series of tomes detailing the life and times of Augustine of Hippo, a Christian theologian from Roman Africa who lived many centuries ago. Studying this historical work could provide insights that improve your learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94099;At last, you have finished your studies of St. Augustine's Confessions. It took many nights of reading with only the light of a candle to keep you company, but you do not regret a second of it. Your learning has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94100;You have come into possession of the Shahnameh, an epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. It chronicles the history of Persia, telling the stories of its early kings up until the Arab conquest and the spread of Islam. Studying this historical work could provide insights that improve your learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94101;At last, you have finished your studies of the Shahnameh. It took many nights of reading with only the light of a candle to keep you company, but you do not regret a second of it. Your learning has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94102;There is an old hermit somewhere in the back country of [Root.Capital.GetName] who is said to possess great wisdom as well as a razor-sharp wit. Some claim he once served in the clergy, others say he was a mercenary captain who decided to put down his arms for good. Whatever his past, many seek him out for counsel. Will you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94103;With a mule as your only company, you depart for the hermit's cave. The journey is long and the roads, where they exist at all, are in poor condition. Finally, after reaching the end of a narrow mountain path, you come upon the cave. A ragged piece of cloth is all that shields the entrance from the outside elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94104;The cloth parts slightly to reveal the face of a gnarled old man. He regards you in silence for a moment with his beady eyes, then disappears behind the cloth again. "No solicitors!" he shouts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94105;You push the curtain aside and enter the dark cave. Deep inside you find the hermit, seated on a cushion in flickering candlelight. He seems to be in some kind of trance at first, but then he opens an eye and looks at you with mild annoyance. "I thought I said... oh, spit it out then! What do you want?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94106;After much badgering, the old man finally relents and permits you to stay for a few days. You observe him carefully and learn as much as you can. In the end, his "wisdom" seems limited to an endless stream of platitudes and maxims. You have memorized many, and at least they will make you seem more learned in the eyes of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94107;Much knowledge has been lost since the glory days of the Roman Empire, but some of their engineering knowledge has been preserved in dusty, old tomes for posterity. You have spent several days studying a few of these, and your learning has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94108;Philosophy is not quite as popular these days as it was in classical antiquity, but you have found an old scholar who is willing to share his knowledge with you. Under his tutelage, you study the works of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and other philosophical giants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94109;The heavens can teach us much, and you have been engrossed in the science of astronomy for the past several days. You have learned the names of the celestial bodies and the various constellations, and how to use the stars for navigation. Your learning has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94110;There are two peasant families in [Root.Capital.GetName] who have been locked in a bitter feud for generations. This conflict has now escalated to the point where it is even discussed in circles of nobility. Although this feud would normally be far beneath your notice, this could be a golden opportunity to practise your diplomacy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94111;You have invited the two feuding families to a local inn hoping to reach some kind of agreement. The peasants are seated at two opposing tables on either side of your position in the middle. Some have brought pitchforks, one clutches a live chicken, and all of them look moderately inbred. This could be a challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94112;"This petty feud cannot continue," you begin. "What do you suppose would happen if the great noble houses fought each other as you do, instead of working together for the common good? You must learn from our shining example and - ";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94113;"My friends," you say with as warm a smile as you can muster. "I think you know why I have called your great families here. As you suffer from this tragic conflict, the entire realm suffers with you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94114;"As some of you may know, my parentage has often been put into question," you start, rising from your seat. "There have been cruel whispers labeling me an 'inbred freak.' I know that many of you here have suffered the same injustices, and I come to you now as an understanding friend.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94115;You continue, in a harsher voice: "But at the same time, you have a duty and a responsibility to the crown! You fight each other on the street, and we look away. You ruin entire harvests for each other, and we look away. Not again. The line must be drawn here! This far, no furth - ";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94116;In a firm but kind voice, you say: "Many of you are angry, I know. You have every reason to be. Too much blood has been spilled between your families for things to be smoothed over, but there comes a time when one has to look to the future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94117;For dramatic effect, you pull out a dagger and stab it into the table with all your might. "Because if you do not, I can assure you that there will BE no future for your families! I will personally hunt down every single one of you, and make sure that - ";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94118;You thump your fist on the table for dramatic effect. "In the end, are we not all adults here? It is so easy to resort to the bickering of children, for nobility and commoners alike, but that is when we must find the inner strength to rise above such pettiness! Let us walk out of here as the adults we are! What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94119;You barely have time to dodge the chicken someone hurls your way. With a howl the two families leap over their tables and throw themselves at each other with you caught in the middle. Clothes torn and covered in bruises, you eventually manage to crawl out of the inn as the fighting continues inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94120;Though it is doubtful whether they understood half of what you said, most of your message seems to have carried over. The peasants give a rousing applause. Crying members from the two families hug each other, and at least two marriages between their bloodlines are agreed upon on the spot. It seems the feud is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94125;If you want to improve your skill at diplomacy, you need to become a confident public speaker. Swaying the hearts and minds of men with simple words is not an easy thing, but you have started practising in front of a mirror. Things can only improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94126;Your hard work practising public speaking in front of a mirror has paid off! You now feel much more confident when addressing others, and your skill at the art of diplomacy has likewise improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94130;You are drawn to a large cheerful crowd standing in front of a tall building in [Root.Location.GetName]. It seems they have gathered to watch the antics of a man who has climbed onto the building's roof. The despairing man, tired of the hardships of life, is threatening to jump and several of the onlookers are goading him on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94131;You hurry inside the building and join the desperate man on the roof. "No! Stay away!" he cries when he sees you. You slowly climb out on the ledge next to him. "I just want to talk," you say as you edge closer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94132;You quickly reach out and manage to grab the man's wrist before he has a chance to jump. "Let me go, you cretin!" he screams. "I don't care who you are, you have no right to stop me from departing this wretched world!" Far below, you notice that some peasants have gathered a haystack to cushion the fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94133;A glint of madness flashes in your eyes and you smile at the man. "Do you really want to jump? Fine! Then we jump!" The man gapes at you, dumbfounded. "You... you're insane!" he gasps. Before the man can change his mind, you leap off the building and pull him with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94134;You land safely together in the haystack. "Let's go again!" you exclaim as you brush the hay off your clothes. The shocked suicidal man pulls his arm away from you, and stumbles towards the crowd. "Get away from me! Help! That [Root.GetManWoman] tried to kill me, [Root.GetSheHe]'s insane!" As you walk away, you feel your grasp of diplomacy has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94135;Mustering all your strength, you forcefully pull the man back to safety where he can be subdued by members of the city guard. He curses your name as he is dragged off to the dungeons - trying to take one's life is a sin, after all. You have learned the valuable lesson that sometimes actions speak louder than words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94136;You speak gently with the distressed man, as if addressing a child. While keeping a safe distance so as not to alarm him, you lecture him at length about the wonders of life. You follow this with several long-winded anecdotes from your own life, including important moral lessons at the end. The man jumps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94137;You speak gently with the man, addressing him as an equal and a friend. As you talk, you carefully guide the conversation and subtly make him realize the folly of ending his life. To the crowd's dismay, he agrees to come down with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94138;There is a talented town crier in [Root.Location.GetName] who seems able to capture the attention of the peasant rabble in an instant with his commanding voice. You have studied his methods and the pitch of his voice closely, and you expect to do better the next time you have to address a large crowd of people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94139;You have spent some time immersed in tomes describing the various cultures surrounding your realm. Though some of what you learned seems suspect, you have still obtained a better understanding in how to approach foreigners. Your diplomatic ability has improved as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94140;A local dignitary is visiting together with his pretty young wife. She wears a shining necklace, apparently some kind of priceless family heirloom. While he prattles on, your mind begins to wander. Suppose the bauble was to disappear? This could prove an excellent opportunity to better your skill at intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94141;As night falls, you sneak into the guest room and carefully remove the heirloom from the neck of the dignitary's sleeping wife. She stirs slightly in her sleep, but does not wake. Now that you have the necklace, a worthless gewgaw, you need to decide where to plant it. Who shall take the blame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94142;You stealthfully place the necklace in the kitchen, where the cook's wife is sure to find it. Perhaps the poor woman will think it a gift from her husband... or a particularly generous pixie. With your work done, you retire for the night to see what will happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94143;The loud wailing coming from the guest room informs you that your little theft has been discovered. The dignitary and his wife are both unconsolable, and their grief over the missing necklace knows no bounds. Before they leave, you offer them a meal in the dining room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94144;The cook's wife serves the soup while the dignitary describes, in detail, how the necklace has passed from generation to generation in his family. Suddenly his wife emits a shrill cry and points at the massive wrist of the cook's wife. She is wearing the missing necklace as a bracelet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94145;After the necklace has been returned, the affronted dignitary and his wife soon depart. The cook's wife will have to endure a brief spell in the dungeons, but for a good cause - you have learned some valuable lessons in the art of manipulating events to your liking. Your skill at intrigue has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94146;You suddenly wake up in cold sweat. The cook's wife! You had her imprisoned for the supposed theft of a necklace all those years ago... but you forgot to let her out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94147;You are too late. The jailor explains that she passed away in a dark corner of her cell several years ago from the plague. Her remains were dumped together with the countless other thieves and cutthroats who perished in the same epidemic. This might explain why you caught your cook spitting in your stew the other day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94148;The jailor leads you to an especially dark and damp corner of the dungeon. He unlocks a rusty door to reveal an extremely thin and famished old woman. She looks up at you with frightened eyes and only then do you recognize her as the cook's formerly overweight wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94149;Disguised by a simple cowl, you present the necklace to your dung gathering servant, claiming it is a gift from a secret admirer. He is delighted, saying it will go well with the dirty rags he wears as clothes. With your work done, you retire for the night to see what will happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94150;The loud wailing coming from the guest room informs you that your little theft has been discovered. The dignitary and his wife are both unconsolable, and their grief over the missing necklace knows no bounds. As they prepare to leave your household, you call on your servant to bring their luggage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94151;Your servant dumps the luggage in front of the dignitary's carriage, but as he turns to leave, the dignitary's wife emits a shrill cry. She points at the shining heirloom around the servant's filthy neck. He gives her a toothless smile. "D'you like it, m'lady? 'Tis from a secret admirer, it is.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94152;After the necklace has been returned, the affronted dignitary and his wife soon depart. Your dung gathering servant will have to endure a brief spell in the dungeons, but for a good cause - you have learned some valuable lessons in the art of manipulating events to your liking. Your skill at intrigue has increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94153;You suddenly wake up in cold sweat. The dung gatherer! You had him imprisoned for the supposed theft of a necklace all those years ago... but you forgot to let him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94154;You are too late. The jailor explains that he passed away in a dark corner of his cell several years ago from the plague. His remains were dumped together with the countless other thieves and cutthroats who perished in the same epidemic. You had been wondering about all that ungathered dung laying about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94155;The jailor leads you to an especially dark and damp corner of the dungeon. He unlocks a rusty door to reveal a disgusting ghoul. An unholy smell washes over you as you look at the tiny, clammy, hairy creature that lies before you. Your formerly dung gathering servant looks up at you with a toothless smile. "M'lord?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94156;An old weather-bitten diplomat who has served in most of the courts in Europe ("the ones that mattered at least") agreed to take you under his wing for a few days. He has taught you many valuable tricks in how to deal with vassals and other rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94160;It dawns on you one day that there is plenty of intrigue happening right under your nose. Your servants, from the kitchen maids to the stable boys, share juicy gossip with each other on a daily basis. If you want to improve at this twisted game of manipulation and deceit, then perhaps you ought to dive in and join the prattle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94161;Taking part in the gossip sessions of your servants has proved an enlightening experience. Not only have you learned of new ways to obtain sensitive information, but also that one of the milk maids is secretly carrying the blacksmith's unborn child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94165;By chance, you have learned that an old tailor in [Root.Location.GetName] once worked as spymaster for a local nobleman many years ago. The stories of his deeds and exploits are the stuff of legends. If even half of it is true, then this man could surely teach you a thing or two about intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94166;As you visit the tailor in his modest shop, the harmless-looking little man feigns ignorance and for a moment you wonder if you have the wrong person. He kindly turns to fetch you some tea, but then suddenly, before you can react, he is standing behind you with a knife at your throat. "Who sent you?" he hisses into your ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94167;After questioning you, the old man is finally satisfied that you're not there to kill him. He grudgingly agrees to teach you some of his tricks, if you promise to keep the secret of his past to yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94168;You have studied long and hard under the old spymaster in your sparetime, and he has taught you much about the game of cloak and dagger. Your intrigue has improved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94169;You have been studying alchemy recently, for the sole purpose of learning everything you can about poisons. You have learned the answers to important questions such as which poisons are the most potent, which are the most difficult to detect and how best to guard against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94170;Your dynasty has become renowned for its decadence and the common folk view you with disdain. As a gesture to show them that you remember your ancient roots, perhaps you should leave the luxuries of your palace behind for a few days and spend some time with the desert nomads?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94171;You spend a few days in the deep desert with a Berber tribe. These are poor and simple folk, but their knowledge of the land and how to live off it impresses you. They treat you as one of their own, and when you finally return to your palace with your face and robe caked in dust, you have a newfound respect for these warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94172;Assassins are a constant danger that every ruler may have to face. To prepare, you have decided to expand the size of your personal bodyguard. Any would-be [Root.GetTitle]-slayer will have to fight through them first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94173;You have hired an old assassin to teach you how best to thwart the efforts of his kind. He has taught you several valuable lessons, like never sitting with your back towards a door and to never stay long in an inn that smells of manure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94175;A group of vicious highwaymen have been preying on travellers in [Root.Location.GetName]. Your scouts have discovered the location of their camp, but if you march an army towards them they will disperse long before it arrives. A small band of hand-picked warriors personally led by you might stand a better chance of capturing their leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94176;You select twelve of the bravest and most capable men from your personal levies. Together you set off towards the bandit camp and approach it under the cover of darkness. Their leader, a big one-eyed brute of a man, sits at a campfire with his lieutenants and is dividing up the spoils of their latest raid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94177;Your men storm the bandit camp and cut down the startled highwaymen in droves. Their leader proves to be a capable fighter, and two of your men have their skulls cleaved by his massive axe. As the wild melee continues on all sides, you and the leader are seperated from the others and face each other in single combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94178;The fight was hard and the bandit leader's axe came close to splitting your head more than once. In the end, you managed to dig your blade into his unprotected flank and the brute was felled. The rest of the bandits were killed or rounded up by your men, and they will plague travellers no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94180;There is a legend amongst the peasant folk of a two-headed albino dromedary stalking the desert sands after night has fallen. Their name for the beast is "Adh-Dhi'ban" - The Two Jackals. Organising a hunt for this unholy creature and mounting its two heads on your wall would make your dynasty seem less decadent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94181;You set out into the desert together with a local guide. He warns you that a mere gaze from the beast's four eyes has been enough to drive men mad in the past. You tell him not to worry, for you intend to pluck the creature's eyes from out of their sockets, and then boil and eat them. The guide looks queasy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94182;The search proves fruitless. At one point you thought you had found an even more twisted creature. Although not albino, this dromedary possessed not only two heads, but two bodies as well! Your guide then pointed out that it was two dromedaries standing next to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94183;The beast does not exist. Days of search has proven as much. You briefly contemplate taking the heads of two ordinary dromedaries and painting them white, but in the end decide it would be too much work. You and your guide head for home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94184;To your surprise, when you and your guide return you are both hailed as heroes by the populace. They claim your courageous hunt drove the evil Adh-Dhi'ban away from the mortal realm for good. Men and women may now tread safely in the desert at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94185;You have dispatched couriers to every corner of your realm, who will sing the praises of your dynasty and speak of its great deeds. Hopefully this will make it seem less decadent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94186;The decadence of your dynasty has become a problem, and in an effort to root it out you have decided to strip your palace of unnecessary luxuries. This should bring you closer to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC94187;You have ordered your men to close down all the brothels in [Root.Location.GetName]. No exceptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_ambition_001_opt_a;Forward, men! We shall fight to the last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_002_opt_a;Yes! My armies will crush all opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_003_opt_a;Right then. Who will face me first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_004_opt_a;Yield? YIELD?! Guards, take this wretch to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_004_opt_c;We shall have to do this again some time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_005_opt_a;Put 'em up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_006_opt_a;Guards, deal with them! No survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_006_opt_c;Thank you for this dance, gentlemen, but I must be off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94010;This man must be found!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94011;Just another drunken fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94012;You have a deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94013;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94014;That's it, old man! I've had it with you! We're done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94015;Well, I suppose I learned something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94016;Parry, Riposte!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94017;Giddyup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94018;Perhaps I, too, will march east some day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_94019;I shall be a master of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94050;It is settled! I will buy the inn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94051;The Bottomless Tankard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94052;Add 10% salt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94053;A lengthy sermon on the evils of vices by a local clergyman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94054;Sales actually improved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94055;Keep the mead flowing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94056;At least the singing is over now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94057;They... they told me it spoke! I swear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94058;Too much salt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94059;I made a nice little profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94060;It was nice while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94065;Time to stretch those green fingers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94066;Hard but rewarding work. I have learned much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94070;Let us write this tome of judgment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94071;The [Root.GetTitle] sees all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94072;I could do this all day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94073;Things run more smoothly now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94074;Remember, breakfast is served at eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94080;Yes! I am sure it can be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94081;I will rule the skies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94082;Otis, the cook's overweight son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94083;Otis? Move your leg if you are still alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94084;M-Meldrick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94085;AAAAHHHhhhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94086;I do this for the betterment of mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94087;I will regret this, but let's hear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94088;Per ardua ad astra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94089;I was flying! Otis, did you see? ...Otis?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94090;So it wasn't just my machine... I feel better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94091;I'la' al-a'la fi sabil al-magd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94092;al-Otis? Move your leg if you are still alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94093;Ba'ah al-Drik?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94096;I was flying! al-Otis, did you see? ...al-Otis?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94098;I will read every word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94099;This work contained many truths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94102;I shall find this hermit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94103;Old man, show yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94104;I have travelled far, old man! I will not be denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94105;I hope to share in your wisdom. May I stay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94106;"Semper ubi sub ubi ubique.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94107;They were a clever bunch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94108;I know that I know nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94109;So it's just a comet, not an omen of the end times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94110;I will put an end to this squabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94111;Appeal to their sense of reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94112;The peasants shout you down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94113;Mention their patriotic duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94116;Threaten them with violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94118;The peasants stand up in unison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94119;Well, I did my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94120;Well, that went better than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94125;You talking to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94126;Countrymen, lend me your ears!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94130;Don't do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94131;Grab the man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94132;Jump with the man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94133;Look out below!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94134;Mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94135;This applies to many situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94136;Well, at least I have learned what works and what doesn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94137;I too have learned from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94138;Hear ye, hear ye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94139;Things would be simpler if everyone was [Root.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94140;Stage the theft of the necklace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94141;Magda, the cook's overweight wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94142;This will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94143;Magda, bring us some soup, please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94144;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94145;All's well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94146;M-Magda! Quick, to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94147;Well, there's not much I can do about it now, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94148;Why, Magda! You've... lost weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94149;This will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94150;Meldrick, bring down their belongings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94151;Guards, seize him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94152;All's well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94153;M-Meldrick! Quick, to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94154;Well, there's not much I can do about it now, is there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94155;Meldrick? On second thought, jailor, close that door...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94156;Much obliged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94160;Said and done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94161;Oh, the scandal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94165;I will seek him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94166;N-no one! I only wish to learn from you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94167;Agreed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94168;I do not fear the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94169;This knowledge may save my life one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94170;Yes... for a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94171;Time well spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94172;They shall follow me everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94173;These lessons will prolong my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94175;Yes, I will show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94176;Charge!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94177;L-Let's not be hasty! We can talk this over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94178;A job well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94180;A worthy quest. Let us slay this affront to nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94181;Let us not dally. Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94182;We waste time! That beast must be here somewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94183;This was an unproductive trip...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94184;Well... of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94185;I should hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94186;The wine fountain will be missed, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA94187;This decadence must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

evt_ambition_002_opt_b;No, I have no time to waste on silly games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_004_opt_b;I yield. Well fought, boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_005_opt_b;No, these peasants are beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evt_ambition_006_opt_b;Thank you for the lesson, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94011;I will pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94012;No way, old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94014;Sigh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_94018;Perhaps I, too, could achieve such greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_94019;There are other things in life as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94050;No, I will not sink any money into that ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94051;The Mead Fountain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94052;Add 20% salt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94053;A travelling bard from distant lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94065;No, gardening is for weaklings and the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94070;No, I fear it would be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94080;No, we belong with our feet planted firmly on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94082;Meldrick, local dung gatherer and dogsbody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94086;No, that thing is clearly a deathtrap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94087;Then keep it to yourself, nitwit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94098;No... not enough pictures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94102;Me, take advice from a decrepit old man? Hardly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94104;Oh well. I'll be off again then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94110;No, let the riff-raff sort out their own problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94111;Flatter them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94113;Soothe their tempers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94116;Lambast their childish behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94130;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94131;Talk to the man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94132;Pull the man inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94140;No, it would be too cruel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94141;Meldrick, local dung gatherer and dogsbody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94143;Wafaa, bring us some soup, please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB94155;Ba'ah al-Drik? On second thought, jailor, close that door...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94160;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94165;No, this man sounds dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94170;No, I refuse to live in filth and squalor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94175;I will not risk my neck to fight bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94176;This was a bad idea. Let's go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94177;My, I can't wait to see your head impaled on a spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94178;Help me with this head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB94180;I have not the stomach to face such a creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_94018;I should devote more time to studying this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_94019;I'll use this knowledge to my advantage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC94051;The Jester's Choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
