EVTDESC_RIP_10001;Our people in [plague_outbreak_location.GetName] are suffering from a frightening epidemic. Those afflicted by the disease display large buboes and high fever before vomiting blood and dying, some in the middle of the streets, healthy only a few days earlier. Dread is spreading, seeping into the heart of the realm while our healers are at a loss - there is no cure to the horror wreaking havoc among the populace. The cause of the disease is unknown and those trying to protect themselves are left to their own devices. Bodies are piling up, ridden with black and rotting limbs... The plague is at our doorstep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10002;We have received news of an epidemic in [plague_outbreak_location.Realm.GetName]. The information is vague, but word is people are dying like flies and the fear of the disease is spreading as fast as the affliction itself. Furthermore, the condition is reported irreversible as well as incurable, and the scattered records of the events are worrisome. With no source of evil revealed people are turning to their gods and on each other, to protect themselves from contagion. Many call it a new plague.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10003;We have received news of a horrible epidemic in [plague_outbreak_location.GetName], part of [plague_outbreak_location.Realm.GetName]. At first the rumors were thought to be exaggerated, but ever since the disorderly arrival of inconsolable refugees at our gates, it has been difficult to ignore what is happening. They tell of various symptoms, and our couriers from the area report seeing large buboes, people vomiting blood before dying, while others have their extremities turn black, rotting off their bodies. Terror is spreading as rapidly as the disease and so far there has been no mention of a cure... Only mass graves. Is this the will of [This.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10006;Mobs of new people are arriving in [bordering_province.GetName]. Most of the newly arrived are commoners fleeing the plague that has reached [infected_province.GetName] just beyond the borders of our realm. Some have lost their whole families, some are trying to protect theirs and a few are travelers or merchants that had an easier time moving. All of them seem to have witnessed indescribable horrors, hardly any will talk about it at all. The ones that do talk, warn others of the coming plague and urge them stay inside or pack their things and flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10015;The Plague has spread across India, from the north river plains to the southernmost tip of Kanyakumari. While the people sought refuge in the temples at first, now they too lay deserted, only corpses bowing before the gods. Bodies bloated beyond recognition float down the Ganges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10016;The trade routes of the east have become less traveled, as reports of the Plague spreading in the Persian expanse have increased in frequency. Entire villages are gone from the world of the living, disregarding the wealth and good harvests the area was enjoying. The reality is stark, as death continues to spread and despair paves its road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10017;An ominous shadow looms over the regions of the Middle East as the Plague has left little but tragedy in its wake. The reports are scarce, but upon hearing the tales of lone refugees walking the roads, often the sole survivor of a family, the hearts of many are torn as to why [This.Religion.GetHighGodName] would allow this to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10018;Death is haunting the continent of Africa as the Plague is spreading among its inhabitants. Blackened bodies lay rotting in the sun and the stench is unbearable. Many have fled the larger settlements but the epidemic follows with the bodies floating down the Nile and the Niger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10019;The atmosphere at court has grown tense, as word of the Plague raging in Asia Minor has reached you. To further disturb the people a story is circulating - survivors speak of a cursed ship, carrying living corpses come to recruit for their captain of death... The myth is lent more credibility each time a coastal city succumbs to the epidemic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10020;Death comes to all, and in Eastern Europe the terror is becoming mundane. The Plague has been ravishing the lands, unbiased regarding the social status of men, indifferently claiming even babies from the arms of their parents. Travels to the area are currently discouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10021;Panic is rising as the Plague reaps its victims across Southern Europe. Peasants and nobles alike have gathered in the churches to pray for mercy from their God. As even the great Rome has become littered with corpses, many fear that the taint is sent by Him as punishment for the people's sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10022;From the Rock of Gibraltar to the ports of London the Plague has been spreading, harvesting lives of nobles and farmers alike. The countryside of the afflicted areas have been left haunting and desolate. Here and there pyres, from the burning of the diseased, can be seen from miles away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10023;Not even the most remote regions of the world are safe â€“ the Plague has struck northern Europe. The streets of many cities lay deserted as their inhabitants have fled in fear. Despite the heavy quarantine in the harbors, many a ghost ship eerily drift across the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10024;No one is safe as the Plague claims its victims across the Steppes. Trade is suffering as the affliction spreads across the northern route of the Silk Road. The tribes are riding into the wilderness, desperately trying to escape the epidemic. Trails of dead bodies mark their passing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
