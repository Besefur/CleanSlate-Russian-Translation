EVTDESC_WoL_4000;Dear [Root.GetFirstName],\nI would like to invite you to join me for a small gathering of friends, to dine and drink and forget about the world outside for a little while. Please be prepared to reserve a few days for this, in case we get truly into the spirit of the proceedings.\n\nYours,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4001;Dear [GetFromReverseRelation],\n\nOf course I will come feast with you. I will bring my best appetite for revelry!\n\nYours,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4002;Dear [GetFromReverseRelation],\n\nUnfortunately I cannot join you for merrymaking at this time. But thank you for your kind invitation.\n\nUntil next time,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4003;Dear [GetFromReverseRelation],\n\nIt saddens me that you have turned into such a decadent wretch. Surely, [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is laughing at your escapades but I for my part refuse to partake in them.\n\nIn hope of your eventual redemption,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4011;Unfortunate circumstances have forced me to cancel the bout of carousing that I had planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4012;Dear [GetFromReverseRelation],\n\nUnfortunate circumstances force me to cancel the bout of carousing and merrymaking that we had planned. We will have to make up for it when times are happier.\n\nUntil then,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4015;No one accepted my inviation to carousing. One person makes no feast, so I will have to postpone it for later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4030;My guests have arrived for the private feast I have arranged. It's time to let the carousing and merriment begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4031;I have arrived at the private rooms of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. There is plenty of food and drink here, and the mood is decidedly merry. I am looking forward to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4101;Late into the third day of feasting, I sit awake, alone, contemplating the revelries. Next to me on a couch lies one of my companions, sleeping a deep drunken sleep, defenseless and beautiful, skin glowing in the candlelight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4111;Several days of feasting together, the attraction is growing, and I know we're thinking of the same thing here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4112;Several days of feasting together, and I have many times caught [From.GetFirstName] looking at me in that 'special' way. Finally, after a late cup of wine, [From.GetSheHe] puts [From.GetHerHis] arms around me and whispers a delicious proposal in my ear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4113;[From.GetFirstName] acceded to my advances, and we spend the rest of the night together, enjoying each other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4114;[From.GetFirstName] declined my amorous advances. I excuse myself, then return to the pleasures of the table. Soon, the embarrassing moment is forgotten... almost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4120;These days of revelry are an excellent escape. So many laughs and so many intense conversations in such short a time... It brings me closer to my companions, I feel like good friends already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4131;Is it the drink? Is it something someone said? I don't remember, honestly, but someone has to pay! Fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4132;Good drinks and food, carousing, everything is fine. Or was fine, until [From.GetTitledFirstName] unexpectedly threw a fit of rage. I'm not sure why, but [From.GetSheHe]'s coming at me right now with [From.GetHerHis] fists up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4133_fight;[From.GetTitledFirstName] put up a good fight, in spite of being just as inebriated as I. After a while we were both exhausted and had to call it a draw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4133_hide;At the last moment, [From.GetSheHe] ran out, after throwing a chair at me and making me stumble. I searched everywhere but couldn't find [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4133_talk;[From.GetTitledFirstName] started speaking to me calmly, explaining that there was no need to be upset. I considered it for a moment, and then realized that [From.GetSheHe] was right. We ended up sitting down to eat and drink together again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4141;This party needs some action! I'm going to get undressed. Then perhaps, yes, I'll bring some animals in here, and maybe, yes that spear. And, and... set fire to the table, roast the food over it, then... where are my pants? Oh, right, I took them off! What now, hahaha, there you are, oh, ouch!! I just sat on the spear, how... amusing. I don't know, why is everybody laughing - this is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4142;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is feasting and reveling like a lunatic. I can hardly stand up, I am laughing so hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4151;We're having a great time carousing. My comrades say I should slow down on the drink, but that's all nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4152_drunkard;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is drinking like a champion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4152_non_drunkard;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly going overboard with [From.GetHerHis] drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4161_gamer;It's great to spend time carousing and frolicking in good company. I feel great, absolutely great, and that means the time has come to bring out the old game board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4161_non_gamer;It's great to spend time carousing in merry company. While the cups are being refilled, [From.GetTitledFirstName] brings out a strange board with little decorated pieces, explaining that it's a kind of strategy game. [From.GetSheHeCap] assures me that it's a great pastime that combines well with copious amounts of drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4162_money_i_suggest;I suggested to [From.GetTitledFirstName] that we bring out the board and pieces to play and see who is the better strategist. [From.GetSheHeCap] has accepted, on the condition that we play for money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4162_money_they_suggest;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has brought out the board and pieces and suggests that we play a few rounds to determine who is the better strategist. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that we play for money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4162_not_money_i_suggest;I suggested to [From.GetTitledFirstName] that we bring out the board and pieces to play and see who's the better strategist. [From.GetSheHeCap] accepted, insisting that we play for honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4162_not_money_they_suggest;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has brought out the board and pieces and suggests that we play a few rounds to determine who is the better strategist. We will play for honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4163_loss;We played for hours, the tides of fortune ebbing and flowing as I tried to attack my opponent's positions without opening my defense too much. Eventually, however, I made a fatal mistake that my opponent exploited, and I lost the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4163_win;We played for hours, the tides of fortune ebbing and flowing as I tried to attack my opponent's positions without opening my defense too much. Eventually, I found a critical opening, made a few inspired and aggressive moves and won the game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_4800;The revelling and carousing is over... for now. Time to get back to real life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_4000;Of course I will come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4001;This should be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4002;Ah, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't know what [From.GetSheHe]'s missing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4003;What??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4015;People are so boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4030;Let's get it started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4031;Let's get... it started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4101;How peaceful this is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4111;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4112;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4113;I hope I'm not too drunk to remember this later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4114;Cheers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4120;You're my... best friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4131;Put'em up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4132;Well, if that's what you want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4133;Ooh, that hurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4141;Pass me the wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4142;I must invite [From.GetHerHim] more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4151;I can handle it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4152;[From.GetSheHeCap] should take it easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4161;We will play for money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4162;Very well, let's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4163;Hail to the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_4800;Well, it was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_4000;Unfortunately I can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4003;At least [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] has a sense of humor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4101;I think I will try some...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4112;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4132;Listen to me and calm down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4133;I honestly don't remember what I was so angry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4152;Cheers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4161;We will play for honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4163;I will get you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_4800;This is the real life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_WoL_4000;[FromFrom.GetHerHis] open decadence is shameful and I will tell [FromFrom.GetHerHim] so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_4111;No, we'd better not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_4132;I must escape and hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_4133;Maybe it's just as well. I'm not even angry anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_4800;Life is all about enjoying the company of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_WoL_4800;I'll dedicate all my free time to games now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
