EVTDESCLoR.800;One of the eunuchs at the Imperial Court has distinguished himself and caught the attention of your advisors. Though they are usually of the jealous kind and loathe to admit redeeming qualities in others, even they cannot deny the promise of this young man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.801;The eunuch is brought and you can immediately tell there is a keen intelligence behind the young man's eyes. His loyalty to you is without question, and here is a man who cannot be seduced by the wiles of women or turned against you by dynastic ties. Despite his few years, he has already won renown for his martial ability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite his few years, he has already won renown for his scholarship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.830;Your prisoner has been blinded and released. Another threat to your ambitions dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.831;Your jailors enter your cell grinning from ear to ear - something experience has taught you is a very bad sign. "Good news!" one of them says cheerfully. "New orders from the [From.GetTitle]. Ye are to be set free... after ye have been blinded. Take a good look at this cell, because it is the last thing ye shall ever lay eyes on!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.832;Your prisoner has been castrated and released. His screams could be heard all the way to your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.833;The commotion outside your cell wakes you suddenly and you demand to know what is going on. Your jailors enter accompanied by an old, toothless man who is carrying a satchel full of surgical instruments. "The [From.GetTitle], in [From.GetHerHis] infinite mercy, has ordered your release," one of the guards says. "After your castration is complete.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.834;You have the boy castrated and turned into a eunuch. You're a real piece of work, aren't you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.840;Supporters of the Blue and Green chariot teams have clashed at the Hippodrome and riots have broken out! The City Guard is fighting to contain the situation, but the Varangian Guard is also standing by. They would make mincemeat of any hooligans before the riot has a chance of spreading to other districts, but there could be significant collateral damage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.841;Hundreds of rioting chariot supporters are hacked down as the axe-wielding Norsemen charge into their ranks. Many attempt to flee, but the Varangians give chase and show no mercy to those they catch. The streets are littered with the mangled corpses of hooligans... and a few dozen innocent bystanders. The Varangians are a blunt hammer to be wielded with care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.842;The City Guard pulls in reinforcement from the other districts and finally manage to disperse the rioting crowds. Many neighborhoods are burning and looting is widespread in those districts the Guard was forced to abandon, but the loss of life is relatively small.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.846;[target_daughter.GetFirstName], your impudent daughter, seems to have fallen head over heels in love with one of your Varangian bodyguards, and the feeling is mutual. She has asked your permission to marry the man. He is apparently considered to be of some minor nobility in the frozen North, but can hardly be considered "good stock.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.851;[target_mayor.GetTitledFirstName] sends word that several members of the Varangian Guard ran amok in his quarter of Constantinople yesterday. In their drunken stupor, the Norsemen set fire to an inn, killed three guards and physically abused five local merchants and two priests. The people are crying out for justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.860;You are enjoying a late supper at the Great Palace in Constantinople, sampling some new wines brought in from the provinces, when the sound of a distant explosion is heard. Windows shatter and the chandelier above begins to sway as the shockwave hits a second later. Dust trickles down from the roof, and to your dismay some of it lands in your wine.\n\nYou hurry to a balcony overlooking the city and see an intense fire burning at one of the warehouses by the docks. The nearby water in the Golden Horn is also ablaze, and the fire has already spread to several ships in the busy inlet. While their crews are in the process of abandoning them, the harbor area is rocked by a flurry of smaller explosions from the burning warehouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.861;The next day, after the fire has finally burned out, you inspect the ruins of the warehouse with your bodyguard. You learn from your advisors that this building housed the primary stockpile of liquid fire, or "Greek fire" as it is commonly referred to as outside the Empire. This slow-burning liquid can set water itself aflame and has delivered Constantinople safely from more than one siege.\n\nThe damage done to the warehouse and harbor area is the least of your concerns, however. No trace remains of the liquid's formula, a closely guarded Byzantine state secret since the 7th century, or the alchemists who were working in the warehouse. Without them or the formula, your supply of liquid fire has been cut off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.862;Strange reports have surfaced of a pirate fleet in the Black Sea. If witnesses are to be believed, the pirates burn those who will not surrender with a "sea fire" spewed forth from the prows of their galleys. Could it be that these pirates have somehow obtained the formula for liquid fire?\n\nIf this critical weapon enters widespread use by the enemies of the Empire, we will lose a decisive edge! The Megas Doux has drawn up a plan to dispatch a small naval task force to the Black Sea, which will seek out and capture these brigands. Your Spymaster has suggested an alternate plan, however. Spies will be planted in every major port around the whole sea until they manage to infiltrate the pirate gang and uncover their secret hideout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.863;News has arrived from the Black Sea! The task force you sent there was successful in its attempt to force an engagement with the pirate fleet. In a hard-fought battle near the Crimea, your sailors managed to board and capture one of the pirate galleys. They lost several of their own ships to liquid fire in the attempt, but their prize is even now coming in to dock at the harbor in Constantinople.\n\nAmong the captured pirates is a young woman named Despina. This vixen was apparently the galley's captain, and she claims to be the daughter of the pirate king himself, a man named Kyrillos. If this is true, you may have gained a hostage worth her weight in gold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Your men tell you this old hag has quite the temperament, and that she claims to be the wife of the pirate king himself, a man named Kyrillos. If this is true, you may have gained a hostage worth her weight in gold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.865;News has arrived from the Black Sea! The task force you sent there has met defeat at the hands of the pirate fleet! In a hard-fought battle near the Crimea, the pirates ambushed your sailors and set their ships alight with liquid fire. A single ship escaped and has just now managed to limp back into port in Constantinople.\n\nIt is now clearer than ever that this potent weapon cannot be permitted to remain in the hands of savages and criminals. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.866;News has arrived from the Black Sea! One of your spies succeeded in infiltrating the pirate fleet, and has spent the past month as an oarsman on one of their galleys. Information about the origins of their miraculous "sea fire" was apparently restricted to their ranking officers, and he never did manage to learn the location of their hideout.\n\nThere is good news, however. He brought a prisoner with him when he escaped from their fleet: a young woman named Despina. This vixen was apparently the captain of the galley he served on, and she claims to be the daughter of the pirate king himself, a man named Kyrillos. If this is true, you may have gained a hostage worth her weight in gold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.868;News has arrived from the Black Sea! Your Spymaster presents a sack that was delivered earlier today by an anonymous courier. Its contents are poured out on the table in front of you: the severed heads of every single operative you sent to infiltrate the pirate fleet.\n\nClearly you are not dealing with a band of simple cutthroats. These pirates represent a serious security threat to the entire Empire. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.869;A letter was found this morning nailed to the doors of the Great Palace. It appears to have been written in blood, presumably from the dead palace guard left impaled on a spear in the garden. It reads:\n\n"You have something of mine, and I have something of yours. I propose a trade. On the back of this letter you will find a map to a small island in the Aegean. Bring my Despina, and I will bring the formula of your liquid fire as well as the only alchemist left alive with the knowledge to produce it.\n\nSigned,\nKing Kyrillos the Magnanimous";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.870;A letter was found this morning nailed to the doors of the Great Palace. It appears to have been written in blood, presumably from the dead palace guard left impaled on a spear in the garden. It reads:\n\n"Enough games, [Root.GetTitle]. I am in possession of something you want, and you must realize by now that it cannot be seized by force of arms. I propose a trade. On the back of this letter you will find a map to a small island in the Aegean. Bring plenty of gold, and I will bring the formula of your liquid fire as well as the last surviving alchemist with the knowledge to produce it.\n\nSigned,\nKing Kyrillos the Magnanimous";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.872;You set sail with a small fleet for the island Kyrillos indicated in his letter. As you draw near, you order the rest of your ships to disperse and cover any potential escape routes while you approach with your flagship. The pirate king has already arrived at the small, barren island and you make your landing with Despina and a small shore party of trusted Varangian Guardsmen. Kyrillos stands surrounded by his brigands.\n\n"Release the girl," he bellows. "Ye shall get yer alchemist and formula back, on my honor." The pirates push a frail old man holding a scroll forwards, and you do the same with Kyrillos' daughter. "My apologies about the warehouse and docks," the pirate king says with a smile. "We had to cover our tracks." With the deal concluded, both groups depart on their ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Kyrillos stands surrounded by his brigands.\n\n"I see ye brought my wife," Kyrillos says. "If ye think ye can barter with her, ye will be disappointed. But I will lower the ransom by one third if ye promise to keep her." Eleni objects loudly at this, but the pirates push a frail old man holding a scroll forwards, and you grudgingly provide the ransom. With the deal concluded, you take Eleni back to your ship and both groups depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.878;You set course for Constantinople and your men confirm that the old man is indeed one of the missing alchemists. The formula he brought also seems genuine. Before you reach the Dardanelles you meet up with the rest of your fleet. The ambush you planned was a success! They managed to intercept Kyrillos and his galley, and after a fierce struggle they captured both the pirate king and his daughter.\n\nWith the secrets of liquid fire safely returned to the Empire, and with the criminals who stole it tied up in the hold of your ship, it seems this matter can finally be put to rest. As you approach the Bosphorus and the shining city of Constantinople comes into view, you take a deep breath of fresh sea air. It is good to be [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Before you reach the Dardanelles you meet up with the rest of your fleet... or what remains of it. The ambush you planned was a failure, as they in turn were ambushed by Kyrillos' fleet! Only a few ships managed to escape and any hope of capturing the pirate king has now been lost.\n\nThe secrets of liquid fire have been returned to the Empire, but only at great cost. It is with a heavy heart you approach the Bosphorus. When Constantinople comes into view, the sky behind the great city is covered in dark stormclouds.

EVTDESCLoR.881;You set course for Constantinople and your men confirm that the old man is indeed one of the missing alchemists. The formula he brought also seems genuine.

EVTDESCLoR.885;A large merchant caravan from distant lands has arrived at the gates of your stronghold. Their leader, a jovial man of massive girth, pleads with you in a strange accent to grant them shelter from the elements for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.886;As evening falls, the fat merchant sits by the fire and regales you and the rest of the court with stories of his travels. His appetite seems insatiable, but as you do not wish to prove a poor host, you order your servants to bring in a second serving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.887;Dawn breaks, and the caravan prepares to move on. The merchant insists on leaving you a gift, as thanks for your great hospitality. He shouts a terse command in a foreign language and a young man comes forward. "This eunuch will serve you well," the merchant says. "His loyalty to you, his new master, shall be beyond reproach.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.901;[tzykanion.GetTitledFirstName] has challenged you to a friendly game of tzykanion at the tzykanisterion stadium in [Root.Location.GetName]. This popular Byzantine game can trace its origins back to Sassanid Persia, and features two teams on horseback using sticks with nets to get a leather ball into the opposing team's goal. Will you accept the challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.902;You spend a wonderful afternoon at the tzykanisterion, playing a tense game of tzykanion that ends in victory for your team. Your opponent and his team are magnanimous in defeat, and you depart the stadium as friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.903;You spend a wonderful afternoon at the tzykanisterion, playing a tense game of tzykanion that sadly ends in a defeat for your team. Your opponent and his team are magnanimous in victory, and you depart the stadium as friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.904;Sadly, the afternoon you spend at the tzykanisterion ends in disaster. The game of tzykanion quickly devolves into a violent melee after you break your stick against the head of your challenger in a sudden fit of rage. You howl obscenities and curses at your opponents, and it takes the efforts of your entire team to end the fight and pull you away from the stadium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.800;Very well. Bring this man before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.801;You will serve me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.830;Watch your step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.831;S-stay away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.832;He had it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.833;No! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.834;These are violent times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.840;Unleash the Varangian Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.841;Such is the fate of those who oppose me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.842;Centuries from now, hooliganism will be extinct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.846;Very well. Whatever makes her happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.851;Make an example of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.860;This must be investigated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.861;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.862;Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.863;Guards, treat her well. We may need her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.865;Yes... but what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.869;An excellent opportunity for an ambush...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.872;The deal is concluded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.878;Bring us in to dock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.885;Very well. Let them in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.886;Tell us more about this mythical realm of Hindustan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.887;That is very kind. I accept your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.901;Of course. I will get the old team together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.902;We must do this again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.903;We need to do a rematch sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.904;This isn't over! THIS ISN'T OVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBLoR.800;He should be cleaning floors and watching over women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.840;The City Guard can handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.846;Heavens no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.851;Oh, come now. Boys will be boys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.860;Pretty, but I need a new glass of wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.862;Send in the spies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.869;I cannot risk backstabbing this man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.885;No, these peddlers may sleep in a ditch for all I care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.887;No, you may keep your servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.901;Sadly, I have no time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCLoR.846;Have the Varangian executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPLoR.831;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! is blinded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.833;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! is castrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.841;The Varangians prepare for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.842;The City Guard rallies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.861;You open an investigation into this strange explosion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.862;You return to the palace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.869;You await further developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.872;You prepare an ambush for the pirate king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.873;You decide to follow the pirate's instructions to the letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.878;Your ship hoists its sails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.886;The merchant caravan spends the night within your walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
