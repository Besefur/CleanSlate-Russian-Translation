EVTDESC89000;You have come to share more things than your husband with one of his other wives. The mutual feelings of love and affection that exist between the two of you is something you have simply never felt with [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89001;The most disturbing rumor has come to your attention. It seems two of your wives have sinfully engaged in carnal pleasures with each other! The rest of the household must be laughing at you behind your back... something must be done about this shameful crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89002;Your two sinful wives, possessed by a depraved and unnatural love for each other, have eloped! Try as they might, your guards can't find them anywhere in your palace and a carriage in the courtyard outside has been reported stolen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89003;Leading your scouts forward, you intercept your fleeing wives in their carriage at the edge of a deep ravine. You dismount and approach the carriage, but as you draw near it suddenly takes off towards the ravine. Moments before their horses leap off the edge, you see your wives clasping each other's hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89005;I should be first amongst the wives of [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]. That I am not shames us both. For his sake, if not my own, I should act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89006;The first of your wives has passed away unexpectedly, with your healers claiming nothing could be done. They suspect poison may be the cause. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], who is now your new first wife, can barely conceal her elation. As the guards move her belongings into her new quarters, one of them confiscates a suspicious half-empty vial...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89007;It seems one of your husband's lesser wives has tried to poison you in a desperate bid to become his first wife! It was blind luck alone that made you discover this attempt on your life before it was too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89008;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], the first of your beloved wives, is very upset. She claims to have caught one of your lesser wives in the act of poisoning her food! Evidence uncovered by your household guards seem to verify this claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89009;I can't fight all your battles for you, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]! Just tell her not to do it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89010;One of your beloved wives covets the position of first wife, and has been trying to woo you into elevating her to that status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89011;That witch [Root.Spouse.Spouse.GetFirstName] has somehow ensnared [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] with her black magic. She has manipulated him into granting her your rightful position as the first among his wives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89012;Tragic news, Master! Your new first wife has passed away, and your healers all agree that poison was the cause. Your former first wife, overcome with jealousy, has made no attempt to hide her guilt in this crime. What should be done with her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89015;Though you are the first wife of [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], his current announced heir is not a child of yours. Perhaps you could talk to your husband and persuade him to grant your son more land, thus increasing his power and influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89016;Your dear mother, [Root.Mother.GetTitledFirstName], is very upset that despite her position as your father's first wife, his announced heir is not a child of hers. Today she has announced her intentions to plead with your father to grant you more land, thus increasing the influence of her favored little boy... you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89017;Your dear first wife, [From.Mother.GetFirstName], has once again cornered you and is expressing her shame and embarrassment over the fact that your current heir is not a child of hers. She is pleading with you to grant more land to her precious boy [From.GetFirstName], increasing his influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89018;Despite your mother's arguments, your father has refused to grant you more land for now. In fact, he seems a bit disappointed that you would let your mother fight your battles for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89020;You have toiled long and hard for your husband, [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], and even gifted him with a son. But the heir is not a child of yours, and as soon as [Root.Spouse.Heir.GetFirstName] assumes the throne, your son may be killed as a pretender. Perhaps it would be best to strike first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89021;Auntie [From.GetFirstName], one of your father's wives, gives you a cup of tea and insists you drink it. The tea smells funny, though, and you refuse to taste it. When [From.GetFirstName] tries to force you to drink, the tea spills on the floor and is lapped up by one of your pet cats... who promptly dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89022;One of your wives, [From.GetFirstName], has been caught trying to serve a cup of poisoned tea to [Root.Heir.GetFirstName], your [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter] and heir. Only your [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter]'s keen senses revealed the beverage for the vile poison it was before [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] drank from the cup. It seems her goal was to make her own son your heir...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89023;Auntie [From.GetFirstName], one of your father's wives, gives you a cup of tea and insists you drink it. The tea tastes funny, though, and when you have emptied the cup, the world fades away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89024;Your [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter] and heir, [Root.Heir.GetFirstName], has mysteriously perished after becoming suddenly ill. Though you and your advisors suspect foul play, you have no idea where to place the blame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89025;Your [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter] and heir, [Root.Heir.GetFirstName], has perished after being served a cup of poisoned tea by [From.GetFirstName], your treacherous wife! It seems she murdered [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in an effort to see her own son declared as heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89030;You have toiled long and hard for your husband, [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], and even given him a son. But he has other sons not of your blood who will one day have designs upon the throne, and your son may be killed as a pretender. Perhaps it would be best to strike first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89032;One of your wives, [From.GetFirstName], has been caught trying to serve a cup of poisoned tea to one of your sons born by a different wife. Only your son's keen senses revealed the beverage for the vile poison it was before he drank from the cup. It seems her goal is to improve the influence and standing of her own offspring with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89034;One of your sons has mysteriously perished after becoming suddenly ill. Though you and your advisors suspect foul play, you have no idea where to place the blame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89035;One of your sons has perished after being served a cup of poisoned tea by [From.GetFirstName], your treacherous wife! It seems she murdered him in an effort to improve the influence and standing of her own offspring with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA89006;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], my dear wife. Let us bury the past and look to the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89007;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] must be told of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89008;It pains me, but the punishment for this must be death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89009;But... but she tried to KILL me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89010;Yes, she would make a good first wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89011;Quick! Where is the poison?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89012;Release her. She must truly love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89015;Yes, my son deserves more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89016;Mother, you're embarrassing me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89017;Fine, fine. If it will get you off my back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89018;But... but... I didn't tell her to...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89020;I do this for my son!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89021;P-poison?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89022;You would kill my own son? This will cost you dearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89023;I don't feel so good....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89024;My [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA89025;My [Root.Heir.GetSonDaughter]... you will suffer a thousand deaths for this, woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB89001;This disgraceful behavior ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89005;Woo [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89006;Is... is that poison? Guards, move her to the dungeons instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89008;Let her contemplate the error of her ways in the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89010;No. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is first amongst my wives, now and always.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89011;If that is his wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89012;Send the witch to rot in prison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89015;No, my husband knows best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89017;No, I do not care who his mother is. He has not earned it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89020;No, I cannot do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89022;Throw her into the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB89025;Throw the wench into the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC89001;They will pay with their lives...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC89005;No, I must accept my station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC89006;Force her to drink the vial's remaining content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC89008;I can't be fighting all your battles for you, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC89012;As my dear first wife has died, so shall she!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC89022;Oh well. Just don't do it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
