EVTDESC75000;[Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] is doing a superb job! I am having trouble with a town and a castle in [Root.Location.GetName] and I shall of course send my [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] to try and increase the relation between them and us, but which one should I start with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75000;The town!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75000;The castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75001;I have noticed Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName]'s hard-work and everyone seems to like [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHim]. I am deciding between having my Marshal heighten the morale of the troops or try to recruit more soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75001;Send Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] to heighten the troops' morale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75001;Send Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] to recruit soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75002;My coffers are almost empty and the peasants are restless. I only have one Steward, [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] and even if [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] is doing a wonderful job [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] cannot do more than one thing at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75002;Send Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] to increase the tax income;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75002;Send Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] to calm the peasants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75003;There is a man I need to arrest and another I want to assassinate. My Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] could either help with the arrest or the assassination, but not both. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75003;Send Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] to the arrest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75003;Send Spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] to the plot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75004;There is no [Root.job_spiritual.GetManWoman] better at increasing the Church's opinion of me or teach me to become a more pious [Root.GetManWoman] than my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75004;I need you to talk to the Church, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75004;Teach me to be a pious [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75005;There is no [Root.job_spiritual.GetManWoman] better at increasing the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church's opinion of me or teach me to become a more pious Muslim than my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75005;Talk to the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75005;Teach me to be a pious Muslim, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75010;My liege's [Root.GetChancellorName] [Root.Liege.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] has been looking at my wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] with lust in his eyes. I need to tell my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and ask [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] to do something about this before anything happens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75010;Complain to liege about the [Root.GetChancellorName]'s inappropriate behavior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75010;Maybe it's nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] accused [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] of looking at [From.GetHerHis] wife in an inappropriate way, 'with lust in his eyes' as [From.GetSheHe] said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75011;I will imprison [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75011;I don't believe [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] has done that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] took my concern seriously and imprisoned [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75012;[From.GetSheHeCap] did not like that I complained, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75013;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] claimed I had looked at [FromFrom.GetHerHis] wife with lust in my eyes, a most inappropriate behavior! My liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] chose to believe [FromFrom.GetHerHim], despite my attempts at convincing [From.GetHerHim] I had no desire for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75013;You really believe [FromFrom.GetHerHim] more than me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75014;The accusations [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] made, of me having looked inappropriately at [FromFrom.GetHerHis] wife, was dismissed by our liege [From.GetTitledFirstName]! [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s wife has a fine figure but I wouldn't dream of even dreaming of looking at her in an inappropriate way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75014;Thank you for believing in me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed my concerns, [From.GetSheHe] claimed [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] would never look at anyone in an inappropriate manner and would not listen to me as I tried to convince [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetChancellorName]'s guilt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75015;But, but... I saw [From.job_chancellor.GetHerHim] do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75020;One of my tasks as [Root.GetChancellorName] is to smooth relations between lords. Mostly I try to make other rulers or my liege's vassals like [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] better, but sometimes, as today, I find someone who doesn't like [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and then I work my magic on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75020;...one of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75020;...[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] [Root.Liege.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC75020;...the courtiers at [Root.Liege.Location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75021;I have had trouble with a vassal of mine and tried everything I could think of to help us get along better. [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to do in one day what I had struggled with for several weeks when [From.GetSheHe] told me to just ask the vassal for forgiveness, that was all that was needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75021;[Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] must be rewarded for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75021;It's just [From.GetHerHis] job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75022;All it took was a small: 'I'm sorry' from [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], and I do believe it was [From.Liege.GetHerHis] [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] that convinced [From.Liege.GetHerHim] to ask for my forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75022;I'm glad [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] said that [From.Liege.GetSheHe] was sorry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75023;[From.GetSheHeCap] only did [From.GetHerHis] job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75023;My [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and I had almost stopped talking to each other when [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] intervened. [From.GetSheHeCap] made [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] start talking to me, even like me a little bit more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75023;Such good work should be rewarded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75024;I had given up talking to [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] when [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] intervened and made me realize how silly we had behaved. Now we talk, and we both appreciate one another in a whole new way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75024;If it weren't for [From.GetFirstName] this would have gotten worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75025;I might have been too harsh to the courtiers at [Root.Location.GetName] but [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to calm them down and even like me more, just by giving them a half-day off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75025;How can I ever reward you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75025;Thank you, but you only did your job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75026;I hadn't really expected to be rewarded for what I had done, but it was nice of [From.GetTitledFirstName] to show that [From.GetSheHe] appreciated my hard work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75026;I will work even harder now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75027;It was true I only did my job, but it would be nice to for once get a 'Thank you,' or at least some sort of appreciation from [From.GetTitledFirstName] for my hard work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75027;You are welcome!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75030;My slothfulness gets me into trouble with my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] who claims I do not do a good enough job as a [Root.Liege.GetChancellorName] as I 'go to extreme lengths to avoid having to do any actual work'. [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s words, not mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75030;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75031;I grow more and more impatient with [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] slothfulness makes [From.GetHerHim] go to extreme lengths to avoid having to do any actual work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75031;Give a stern talking to [Root.GetChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75031;I will give [From.GetHerHim] one last chance to sharpen up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC75031;This is worth throwing someone in jail over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75032;I don't know how [From.GetTitledFirstName] found out about how my slothfulness caused us to miss the opportunity to improve [Root.Location.GetName], but [From.GetSheHe] did. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was disappointed and talked sternly to me for several minutes, chiding me for being slothful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75032;[From.GetSheHeCap] can't talk to me that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75032;I will learn from this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75033;[From.GetTitledFirstName] let me know [From.GetSheHe] knows about how my slothfulness caused us to miss that opportunity to improve [Root.Location.GetName] but that it did not matter. 'What's done is done,' [From.GetSheHe] told me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75033;That's a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75033;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is reprimanded by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75034;Before I knew it, someone grabbed me and dragged me to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s prison and threw me into a cell. I sat in that cell for what felt like days but it couldn't have been more than a couple of hours. [From.GetTitledFirstName] finally showed up, told me the reason I was in jail was because of my slothfulness and the missed opportunity to improve [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75034;This isn't happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75035;When I had finished talking sternly to [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] I didn't really expect [From.GetHerHim] to talk back, but the anger that filled [From.GetHerHim] fast was vented immediately. I ignored it and left [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName], barely able to speak because of [From.GetHerHis] anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75035;You had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75035;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is angry at [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75036;I was glad to hear [Root.GetMyChancellorName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to amend [From.GetHerHis] ways and start working harder. The slothfulness that caused us to miss the opportunity to improve [Root.Location.GetName] seems to have disappeared over night, and I am glad I talked sternly to [From.GetHerHim] about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75036;Good for you, and me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75040;There's an infidel in my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75040;Demand that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have the infidel burned at the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75040;Demand that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have the infidel exiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75041;There's an infidel at your court, my liege!', my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] said.\n'I demand you burn the infidel at the stake!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75041;The infidel will be burned at the stake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75041;I will do no such thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75042;There's an infidel at your court, my liege!', my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] said.\n'I demand you banish the infidel!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75042;The infidel will be banished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75042;I won't banish the infidel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75043;I watched gleefully as the infidel burned at the stake. The infidel will burn in the [Root.Religion.GetName] Hell as it burns now until the sins has burned from its soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75043;No more false religions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75044;Despite my demands, warnings and even pleas, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to burn the infidel at the stake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75044;But... it's an infidel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75045;The infidel was banished from the lands of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and forced to never return on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75045;It was a happy day for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75046;[From.GetTitledFirstName] chose to ignore my demands, the infidel I had found was not even banished, the infidel was let go without any punishment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75046;You can't just ignore the infidel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75050;There's a heretic in my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75050;Demand that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have the heretic burned at the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75050;Demand that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have the heretic exiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75051;My liege, you have a heretic in your court!', my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me in confidence.\n'I recommend you set an example and burn the heretic on the stake!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75051;The heretic will burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75051;No one will be burned at the stake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75052;[Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] found a heretic at my court and insisted, nay, demanded that I would banish the heretic and make sure the heretic would never return on pain of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75052;Banish the heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75052;Don't make me banish you instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75053;The heretic must have regretted his sins as he burned at the stake. This will be an excellent warning who challenges the one true faith, the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75053;Burn, heretic, burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75054;What good is my position as [From.GetLordSpiritualName] if my liege won't listen to me? The heretic did not burn on the stake despite my desperate demands to [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75054;But heresy is bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75055;[From.GetTitledFirstName] banished the heretic on pain of death if he would ever return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75055;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75056;[From.GetTitledFirstName] ignored my demands about banishing the heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75056;Why do [From.GetTitledFirstName] ignore the heretic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75060;The peasants in a county are complaining about Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s arbitrariness, they feel that [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] doesn't really understand the concept of rules and laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75060;They shouldn't be bothering me about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75061;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sent the peasants complaining about my arbitrariness to me and they were brave enough to air their concerns about me not being able to understand the concept of rules and laws!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75061;Of course I understand laws, I just don't follow them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75065;[Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s justice has brought peace to a troubled county. Fewer crimes are committed and fewer complaints are heard in the province. The peasants have never been happier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75065;I'm very glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75066;I can not take credit for the crime reduction, nor the fact the peasants seem happier but I believe that justice must be applied to make a better world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75066;Justice, that is, for everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75070;A county in my demesne is riddled with disease! I need to send Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] there, [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] will surely know what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75070;Please save the peasants! Who else am I going to get taxes from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75071;I try to work as hard as I can, saving the peasants one at a time. The disease is slowly giving up its hold on the county but it will take time before everyone is healthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75071;I saved another one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75075;Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] wants to hire ruffians to bully the peasants who are not paying their taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75075;Any way is good as long as money is entering the treasury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75075;Prevent him doing any harm, even if I will get less tax;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75076;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not like my suggestion to hire ruffians, when I tried explaining it would be easier to squeeze the peasants who are not paying their taxes [From.GetSheHe] still didn't want me to hire ruffians. I tried hiring them in secrecy but [From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow found out and stopped us before we had even started 'persuading' the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75076;Come on! I need those ruffians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75080;[Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] had come up with an idea for removing a thieves guild in counties: pay them to move elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75080;Pay to stop criminals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75080;We do not associate with criminals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75085;[Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] has had some interesting ideas on how to improve the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75085;Adopt [Root.job_treasurer.GetHerHis] ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75085;It's not worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75090;Working with thieves can be beneficiary, if my liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] does not get wind of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75090;Take a large cut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75090;Try to hide your involvement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75091;I followed [Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a distance and saw [From.GetHerHim] meet two rather rough looking men and went with them into a tavern infamous for it shoddy clientele. I watched through the dirty window how money exchanged hands and had the evidence I needed: [From.GetTitledFirstName] was working with thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75091;Throw [From.GetHerHim] into jail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75091;Take [From.GetHerHis] gold and let him go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75092;[From.GetTitledFirstName] waited for me at the gate together with two prison guards when I came back after my little meeting with the local thieves. I was thrown in prison and [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me I shouldn't have trusted the thieves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75092;Wait! Don't leave me here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75093;[From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me outside the tavern, me still counting the gold the thieves had given me in exchange for my cooperation. Instead of demanding my head or imprisoning me, [From.GetTitledFirstName] took the gold and told me to never associate with thieves ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75093;I promise, never again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75095;[Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] probably did not think I'd notice if a few coins here and there went missing, but the steady disappearance made me suspicious. Might it be that the gold is disappearing into [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s greedy fingers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75095;Question [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75095;I don't care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75096;[From.GetTitledFirstName] accused me of stealing! Coins had gone missing and all current evidence points at me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75096;I would never steal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75096;I admit it, I stole the money. But you pay me too little!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75097;[From.GetTitledFirstName] declared that [From.GetSheHe] was innocent. Further investigation revealed that the cook, responsible for the purchase of food stuff, had forgotten to account for the extra eggs he had bought during the last month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75097;Now I know I can trust [Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75098;I found some more evidence [Root.GetMyTreasurerName] [From.GetTitledFirstName] had stolen the money and confronted [From.GetHerHim] with it. [From.GetSheHeCap] confessed and begged me to be just when punishing [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75098;You shall pay back the money you stole, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75098;You shall rot in prison, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC75098;You are forgiven, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75099;[From.GetTitledFirstName] fined me for stealing money and took all the money I had!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75099;That was harsh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75100;[From.GetTitledFirstName] believed I had stolen the money and put me in prison to repent my crimes and my sins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75100;I repent, just let me out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75105;A band of highway robbers has been roaming freely in one of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s counties. I am itching to do something about this situation, I should propose to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] that we should deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75105;Me and a bunch of soldiers could easily take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75105;...or maybe I shouldn't put myself in danger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75106;The band of highway robbers has become more and more audacious, plundering more towns and settlements for everyday. Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] has proposed to lead an attack personally to eradicate them from the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75106;Give [From.GetHerHim] more than enough soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75106;Tell [From.GetHerHim] to bring [From.GetHerHis] own retinue only;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75110;One of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s prominent subjects has accused me of beating his daughter while a guest of their house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75110;The girl is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75111;A prominent subject has petitioned me for justice: His daughter had supposedly been beaten by Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] while [From.GetSheHe] was their guest and the father is requesting compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75111;Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be fined for [From.GetHerHis] crime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75111;Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC75111;I don't believe this. The daughter must be lying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75112;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to believe the girl's lies about me beating her and made me pay a huge fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75112;But I am innocent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75113;Despite the girl's father demanding my head on a plate, [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to be merciful and 'only' let me rot in the dungeon for who knows how long. The only trouble is, I am innocent of beating her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75113;Let me out! I didn't hurt her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75114;[From.GetTitledFirstName] believed me when I told [From.GetHerHim] I had never even talked to the girl who accused me of beating her and managed to find evidence that the girl was lying. Apparently, she and her friend had hatched a scheme to blackmail me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75114;Her black eye wasn't my fault then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC75120;Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] told me about [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] ideas. I couldn't really understand what [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] was talking about, but [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] was adamant in [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] belief that this would improve the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA75120;Adopt the Marshal's ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB75120;It's not worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP75011;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] tells [This.GetTitledFirstName] about [This.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName]'s inappropriate behavior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75012;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is glad [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] is imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75013;[Root.GetMyChancellorName] [This.GetTitledFirstName] is imprisoned by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75014;[Root.GetMyChancellorName] [This.GetTitledFirstName] is glad [Root.GetTitledFirstName] believes [This.GetSheHe] is innocent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75015;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is upset [Root.GetTitledFirstName] dismissed [This.GetHerHis] concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75021;[This.GetTitledFirstName] and [This.GetHerHis] vassal gets along better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP75022;[This.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] get along better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP75024;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is starting to like [This.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
