EVTDESC_JD_4100;The Radhanite merchants have cordially asked you to pay back the money you owe to them. They inform you that there is no hurry, but you can clearly tell that they are disappointed by the fact that you have yet to pay them back. It also seems that, for whatever reason, the amount of Radhanite trade going through your realm has reduced significantly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_4100;I should have payed them back earlier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
