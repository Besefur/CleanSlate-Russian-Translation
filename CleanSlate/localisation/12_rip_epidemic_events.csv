EVTDESC_RIP_13001;Word is going around that since the epidemic came to [capital.GetName] we have seen an increase in cats. Our people are sure the cats are helping the spread of disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13002;[cat_examiner.GetFirstName] reports that apart from showing disapproval of their capture, most of the cats seemed calm and healthy. Only a few show symptoms of illness, it is unlikely that cats are the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13003;Complaints about the cats will not end, an angry mob has gathered claiming that cats are the bringers of bad luck and cannot be allowed to roam the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13004;[worried_courtier.GetFirstName] has gotten the news of my decision to remove all the cats. 'Surely cats that are perfectly healthy should not be harmed, I could not accept that!' [worried_courtier.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13005;[worried_courtier.GetFirstName] should have taken care of hiding [worried_courtier.GetHerHis] feline friends. They have been spotted by others and now the people are furious this was kept secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13006;One of the examined cats seems to have taken a liking to you, a sweet meow whenever you pass by their cages and a soft purr whenever you come close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13007;[From.GetTitledName] has called for all cats to be terminated, as you enjoy your time with the cats around the court, this would be horribly upsetting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13008;[From.GetTitledName] refused to make an exception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13009;[From.GetTitledName] agreed to let me keep the cats, in exchange for a favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13010;After months of chatter about cats it appears as if the common people are now focusing on other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13011;Dissatisfied with my actions in the matter, the peasants have come with demands of not only the removal of all cats, but also additional tax refunds as compensation for me neglecting them earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13500;My court [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] informs that there is unrest within my borders. The recent outbreak of disease has made people worry that it is the wrath of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Some are even saying that it's my fault, for not going to temple more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_A;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the mantras of Shiva's enlightenment. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, the fair Shiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_B;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the holy words of Vishnu. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, Vishnu, the Protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_C;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I focus my emotions on Brahma, the creator. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, the mighty Brahma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_D;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the chant of Kali. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, Kali, the Goddess of Time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_E;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the mantras of Ganesha. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, the wise Ganesha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_F;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the mantras. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with my patron god, the holy Ganga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13501_G;I place the holy basil on the steps of the temple. I light the diya and I recite the mantra of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. My subjects have noticed the regularity with which I see to the rituals, but most importantly I feel reconnected with the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13502;My agent's regular visits to the temple has placated the commoners. I sometimes wonder what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] thinks of me for deceiving my people this way, but my council agrees - it would do no one good if the [Root.GetTitle] fell ill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13503;In the face of the misery tormenting our lands, the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] have found a new faith in me, their pious [Root.GetTitle]. One family has even sent their only child to be my servant, would I wish it - in their eyes they would be serving [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13504;The commoners have discovered my ruse! They have murdered my double and set fire to the temple! They now think that I, as well as the gods, have abandoned them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13505;The doubles I hired don't really look like me, but most of the peasants have never even seen my face - it's no wonder they believed that ugly impostor to be their real [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13506;The speech I gave about the gods demanding everyone's labor put a decent amount of fear into the commoners - they are working around the clock, the recent epidemic fueling a race against time. However, some rebels have been sabotaging the construction, and the suspects have been brought before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13507_A;The temple is finished and the people wipe the sweat from their brow. [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] will not be able to take this token of worship from me. The gods are certainly pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13507_B;Construction was already going on at the location I had planned to set up my temple! The builders saw easy money in my orders and "forgot" to inform me. Thankfully, my [Root.GetTreasurerName] has sorted it out. At least I get a small refund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13508_A;[vagrant_child_1.GetBestName] has been caught sneaking into the stable. [vagrant_child_1.GetHerHisCap] sibling claims they are friends with one of the elephants there, but some ruckus upset the animal and [vagrant_child_1.GetBestName] has been injured. The workers have put down their tools, declaring the project cursed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13508_B;Chaos has erupted in the stable nearby the construction site and elephants are going rampage! Some workers have been killed, and the survivors refuse to go back. They are saying that the project is cursed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
