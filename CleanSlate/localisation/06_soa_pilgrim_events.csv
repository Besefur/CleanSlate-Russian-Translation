EVTDESC_SoA_5000;I shall go on a pilgrimage to seek God's grace at one of the holy places of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5011;There are several different holy places that you could visit on your pilgrimage. All of them are considered most sacred by the holy church, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5016;I am blessed to be living in [Root.Capital.GetName], but I shall make my pilgrimage to the most holy of our Lord's places – Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5017;I am blessed to live near the holy places of our Lord in Palestine, but I shall follow in the footsteps of the apostles and make a pilgrimage to Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5018;There are a number of different holy places that you could visit on your pilgrimage. All of them are considered most sacred by the holy church, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5019;A pilgrimage in the west is just as worthy as a journey to Jerusalem or Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5020;Jerusalem and Rome are the two oldest and holiest places of the [catholic.GetName] church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5021;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon, I shall see fair Canterbury and the tomb of Thomas Becket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5022;My things are packed, everything is in order. At the end of my journey the Holy Land awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5023;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon I will see Köln and the Shrine of the Three Kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5024;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon I will walk the streets of the Eternal City and see all its marvels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5025;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to walk the Way of Saint James.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5026;The rain has been pouring down for days, it's almost impossible to travel the roads. Why does the Lord punish his faithful pilgrims so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5027;You look out across the beautiful valley stretching out before you. It would be a wonderful moment, if not for the fact that there should be no valley here. You are a pilgrim in an unfamiliar land and you have no idea where you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5028;Sleeping at the pilgrim's inn, you dream a beautiful dream. You are walking through a dense wood, filled with the wonderful sounds and smells of nature. Little squirrels run across your path and birds sing in the trees. You keep walking through the wood, and then you notice a new and strange but familiar smell. You can't quite put your finger on what it is, though. Hmm, it's something you should know, something important... Hmm... yes, it's... it's... it's fire! You are instantly wide awake. The room is hot, you can hear the sound of crackling flames and a moment later you also hear people screaming. Indeed, the inn is on fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5029;They said this was a lawless stretch of road, but you still feel rather unlucky to be in this situation. The robbers are many and armed, and they demand that you pay a 'toll' before you are allowed to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5030;The old wooden bridge has carried many pilgrims in its day. It creaks suspiciously as you step on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5031;You lay awake at night reflecting on your pilgrimage. It's an inner journey as well as a physical one, but can you be sure of which destination it will take you to? And do you even want to have that certainty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5032;Travelling down a long and lonesome road, you come upon a man lying in a ditch. He seems to have been robbed and beaten up quite badly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5033;There have been strong rains in the area lately, and the valley that you need to cross has been transformed into a sizeable lake. The water is still rising, so you start to build a large raft in order to cross. When you're almost finished building it, a group of farmers show up and explain that they also need to cross the valley in order to get back to their homes. They bring with them a number of animals that they've rescued from the flood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5034;At your camp at night, a large group of fellow pilgrims appear. They have travelled far and are hungry and out of food. You look through your supplies, but you have only just over half a dozen loaves of bread and a few fishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5035;You have spent the last fews days of your journey on water. The vessel you are travelling on rocks gently in the breeze, as the sailors go about their business. Being on board ship is quite unlike being on land – so much is different, so many strange words for all the things here. Starboard? Abaft? Aground? What does it all mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5036;As you stop to make camp near a river crossing along with other pilgrims, you observe a group of builders working on a new bridge just upstream. You walk up to them and see that the arches of the bridge are already half completed. The master builder notices your interest and walks up to you and offers to tell you about the construction techniques they are using.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5037;The journey is long and hard. Your feet are sore, and your back as well. Far from the castle kitchens the food is barely edible, and on top of that you seem to feel cold all the time. Perhaps you were not quite cut out for this pilgrimage thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5038;As you pass through a small village along the pilgrim's path, an old woman comes up to you. She has recognized you as a pilgrim and explains that her daughter and her family live close to your destination. They are suffering hard times and she asks you to bring them a large purse of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5039;There is a star shining unusually bright in the clear sky. You see it every night, and its position coincides more or less with the direction to the destination of your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5045;Thundering hooves are heard down the road. The pilgrims look with apprehension at the rising dust cloud. As the riders close, steel armour and steel-tipped lances reflect the bright sunlight. The tension rises, but then a collective sigh of relief is heard as the banner of the holy knights is seen flying above the mass of armored men. The knights halt before the pilgrims and graciously offer to accompany you on the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5046;As the evening approaches after a long day on the road, you come upon several campfires. Around the fires you find a group of holy knights, resting after a long day's ride. They invite you to share their meal and trade stories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5047;During the last couple of days, you have made company on the road with a holy knight on his way to the same destination. You have lively and interesting conversations, and you find that you have many things in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5050;You have finally arrived at Canterbury! It is beautifully situated on the river Stour in Kent in southeast England. The town itself and the surrounding meadows are full of pilgrims from all over Europe. You start to make your way through the hustle and bustle, eager to see the famous cathedral and contemplate the tomb of the martyr Thomas Becket, who was viciously murdered inside the cathedral itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5051;You have finally arrived at Jerusalem! Passing by the Mount of Olives, you enter through the city gate and are immediately overcome by a feeling of having made a truly epic journey. The city is filled with people of all creeds and colors, the air heavy with smells of strange spices and foreign plants. You make your way through the throng of people and animals, excited by the knowledge that you are now close to the Via Dolorosa and the other holy places. You plan to also visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, but first of all you need to find someplace to stay. After all, you wouldn't want to be forced to sleep in a stable, would you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5052;You have finally arrived at Köln! The mighty cathedral housing the relics of the Three Kings is still under construction, but it is an impressive structure nonetheless. The city itself lies on the mighty river Rhine, and busy commerce mingles with the flow of pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5053;You have finally arrived at Rome! As you enter the Eternal City, you are struck by the many ancient buildings and monuments that you pass by. It is truly impressive, and you try to imagine how the apostles felt when they first came here on their holy mission at a time when the city's power was at its peak. Though large areas seem to be depopulated, the city still boasts an impressive population concentrated around the Tiber river. The holy sites you want to visit are primarily the basilicas of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, as well as other early churches and places connected to the martyrs. You start making your way to the center of the city, hoping that you won't get lost in traffic as the crowds start to get more dense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5054;You have finally arrived at Santiago, the oldest major pilgrimage site in the West. It is an inland town close to the Atlantic Ocean, with origins going back at least to the Roman Empire. The fabled Way of Saint James is a long road to travel, and you have passed through many towns and villages on your way here.\n\nThe legend holds that as Saint James' remains were brought here by ship from Jerusalem, they were lost at sea due to a storm. But soon after they were miraculously washed ashore, covered in scallops. Because of this, scallop shells have become a popular souvenir among pilgrims.\n\nYour mind dwells on the legends of this holy place, as you make your way through the crowds towards the center of town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5056;As you walk around on this holy ground, you ponder the secrets and the essence of God. The teachings of the holy church have never felt more relevant to you than now. Imagine the knowledge contained in the scriptures stored here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5057;The saints, this holy ground, how it all moves my soul! I realize now that all my life up to this point has only been a preparation for this journey. How wondrous that the light of the Lord truly shines in me, a poor sinner. From now on I shall always do His work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5058;Traveling all this way to see the holy places, you had hoped for more than this. It's just lots of people, some churches and a few bones that really look quite suspicious. Before coming, you had read the exalted stories of other pilgrims, but this just isn't like they described it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5059;As you approach the holy temple, you overhear a theological discussion between several priests. You stop and eagerly engage them in conversation, expanding upon several of your favorite topics. They are very impressed by your knowledge and invite you to hold a lecture for a group of assembled religious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5060;The bustling mass of pilgrims is impressive, as are the many languages, colors and ways of dress present. People come here from west, east, north and south. You are standing at a place where the roads meet, and that is where people and ideas meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5061;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you came here, to one of Christianity's holiest places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5062;So far from home, all alone, and so many lovely people in the same situation as me. It's a great opportunity for some fun, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5063;This holy place is bustling with pilgrims from all over the world, and a myriad of accents and languages mingle in the parks and plazas. In this great cultural melting pot, should there not also be room for me to express who I really am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5064;Near the holy sites, you hear rumors of a group of monks with strange cures for diseases. Eagerly, you seek them out, hoping against hope that they may aid you. Once in their care you are fed strange potions, foods and herbs. You are unconscious or delirious during most of the process and remember few details, but at last you wake up to find that you have been miraculously healed of your ills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5065;All these magnificent temples built in your honor! Oh the glory! And all these pilgrims - finally you may revel in their adulation. Perhaps you should reveal yourself to the masses who have come to worship you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5066;You have come to visit the holy sites and show your devotion. But surely, there is no harm in having a little fun first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5067;Jerusalem, what a fascinating place! A holy place for three great religions, and the city and surrounding area are full of monuments giving tribute to God. Somehow when you look closer, they don't seem all that different. It rather makes you think, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5080;Blasphemous fools! Do they not know their Lord? How dare they throw you out of your own temple?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5087;You have made friends with [target_friend.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5091;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. It was a rewarding and interesting journey, and you'd do it all again if you could. Still, it's good to be back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5092;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. It didn't turn out quite as expected, and perhaps you shouldn't have gone there in the first place. But there's no changing it now, at least you're home again and can start forgetting about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5093;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. Though the insolent rats did not recognize you or pay you proper homage, it was still an enlightening experience. Now there is plenty of time to prepare the day of reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5094;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon I will stand at the Bosphorus and see the marvels of Constantinople.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5095;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon I will see old Aksum, the holiest place in Christian Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5096;My things are packed, everything is in order. Ancient Antioch awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5097;You have finally arrived at Constantinople! The city is enormous, dwarfing all other cities that you've seen. There is a bustle of people, commerce, sounds and smells that overpower your senses and leave you quite dizzy. As you make your way through the streets in order to find a place to stay, you are impressed by scale and number of the ancient churches and monuments that appear everywhere along your path.\n\nYou press on through the crowds, eager to finally look upon such fabled churches as the Hagia Sofia and the Saint George.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5098;You have finally arrived at Aksum! This is one of the oldest centers of the Christian faith, and it is here that the Ark of the Covenant is kept, guarded by monks inside the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Though no longer the great city it once was, Aksum is still an important center of pilgrimage, and you can see many travellers in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5099;You have finally arrived at Antioch! This is the oldest city of Christianity, the first place where people actually began to call themselves 'Christian'. Saint Peter and Saint Paul both worked here, as did Saint Ignatius. It is a place where early Christendom was formed and defined, and it later expanded from here, westwards, to Rome and beyond.\n\nAs your feet tread the ancient streets of Antioch, you can feel the history and tradition in the air around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5028;Deep in the night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SoA_5026;Blessed is [Root.GetSheHe] who perseveres under trial. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5027;If only I hadn't listened to those useless peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5028;Help put it out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5029;Pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5030;No time to stop, I'm sure it'll hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5031;The mind wanders where it will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5032;Bind up his wounds, help him to an inn and pay for his recovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5033;I'm not sharing my raft with anyone, man or beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5034;Share it around, it's more filling than it looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5035;This is fascinating. I must take the opportunity to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5036;Yes, tell me more about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5037;My faith will see me through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5039;The Lord is showing me the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5045;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! A most welcome escort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5046;Discuss theology with the knights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5047;How unexpected, to make a new friend this far from home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5050;A green and pleasant land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5051;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5052;I will pray at the Shrine of the Three Kings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5053;A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5054;I must remember to bring a seashell home with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5056;The way to Heaven is through study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5057;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5058;That's it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5059;I will be most pleased to share my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5060;Take the opportunity to observe different languages and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5061;It was well worth the journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5062;What's the harm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5063;The folks at home will never know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5064;God's hand touched me and healed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5065;Speak to them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5066;To the tavern!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5067;Muhammad was a great thinker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5080;I shall have my vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5087;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5091;A great experience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5092;I won't tell my family what really happened out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5093;They will pay for worshipping false idols.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5094;My journey begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5095;My journey begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5096;My journey begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5097;Ah, the City of Constantine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5098;It is beautiful, ancient Aksum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5099;A great and ancient city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SoA_5011;I will go to Constantinople and see its great cathedrals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5018;I will go to one of the ancient sites, Jerusalem or Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5019;I will visit Köln to see the relics of the Three Kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5020;I will go to Rome and see the tombs of the apostles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5026;This is absurd - I should have stayed home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5027;If only I'd listened more to those peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5028;Save yourself and let others handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5029;Give these scoundrels the only thing they deserve – steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5030;Stop and help repair it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5031;It's all right there on the map. Time to get some sleep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5032;Leave him, he's probably dead anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5033;Bring the farmers with all their animals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5034;Sorry, there's not enough for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5035;This does not concern me. I will spend my time in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5036;Nobles build castles. This is for peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5037;Maybe this was a bad idea. I'll stay and rest for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you (secretly add some money of your own).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5039;It's a bright star, so what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5045;Never trust armed men who appear out of nowhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5046;Trade stories of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5047;I have no need for friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5056;No, I shall spend my time praying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5060;Take the opportunity to meet new people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5062;That's not what I'm here for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5063;No, it's a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5064;These monks really know their stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5065;No, I shall enjoy this glorious time in silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5066;No... must control... myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5067;Jesus was a Jew, wasn't he?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SoA_5011;I will go to Antioch, like the apostles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOA_5018;I will seek out a saintly burial site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5019;I will visit the tomb of Saint James in Santiago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5030;These people deserve a stone bridge. I shall pay for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5033;Only let them bring the cats and dogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you (lie and keep the money for yourself).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SoA_5064;I must learn more of this secret magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SoA_5011;I will travel to Aksum, where the Ark of the Covenant lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SoA_5038;This is not my business, old crone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
