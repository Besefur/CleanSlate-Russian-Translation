EVTDESCCM15000;You've been thrown into a pit dug out in the middle of the desert. The guards explain to you that you are to be judged by Zun the Justice-Giver. If you are guilty, the Sun will punish you for your crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCM15002;The guards visited me today, they merely tossed down a rope I hope I have the strength to climb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCM15004;The rays from the sun dig into my skin, it cracks and bleeds and I feel myself slipping away almost as if floating out of this pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCM15005;Who's there, who are you? I can hear you but can't touch you? P-Please help me I can hear you just outside the pit please i'm begging you.!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCM15006;As I lie in the pit hoping for salvation yet another day I realize that none will come. Has I been forsaken? No that can't be it! I must keep believing, its the only thing I have left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCM15007;On my back, staring up at the sun beating down upon me. This pit is torture, the heat scratches my skin like a thousand tiny blades I hope for salvation, I hope for freedom, I hope that my captors will release me but deep down I'm starting to realise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTACM15002;Oh sweet freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACM15004;Is this how I die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACM15005;Was that a person leaning over the edge, or a figment of my imagination!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACM15006;I will prove myself worthy to be [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACM15007;The only one that can release me from this torture, from the unbearable heat is my new overlord Zun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
