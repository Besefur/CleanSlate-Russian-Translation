EVTDESC74000;I had invited a monkey trainer to the Summer fair and the performance went well until one of the monkeys refused to ride on top of a pig. The trainer beat the monkey with a stick which led the other monkeys to attack the trainer, biting him and hitting him with his own stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74005;The Summer Fair's Archery contest went very well. The clout and the space around it was filled with arrows, some of them had hit the bullseye, some of them had missed the clout altogether. The winner was a modest man who disappeared rather quickly after he collected his prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74010;The jester who performed during the Summer Fair ran around in his silly hat with bells, and before I knew it he hit me with his bauble! Everyone laughed at this and at his 'jokes', or rather his insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74015;Mummers are singing outside the town houses while slowly moving towards my castle. The Summer Fair suddenly felt less pleasant as the mummers,  clad in strange clothes, went from door to door, singing and frightening small children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74020;When the alderman asked for permission for a Summer Fair I could never have guessed I would regret that. After a Piepowder Court held in front of my own bailiff, they sentenced one of my vassals to being drawn in a tumbler across the town square!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74025;The strolling players had set up their scene and were rehearsing their lines for tonight's performance at the Summer Fair when I approached them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74030;Even if the church frowns upon jugglers and calls them 'gleemen', I enjoy their humorous and bawdy acts during the Summer Fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74035;It was a mistake inviting The Jumping Jews of Jerusalem to the Summer Fair. They are jumping at different rhythms despite the rhythmic twang of a harp. They tirelessly keep jumping, jumping, jumping... until one of them loses his balance and falls towards his brothers, causing all of them to fall to the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74040;Every Summer Fair, mages and diviners flock to read signs, events and omens. Their interpretation of such things are often exaggerated but there are still people who believe in their rituals and interpretations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74041;[From.GetTitledFirstName] does not care about the pagan mages and diviners that flock at Summer Fairs to lure honest people from their hard-earned pennies and make them believe their ridiculous interpretations of everyday life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74042;An errant monk is disturbing the Summer Fair by preaching about sins and the end of the world. His drivel is frightening some, but most of the crowd around him is mocking and laughing at him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESC74043;The errant monk preaching about the end of the world and sins is attracting quite a crowd. Most of them are laughing at and mocking him, but some look terrified and some are listening intently. [From.GetTitledFirstName] does not seem to appreciate the seriousness of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74044;Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] caught the peddlers selling stolen goods red-handed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74045;The local nobles of [Root.Location.GetName] complain about too many peasants entering the city during the Summer Fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74046;During the Summer Fair, the peasants are pouring in through the gates of [Root.Location.GetName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName] does not care at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74047;The peddlers are loading their wares and the merchants are taking down their stalls. The jugglers, strolling players and the other entertainers are preparing to leave. The Summer Fair is over for this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74050;I have given the order that a summer fair should be held in [Root.Capital.GetName] this summer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA74000;Shouldn't someone do something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74005;That is suspicious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74010;It was rather funny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74015;If they think they will get in, they are wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74020;I can't believe their imprudence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74025;I'd prefer if you performed 'The Crusader Kings';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74030;One of them can juggle nine apples at the same time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74035;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74040;Allow them to stay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74041;Why do you allow them to deceive people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74042;He's just another part of the entertainment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTA74043;Kick him out! He's clearly disturbing the peasants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74044;Execute them publicly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74045;Tell them to accept the peasants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74046;My beautiful city! How can you let this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74047;It was great fun while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74050;This should make the peasants happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB74000;Serves him right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74005;So he was a good archer, a good poacher as well I think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74010;Well, obviously he couldn't get a better job;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74015;Yes, this is exactly what I don't need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74020;This is what happens when the *beep* get power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74025;Theatre is a reflection of the world;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74030;The church does not like fun things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74035;Off with their heads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74040;Banish them from the Summer Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74042;Kick him out, he does not belong at the Summer Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74044;Seize his goods and lock him up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74045;Restrict the peasants access to the city;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC74000;Save that poor man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74005;Marshal, find and arrest that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74010;What a fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74015;My vassal told me to not let them in, so I won't;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74020;They will regret this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74025;Leave as soon as you are done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTC74030;If the priest says anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74035;The end was fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD74000;He shouldn't have beaten that poor creature;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74005;Good archer, that man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74010;If he jokes about me, then he has gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74015;Come on in! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74020;Once more! Please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74025;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] wants you to join us for supper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74030;If the church doesn't like it, should I really like it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE74000;Here's your money, I don't ever want to see you here again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE74005;I wanted to talk to him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE74010;Throw him into the prison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE74015;I can't wait! I love mummers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE74020;They did exactly what they should have done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG74010;If I pay him more, perhaps he will not joke about me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC4105;The Summer Fair brings all kinds of entertainers to [Root.Location.GetName] and a puppet show got my attention when I heard the giggles, laughter and wolf-whistles from its audience. After watching the show for a while, I realized that one of the characters was supposed to be me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4170;Its ragged fur and sorrowful eyes made the bear look pitiful, but when its trainer started playing his flute the bear started dancing. The dancing bear and his trainer travelled from fair to fair and this year they came to the Summer Fair in [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA4105;It's not very lifelike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4170;I wonder how he does that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB4105;Mockery, what else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4170;How clumsy he dances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC4105;That is so funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4170;Keep him on a short leash, if he does anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD4105;Let me try it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4170;Training a bear can't be too hard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE4170;He really loves to dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# No longer used
# EVTOPTF74005;I can't help but feel the prize was inadequate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTOPTF74010;Haha! He's such a fool;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP74041;[This.GetTitledFirstName] disapproves of the diviners and mages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP74043;The errant monk upsets [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTTOOLTIP74046;is annoyed with [Root.GetTitledFirstName] decision about letting the peasants in;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
