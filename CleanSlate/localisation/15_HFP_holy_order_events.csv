EVTDESC_HFP_44001;My dear [Root.GetTitledName]\nThe knights have been looking for somewhere easily defensible, where we can help guide all [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] souls to the Holy Land. We think your newfound lands in [potential_title.GetBaseName] might be the perfect location, and we would pay you for your troubles.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_44003;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write you this letter to inform you that I and my men have officially left your service. We no longer see you fit to rule, and we have once more returned to the faithful service of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_44004;The magnanimous [From.GetTitledName] has donated the island of [potential_title.GetBaseName] to the Knights of Saint John, better known as the Knights Hospitaller. As one of the long standing protectors of the faith, this will surely make the routes safer for all the pilgrims seeking the Holy Land. The order is now known as the Knights of [potential_title.GetBaseName], and [d_knights_hospitaller.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] vows to continue their mission as the righteous defenders of Christianity and its faithful followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_44006;[Root.GetTitledName]\nWe wish to finally root out our ancient enemies in the north, and your newfound lands of [holy_order_potential_title.GetBaseName] would help us greatly in this mission. We would re-compensate you for your troubles, as we would not dare insult one with your status.\n\nSigned,\n[d_teutonic_order.Holder.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_44007;Supported by the charitable [From.GetTitledName], the Teutonic Order has settled down in [holy_order_potential_title.GetBaseName]. Dedicated to removing the northern infidels once and for all, [d_teutonic_order.Holder.GetTitledName] has started a massive campaign in order to revitalize [holy_order_potential_title.GetName] and turn it into a staging ground for their future wars.\n\nWorking out of [FromFrom.Capital.GetName], it is only a matter of time before they will conquer the rest of [kingdom_title.GetBaseName]. The heathens look towards the new seat of the Teutonic Order with fear and skepticism, knowing they will have to fight to retain their ungodly ways and traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_44010;After finally losing their final bastion, the Teutonic Knights are once more landless and have started traveling back to the core lands of Christendom.\n\nAs they no longer have a realm of their own, they are once more known as the Teutonic Order, and will offer their services to whatever Christian Lord or Lady fighting the infidels.\n\nThe fall of the Teutonic State is surely a blow to the Catholics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_44001;Whatever the [d_knights_hospitaller.GetName] wants, I offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_44010;Blasted infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_44001;No, I need these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_44006;My apologies, but these lands are my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_44010;Those of the Order are not meant to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_44010;Only the first of many to fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
