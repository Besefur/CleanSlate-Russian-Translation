EVTDESCAHF20067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to come meet me a few days from the capital to formally and personally welcome me to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Riding alongside [From.GetHerHis] men-at-arms, there was also [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName], the [Root.Culture.GetName] priest I had sent to help [From.GetTitledFirstName] some time ago. Seeing a familiar face traveling with my host has certainly been an appreciated gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20068;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was clearly pleased to have me welcome [From.GetHerHim] personally before arriving at the capital. [From.GetSheHeCap] thanked me for my kindness and talked about what an interesting travel [From.GetSheHe] has had up to this point. [From.GetSheHeCap] was also happy to see [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName] riding by my side. This visit is certainly off to a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20069;Despite meeting [From.GetHerHim] with all the pomp a [From.GetTitle] deserves, [From.GetTitledFirstName] looked quite displeased after our first encounter. Perhaps something bad has happened during [From.GetHerHis] travel to put [From.GetHerHim] in such a bad mood. Hopefully I will have more chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20070;After my arrival at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s palace, I was pleased to see that my host had prepared a magnificent feast in my honor, providing me and my men with all sorts of food and entertainment. For the rest of the night after our arrival, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] Chieftains delighted us with the history of their tribes and their legendary ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20071;Looks like my efforts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a lavish feast were not in vain: my guest looked very satisfied of the food and entertainment I provided for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20072;Despite my best efforts, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look pleased by the feast I had prepared for [From.GetHerHim]. After eating only a little, [From.GetSheHe] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and retired to [From.GetHerHis] assigned chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20073;Having [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] in my court for a few days presents me with a great opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our realms. If I could convince [FromFrom.GetHerHim] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a civilized and respectable realm, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] might decide that it is in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] best interests to strengthen our alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by the complexity of the laws and customs of the locals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a distinguished and civilized ruler, very unlike the primitive chieftain I initially thought [From.GetHerHim] to be. It is clear to me now that helping [From.GetHerHim] to convert [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was not a wasted effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20075;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am becoming more and more convinced that the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must have converted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in name only. Despite my host's tireless efforts to convince me that [From.GetSheHe] is the ruler of a civilized and respectable realm, what I see is still a band of washed-up savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20100;While I have yet to cleanse myself from impurities after labor, [From.GetFirstName] should be baptized as soon as possible. Given that [From.GetSheHe] is the heir of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I should make sure that the rite celebrating [From.GetHerHis] coming into this world is as grandiose as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20101;Before I proceed with the initiation rites, I should select a godparent from the ranks of our Order to lead and protect [FromFrom.GetFirstName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] walks on the dark path I prepared for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will initiate little [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] to the dark rites from the cradle. I was offered the honor to accompany the child on [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] dark path as [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] god[Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20103;The secret gathering of hooded cultists surrounds the child, chanting obscene verses. As another innocent victim is bled dry over [baptizing_child.GetHerHim], little [baptizing_child.GetFirstName] is baptized in blood and darkness, forever bound to Lucifer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20104;The secret gathering of hooded cultists surrounds me, chanting obscene verses. As another innocent victim is bled dry over me, I am baptized in blood and darkness, forever bound to Lucifer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20106;The time has come to make [From.GetFirstName] aware of the illustrious future that the Light-bringer has in store for [From.GetHerHim]. I will introduce [From.GetHerHim] to the brotherhood tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20107;Tonight, [From.GetFirstName] woke me in the middle of my sleeping hours to drag me in a weird and secret place. [From.GetSheHeCap] introduced me to a group of strange, hooded people. They were all happy to see me, and told me that they expect great things from me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20108;[From.GetFirstName] should be baptized as soon as possible so that [From.GetHerHis] place in Heaven can be assured. Given that [From.GetSheHe] is a [From.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I should make sure that the rite celebrating [From.GetHerHis] coming into this world as a [Root.Religion.GetName] is as grandiose as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20112;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been suggesting for a few days now that, as a [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler, I am no longer under any obligation to allow the other Chieftains to determine how to divide my own lands once I die. [From.GetSheHeCap] assures me that I am well within my right to pass down my titles directly to my children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20113;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks that, by spreading the word about my recent conversion to other [Root.Religion.GetName] realms, I will be able to significantly increase the prosperity of [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF20114;There are many valuable texts that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [From.GetHerHim] when moving to [Root.Capital.GetName]. Today, [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I was interested in learning more about [Root.Religion.GetName] arts and laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF20067;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to come meet me a few days from the capital to formally and personally welcome me to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Seeing my host come meet me in person has certainly been an appreciated gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Hopefully I will have more chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20070;My arrival at [From.Capital.GetName] was graced by sumptuous parade organized by [From.GetTitledFirstName] in my honor. Watching the lines of warriors and chieftains chanting and marching through the street to lead me to my host's palace was quite the spectacle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20071;Looks like my efforts to impress [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a great parade in [From.GetHerHis] honor were not in vain: my guest looked very satisfied of the spectacle I provided for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20072;Despite my best efforts, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look pleased by the parade I had prepared for [From.GetHerHim]. After watching the spectacle only for a while, [From.GetSheHe] excused [From.GetHerselfHimself] and retired to [From.GetHerHis] assigned chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by strength and complex hierarchy of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s army. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a distinguished and honorable warrior, very unlike the primitive chieftain I initially thought [From.GetHerHim] to be. It is clear to me now that helping [From.GetHerHim] to convert [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was not a wasted effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20075;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am becoming more and more convinced that the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must have converted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in name only.

EVTDESCBHF20101;After news spread about the grandiose ceremony I am preparing for [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s baptism, several of my subjects clamored to be chosen as the child's godparent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20102;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to organize a lavish ceremony to accompany [From.GetHerHis] [FromFromFrom.GetSonDaughter]'s baptism, and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to grant me the honor of being the child's god[Root.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20103;[scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] washes the child three times over, reciting a prayer to protect [baptizing_child.GetHerHis] soul, surrounded by a host of cardinals. Then [scoped_pope.GetSheHe] raises little [baptizing_child.GetFirstName] up for all the crowd gathered in the great cathedral to see, exposing [baptizing_child.GetHerHim] to the cheers of [baptizing_child.GetHerHis] future subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF20103_CURSED;Surrounded by Cardinals [scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] washes the child three times over, while reciting the prayer to protect [baptizing_child.GetHerHis] soul. Yet, as [scoped_pope.GetSheHe]  raises little [baptizing_child.GetFirstName] for the crowd to see, there is no cheering to drown the child’s crying. The holy water appears to have burned [baptizing_child.GetHerHis] skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF20104_CURSED;[scoped_pope.GetTitledFirstName] washes me three times over in an accursed basin, ignoring my protests as [scoped_pope.GetSheHe] recites an unbearable litany. Then, as [scoped_pope.GetSheHe] raises me up, exposing me to the cheers of all of my future subjects, the holy water burns painfully through my skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF20067;I was surprised to see [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName], the [Root.Culture.GetName] priest I had sent to help [From.GetTitledFirstName] some time ago, ride to officially welcome me to [convert_lord_spiritual.GetHerHis] new liege's realm. Although seeing a familiar face is a nice surprise, I cannot deny a tinge of annoyance learning that my host has not come to welcome me in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20068;Sending [convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledName] to meet [From.GetTitledFirstName] was not a bad idea. I just received a report from the priest telling me that his former liege was glad to be welcomed by a familiar face. This visit is certainly off to a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20069;Despite sending one of [From.GetHerHis] own countrymen to meet [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledFirstName] looked quite displeased at [From.GetHerHis] arrival. Perhaps something bad has happened during [From.GetHerHis] travel to put [From.GetHerHim] in such a bad mood. Hopefully I will have more chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20070;I was not happy to discover that my host had only organized a small banquet in honor of my arrival. While I appreciated eating at least some decent food after the long travel, it hardly felt like a feast fit for a [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20071;Despite my lack of preparation, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too upset to see that I had only prepared a meager feast for [From.GetHerHis] arrival. Perhaps, after the hardships of the travel, [From.GetSheHe] was just happy to finally sleep under a roof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20072;Unfortunately, it appears that my lack of effort in the preparation for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s welcoming feast did not go unnoticed. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] looked clearly upset to be presented with little food and no entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by the complexity of the laws and customs of the locals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a distinguished and civilized ruler, very unlike the primitive chieftain I initially thought [From.GetHerHim] to be.

EVTDESCCHF20104;[scoped_bishop.GetTitledFirstName] washes me three times over, reciting a prayer to protect my soul, then [scoped_bishop.GetSheHe] raises me up for all the crowd gathered in the church to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHA20076;Thanks to my continuous efforts, I seem to have convinced [From.GetTitledFirstName] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a respectable and powerful realm, one that no [From.Religion.GetName] [From.GetTitle] would be ashamed to call an ally.\nWith [From.GetHerHis] visit nearing its end, this might be my last chance to ensure the continued alliance of our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20077;Despite my continuous efforts to prove otherwise, I have been unable to convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is a respectable and powerful realm, one that has abandoned its tribal roots entirely.\nYet, with [From.GetHerHis] visit nearing its end, this might be my last chance to ensure the continued alliance of our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20078;Only a few days before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] has surprised me with a bold request: [From.GetSheHe] wishes to bind [From.GetHerHis] realm with mine by marrying me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20079;Only a few days before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] graces me with an unexpected private meeting in my chambers. After hesitating about the subject of [From.GetHerHis] visit for a while, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] finally confesses that, during these past days, [From.GetSheHe] has developed a deep affection for me and wishes to know if I feel the same about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20080;With only a few days left before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] took some time during our last dinner together to ask me if, after learning more about [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] realm, I have come to consider [From.GetHerHim] a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20081;With only a few days left before my departure from [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] took some time during our last dinner together to tell me how honored [From.GetSheHe] was to host a guest as distinguished as myself and that [From.GetSheHe] hopes this will not be the last time we meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20082;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was thrilled by my marriage proposal, so much so that [From.GetSheHe] insisted we organized the ceremony in [Root.Capital.GetName] immediately. With this union, an alliance between [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been ensured for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20083;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] politely rejected my proposal before excusing [From.GetHerselfHimself] and leaving. With [From.GetHerHis] refusal the chance to bind our realms together permanently has passed me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20084;I was relieved to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] does reciprocates my feelings for [From.GetHerHim]. We spent our last night together consuming our passion, thus ensuring the continued alliance between our two realms, just in time for [From.GetHerHis] departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20085;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] politely rejected my advances before excusing [From.GetHerselfHimself] and leaving. With [From.GetHerHis] refusal the chance to bind our realms together permanently has passed me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20086;I was glad to hear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] considers [From.GetHerselfHimself] a friend of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], just as I consider myself a friend of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Hopefully, our relationship will ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for both our realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20087;Unfortunately, despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to assure me that we are not enemies, I remain doubtful of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s friendship. I am afraid our realms may not remain at peace for long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20088;It has finally come the time for the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to leave [Root.Capital.GetName] and return to [From.GetHerHis] realm. I can only hope that, during [From.GetHerHis] visit, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to appreciate me and my people and that [From.GetSheHe] will now see us as more than simple tribal converts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHA20089;The time has finally come for me to leave [From.Capital.GetName] and return to my own realm. Living with [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s tribes was certainly an interesting experience. By going to personally meet the new converts, I truly have done everything in my power to put these pagans on the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20067;Despite having made our presence quite apparent and being now only a few days from [From.Capital.GetName], no welcoming party was sent from the capital to greet me. I am not sure if [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s rudeness is a result of ignorance or spite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20068;Despite lacking any proper welcome party, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] did not look particularly displeased when [From.GetSheHe] finally reached the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], at least according to the reports I received from my courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20069;According to my courtiers' reports, [From.GetTitledFirstName] looked quite displeased to not see me ride out to welcome [From.GetHerHim] officially. Hopefully I will have other chances to make up for the less than ideal start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20070;I was not happy to discover that my host had not prepared anything for my arrival at [From.Capital.GetName]. Especially after the long travel, I was hoping to have at least some decent food, rather than be shown immediately to my chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20071;Despite my lack of preparation, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too upset to see that I had nothing prepared for [From.GetHerHis] arrival. Perhaps, after the hardships of the travel, [From.GetSheHe] was just happy to finally sleep under a roof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20072;Predictably, the complete lack of preparation for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s arrival did not go unnoticed. The [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was quite upset to discover no feast nor celebration had been organized for [From.GetHerHis] arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20074;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am more and more surprised by how eagerly and thoroughly have the locals embraced their new religion. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has revealed [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a pious and devout [From.Religion.GetName], very unlike the primitive chieftain I initially thought [From.GetHerHim] to be. It is clear to me now that helping [From.GetHerHim] to convert [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was not a wasted effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF20075;As days pass by in [From.Capital.GetName] I am becoming more and more convinced that the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must have converted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in name only. Despite my host's tireless efforts to convince me that [From.GetSheHe] is the ruler of a civilized and respectable realm, what I see is still a band of washed-up savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF20000;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\nI wish to forsake my old religion and lead [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to its rightful place amongst the civilized realms.\nI humbly request [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s assistance to ensure a peaceful transition into the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20001;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI sympathize with your dream of a [From.Religion.GetName] [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but I am afraid I cannot aid you in your mission at this moment.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20002;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI am honored to accept your plea to help the poor people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] see the light and embrace the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.\nWe will begin preparations for a great conversion immediately.\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20007;My [Root.GetTitle], \nI have long thought about your request and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot abandon our ancestors' gods. I will not attend your great conversion, nor will any of my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20009;[Root.GetTitledName],\nOur [converting_king.GetTitle] has decreed that all [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is to be [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].\nI urge you to join me at [converting_king.Capital.GetName], where we will all officially convert to the new faith.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20010;Not only has [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] forsaken the old gods and the sacred traditions of my ancestors by embracing a strange and new religion, [converting_king.GetSheHe] has also fallen under the influence of a foreign ruler, the [sponsoring_king.GetTitle] who converted [converting_king.GetHerHim].\n[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] has proven to be a traitor to [converting_king.GetHerHis] people as well as a weak ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20011;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s stubbornness in clinging to the old faith has become more than a simple nuisance. \nMany have reported [From.GetHerHim] claiming that I am a traitor to my people and that I have sold off [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName].\nThere's little doubt [From.GetFirstName] has become my enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20013;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName] turned away from [From.GetHerHis] own faith!\n[From.GetSheHeCap] is still willing to sponsor the mass conversion of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20015;With the unfortunate departure of [From.GetTitledFirstName] so goes the support of [From.GetHerHis] realm for the conversion of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. \nI will need to find someone else to help me in this endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20017;It appears that [From.GetTitledFirstName] died before [From.GetSheHe] could achieve salvation for [From.GetHerselfHimself] as well as [From.GetHerHis] people. \nThe great ceremony for the mass conversion of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been postponed indefinitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20019;It seems [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s conviction was not as firm as [From.GetSheHe] claimed.\nI have just learned that [From.GetSheHe] has forsaken the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith to become a [From.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20021;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName], the [From.GetManWoman] who helped me spread the new religion all across my realm, has abandoned that very religion in favor of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20023;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName], the [From.GetManWoman] who helped me spread the new faith across your realm, has died. \nWithout [From.GetHerHis] assistance, I am not sure I would have been able to tame the tribes of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and drag them to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20024;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\nThe words of your missionary have convinced me to forsake my old religion and lead [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to its rightful place amongst the civilized realms.\nI humbly request [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s assistance to ensure a peaceful transition into the [Root.Religion.GetName]'s faith.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20025;[Root.GetTitledName],\nOur [converting_king.GetTitle] has decreed that all [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is to be [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].\nI have decided to take a stand for our old gods and deny [converting_king.GetHerHis] request. I urge you to do the same.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20028;[Root.GetTitledName],\nOur [converting_king.GetTitle] has decreed that all [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is to be [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].\nWe cannot oppose [converting_king.GetHerHis] decision openly, but I believe that, together, we may keep our gods' memory alive in secret.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20029;Some time has passed since the great conversion.\nIt is clear now that the followers of the old faith have no place in [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s new realm. The more I wait, the stronger will be the sway of the [converting_king.Religion.GetName] clergy over my people. \nWe must act now if we wish to reclaim our lands for the old gods and break the shackles of the new religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20030;To all the followers of the true gods of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!\nOur [converting_king.GetTitle] has forsaken the old ways and sold [converting_king.GetHerHis] beliefs to a foreign [sponsoring_king.GetTitle]. We must stand together and break the shackles of the perverse [converting_king.Religion.GetName] faith!\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20031;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has rallied [From.GetHerHis] tribes and declared open war against all followers of [converting_king.Religion.GetHighGodName] in [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a last ditch effort to preserve [From.GetHerHis] backwards, dying religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20032;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] decided to abandon [From.GetHerHis] faith in the middle of the preparations for the mass conversion of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!\nFollowing this unforeseen event, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had no other option but to cancel the whole ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20033;News have reached court about [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s passing.\nWithout [FromFrom.GetHerHis] support, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had no other choice but to hold off the ceremony for the mass conversion of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], at least until [From.GetSheHe] finds another respected [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] ruler to support [From.GetHerHim] in this project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20035;To [From.GetHerHis] last breath my [GetFromRelation] opposed our liege's decision to abandon the old faith. With the mass conversion only a few days away, I must decide if I wish to follow in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s footsteps or bow to the will of my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20036;In order to help my subjects to better understand their new responsibilities as [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] converts, [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a knowledgeable priest to [Root.Capital.GetName]. He will be a great addition to the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20039;It has been some time since the great ceremony. \nMy conversion to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been an eye-opening experience. Abandoning the old gods has made me realize how much more purpose my life can have while serving [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Everyday I am amazed by how different everything looks through my new [Root.Religion.GetName] perspective...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20040;The more I think about the great conversion, the more doubt gnaws at my mind. [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests put up a nice spectacle, but even after converting your entire realm, there was no miracle, no divine revelation to reward your accomplishment. The peasants still toil in the fields, the chieftains still squabble amongst themselves. \nNothing changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20041;Becoming a [Root.Religion.GetName] has forced me to rethink a lot of my life choices. \nMy conversion will have been for nothing if I do not strive to better serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and my [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20042;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. \nBeing lectured day and night by all these old men of the cloth is making me realize how little I know about [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and of my new responsibilities as a [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20043;I have had a lot of time to meditate about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] since my conversion. \nKnowing that I still have to prove myself before my new protector has filled me with a divine resolve to test my mettle against the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20044;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. If there is one thing that they all agree upon, it is how beneficial it would be for the salvation of my soul to regularly and generously invest more of my material gains in the newly established religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20045;Since the day of the great conversion, I have spent many hours listening to [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, learning more about my newly acquired faith. \nAll this time away from the excesses of the life at the [Root.GetHouse] has forced me to limit my diet to a couple of scarce meals per day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20046;There is still much that I have to learn about being a [Root.Religion.GetName], but, thanks to the help of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, I feel I am every day a little closer to understanding how to properly serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20047;Although the great conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was a success, my work to help [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s savage people to turn them into proper [Root.Religion.GetName] converts is not done yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20048;After helping them see the light of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and their [converting_king.GetTitle] have often been in my thoughts. \nPerhaps visiting [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] could help improve the relations between our realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20049;[Root.GetTitledName],\nWe have decided to help you in your holy quest to turn your subjects to the true faith by funding the construction of a new church in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20050;[Root.GetTitledName], \nI am glad to read of your decision. A new church is just what we needed to help spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to the masses. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20051;[Root.GetTitledName], \nI appreciate your thought, but I must refuse your proposal: maintaining a new church would be no easy task, even if its construction was covered by your generous offer. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20052;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIn order to assist you in the conversion of your lands to the rightful worship of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName], we have decided to send you a modest sum of gold from Our royal coffers. \n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20053;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\nYour generous offer was much appreciated. You can rest assured that your gold will be dutifully invested to spread the holy message of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20054;[Root.GetTitledName],\nIn an effort to assist you in the conversion of your realm, we have decided to send more of Our missionaries to your lands. They will be sure to rectify the path of the few remaining wayward subjects.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20057;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI was glad for the arrival of your missionaries. The sooner all of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] becomes [Root.Religion.GetName] the better for everyone.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20058;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI am afraid I have had to send your missionaries back without allowing them to fulfill their task. Tensions are still high after the great ceremony, and I do not wish to stir the peasants into open rebellion.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20059;Missionaries from [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have arrived at [From.GetName]. Acting with the approval of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], these priests have spent the last days convincing the inhabitants of the province to abandon their old faith and become proper [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20060;Thanks to the efforts of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s missionaries, the people of [From.GetName] have abandoned their old pagan beliefs and embraced the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20061;Missionaries from [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have arrived at [From.GetName]. Acting with the approval of [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], these priests have spent the last days convincing the inhabitants of the province to abandon their old faith and become proper [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName]. \nUnfortunately, their harsh methods and lack of understanding of the customs of our lands have led them to stir up trouble with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20062;Thanks to the efforts of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s missionaries, the people of [From.GetName] have finally abandoned their old pagan beliefs and embraced the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith. \nUnfortunately, their harsh methods and lack of understanding of the customs of our lands have led them to stir up trouble with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20063;[Root.GetTitledName],\nWe are happy to announce Our impending visit to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. It has been some time now since your conversion to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, and we are eager to meet you in person and see your realm now that it is properly civilized.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20064;There is still some time to prepare for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s unexpected visit. This meeting presents me with a great opportunity to improve my relationship with the [FromFrom.GetTitle] of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. I should be careful not to squander it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20065;Traveling to the tribal realm of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been a reinvigorating experience for me. With only a small escort, I have left the familiar sights of my homeland to visit a more savage region of the known world, only to help spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. I cannot wait to witness the effects of the mass conversion on [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20066;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s party has finally been spotted in my provinces. Though [From.GetSheHe] knows the way to [Root.Capital.GetName], it might help to have somebody go meet up with [From.GetHerHim] and officially welcome [From.GetHerHim] to [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20092;I have waited long enough. It is time to make my intentions clear and break the shackles of the new faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20096;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName], the wise pagan ruler who petitioned me to help [From.GetHerHim] convert [From.GetHerHis] realm, has died. \nI can only hope that [From.GetHerHis] successor be as enlightened as [From.GetSheHe] was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20098;Unfortunately, it appears that [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] has fallen gravely ill and is unable to perform is duties as host any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20099;My guest, [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName], has fallen gravely ill and was forced to return back home before the end of [sponsoring_king.GetHerHis] visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20003;The conversion of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] starts on a cold morning.\nThe Bishop leading [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s embassy meets you at a river near the city. Your faithful vassals stand beside you, while the rest of your subjects wait their turn behind them, looking still visibly confused. The Bishop recites a few verses from [catholic.GetScriptureName] before you lead your vassals into the river. As you pass the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests they baptize you, one after the other, in the cold water. It takes some prodding from the guards to convince the peasants to follow you into the water, but, after a while, the entire crowd stands soaked and shaking by the riverside, just in time to watch the priests and their helpers drop your old idols into the waves.\n"As the false visages are swallowed by the tides" the Bishop proclaims, "may their memory forever be banished from your soul.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20004;You receive news from your missionaries only a few days after the mass baptism of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]. Although the priest writes that he does not feel entirely convinced about the sincerity of the barbarians' conversion, the ceremony went well and [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is now officially [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName].\nBy aiding in the conversion of an entire score of pagans to the One True Faith, you have accomplished a feat worthy of the Apostles themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20005;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI have decided to abandon my old beliefs and embrace the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith.\nAs I care much for the salvation of all my subjects, I urge you to join me in [From.Capital.GetName], and renounce your old faith, alongside all the people of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nSincerely, \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20006;My [Root.GetTitle],\nI am overjoyed to hear of your conversion to the [From.Religion.GetName].\nI had long since prayed for you to see the light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20008;The conversion of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] starts on a cold morning.\nThe Bishop leading [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s embassy meets your liege at a river near the city. You stand beside [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName], while [converting_king.GetHerHis] subjects wait their turn behind you, looking still visibly confused.The Bishop recites a few verses from the Bible, then [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] leads you all in the river while the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] priests baptize you as you pass by them.

EVTDESCHFA20090;The tribes of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have been converted to the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith. A group of priests sent by the [sponsoring_king.GetTitle] of [sponsoring_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have performed a great ritual during which they have converted the entire population of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] alongside [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] and many of [converting_king.GetHerHis] vassals.\nWith this act, the people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have once and for all forsaken their old pagan gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20093;I have received news of the Mass Conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20094;To the Exalted [Root.GetTitledName],\nHaving taken into consideration your actions to convert the heathens of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName], We have decided to welcome you back in the warm and holy embrace of Our Mother Church.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20115;After having examined the state of [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] assures me that there are several ways in which I can improve our way of life, simply by adopting some of the tools and laws followed by most [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20116;I have heard [From.GetTitledFirstName] talking about the customs of other [From.Religion.GetName] [From.Culture.GetName] rulers for quite some time now since [From.GetHerHis] arrival, to the point that I have started to feel allured by some of the customs of the [From.Culture.GetName] people, just as much as I was of their religion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20117;A group of militant faithful have come to [Root.Capital.GetName], attracted by the sermons of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Although foreigners, these warriors appear to be willing to join my army and help me spread the word of [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20118;[convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] has been insisting for a while now that a baptism requires me to adopt a new, proper [Root.Religion.GetName] name in order to truly prove my newfound faith in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20119;Under pressure from [From.GetHerHis] new priest, my [GetFromRelation] has decided to adopt a new name after [From.GetHerHis] recent conversion and now calls [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has invited all of [From.GetHerHis] family to follow [From.GetHerHim] in this chance to fully embrace the new religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB20003;You meet with your vassals and [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s Imams in the middle of [converting_king.Capital.GetName]'s square.\nAddressing the crowd of commoners gathered all around you, you publicly denounce the old gods and spit on their false idols, gesturing for your vassals to do the same. A few complaints rise from the crowd, but they are swiftly quelled. Then, as the Imams set fire to the icons, you declare your faith to Allah and to His Prophet.\nYou all turn your back to the pyre of false gods and bow to Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20004;Although the Prophet often spread His Word by the sword, it is a commendable feat for you to have converted an entire score of pagans through words only. \nYou have no doubts that infidels still hide in [converting_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s domain, but now that the ruling class has been brought into the light, it is only a matter of time until everybody else in the realm follows. With the mass conversion of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetTitle] to [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName], you have brought the universal rule of Islam over the world one step closer to its completion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20005;[Root.GetTitledName],\nNo longer will my [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] subjects have to live in fear under backwards [converting_king.Religion.GetName] rulers.\nI have contacted the wise [sponsoring_king.GetTitledName] and, with the help of [sponsoring_king.GetHerHis] priests, I am preparing to convert the entirety of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith. \n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20006;My [Root.GetTitle],\nFor many years I have looked at the followers of [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetHighGodName] with a sympathetic eye. You cannot imagine what a relief it is to hear of your conversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB20096;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName], the wise pagan ruler who petitioned me to help [From.GetHerHim] convert [From.GetHerHis] realm, has died. \nIt is very unfortunate that [From.GetHerHis] passing would happen just when I decided to visit [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20118;[convert_lord_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] has been insisting for a while now that a conversion requires me to adopt a new, proper [Root.Religion.GetName] name in order to truly prove my newfound faith in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFC20003;The hooded priests from [sponsoring_king.Capital.GetName] arrive at dawn, but the ceremony begins only after sunset, once they have helped the icons of the new gods adjust to their new home in your temple.\nYou meet with your vassals outside the city, a crowd of your subjects assembling all around you, and then, under the grim echoes of drums and horns, the Germanic priests begin the rite. They paint your faces with the blood of the sacrificial lambs, burn sacred herbs and chant their secret spells, as you all enter a trance.\nVisions of horror and delight accompany you for the rest of the night. When you wake at dawn of the next day, the priests are already gone. Little by little, the confused crowd of converts returns to [converting_king.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20004;The priests you have sent to [converting_king.Capital.GetName] return home exhausted and satisfied. \nThe people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have fully embraced their new gods. Their warriors will surely make a fine addition to Odin's army in Valhalla for the final war to come. \nWith your actions you have gained another ally in the eternal fight against the bringers of the end times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20006;My [Root.GetTitle],\nWhat you ask of me is not easy, but I will not deny your request. I will join you at [Root.Capital.GetName] and convert to the [sponsoring_king.Religion.GetName] faith with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFD20003;Following the instructions of [sponsoring_king.GetTitledFirstName]'s priests, you assemble your vassals and ride out of [converting_king.Capital.GetName] on your best horse.\nThe Tengri priests lead you away from the civilized roads, deep into the wilderness, refusing to answer to any query about your destination.\nAfter riding for the entire day, you stop at the edge of a cliff, looking at the bleeding hues of the sunset. The priests burn a few offerings of food to the sky god, creating a large line of dark smoke from a small set of fires. Then, as their chants echo through the air, you ride with your vassals through the smoke and cleanse yourself of the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFD20004;The priests sent to introduce Tengri to the strange people of [converting_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have returned bringing good news. \n[converting_king.GetTitledFirstName] has sealed [converting_king.GetHerHis] allegiance with the sky god and the spirits of your ancestors and now [converting_king.GetHerHis] whole people ride under their protection. \nAs long as they will follow the rite and placate the spirits, they have opened themselves a road to a bright and prosperous future under the Great Blue Sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
