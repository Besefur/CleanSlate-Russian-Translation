EVTDESC70000;A courier has come forth inviting all knights of the realm to attend a grand tournament, the like of which is only seen once per reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70001;It is time to let the tournament begin and for the next two months let all show their martial brilliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70002;The tournament is over and now it is time to bask in the glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70003;The Tournament ends and although I may not have won any of the melee events my prowess did not go unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70004;The Tournament ends and I have shown time and time again that my glory in arms, even if I did not win I still covered myself in glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70005;The Tournament ends and it was a terrible moment, but it was one time only. I still hear their laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70006;The Tournament ends and I was vanquished in the early rounds. Personally I blame my squire, but people did not see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70007;The Tournament ends and although I did not win I felt many lessons were learnt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70008;The Tournament ends and my tactics were poor, people doubt my abilities now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70009;I felt my armor was strong and my training was first rate. Sadly it failed and I felt the icy chill as the steel carved into my flesh. My eyes grew heavy and sight grew dim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70010;The melee was going well when the mace came crashing down upon me, I managed to block it but my shield shatter under the force of the blow. The next swing came crashing down and the darkness overtook me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70011;I sought out a worthy foe man in the melee, but he came upon me and I parried the first thrust. The follow up was too quick for me and a jolt of pain shot through my body. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70012;We advanced forth into the Melee, but then I saw our foes and suddenly my bowels loosened and guts turned to water. My comrades all looked on me in disgust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70013;The melee was fought and I went boldly forth, while other stood back I charged forth headless of my own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70014;People felt my leadership skills were poor, some even called me misguided.  Then the tide of the melee turned  but in the heat of battle my voice rose above the others and my direction  turned the tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70015;I have been long renowned for my roughness, but in the recent melee the enemy took us by surprise and yet I still lead from the front and steered us to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70016;The melee was challenging and my skills were renowned. Our valiant foe men were had prepared well but if it wasn't a moment of brilliance by myself they would of triumphed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70017;I am known for my brilliance but the enemy had developed a counter. Word has spread and my brilliance is diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70018;My skills are well known, but it seems there is a counter. More have heard about it. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70019;In a recent melee the toughness I habitually show has been proven to be misguided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70020;Victory is mine, I triumphed in several Melee's proving once and for all that I am the champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70021;Although I was not triumphant in the many melee's I was good enough to be declared second.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70022;A honorable third place was the result of my efforts in the Melee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70023;I was taking part in the tournament and enjoying the camaraderie with the other entrants when a queer feeling came over me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70024;Tournaments are such fun, and it is not just the taking part it is all the other entertainments available. Then I noticed a strange sore on my body in a place I would much rather not mention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70025;The tournament did not go well, but not badly either. I had prepared for months for this and at the end of the day I was simply not good enough. I had turned to solace in drink. When it was over a few morning later I felt terrible and the hair of the dog seemed like the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70026;While I was at the tournament some lower class type with pretensions insulted my honor. I could only do what a man of my class could do and challenged him to a duel. Naturally he was no match for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70027;I was at the tournament and although I did not have an opportunity to distinguish myself in the melee I was sitting around and listening two knights plot together to advantage themselves in the next bought. I listened carefully to their plan and I instantly saw the flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70028;I was at the tournament and although I did not have an opportunity to distinguish myself in the melee, I was sitting around and listening to two knights plot together to advantage themselves in the next bought. I offered some advice, how was I supposed to know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70029;While at the tournament I was listening to some lesser Lordling describe how he collected tithes from his serfs. As I listened I realized he was giving his serf plenty of ways of avoiding giving their due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70030;While at the tournament I joined in a conversation with other Lords on how best to collect tithes. I saw a far easier way and it caused quite an argument with many Lords disagreeing with my stance, but the more I talked the more I convinced myself that I was right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70031;I was simply passing time at the tournament when I saw two knights argue over honor. I knew straight away that the argument was spurious and the result would be unnecessary bloodshed. So I stepped in and prevented it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70032;I was simply passing time at the tournament when I saw two knights argue over honor. I knew straight away that the argument was spurious and the result would be unnecessary bloodshed. I attempted to mediate the dispute and they told me that at least one of the knights should survive the resulting duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70033;I have sent forth messengers around the realm to spread the word that a grand tournament be held;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70034;[From.GetTitledName] has been crowned the winner of my grand tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70035;[From.GetTitledName]'s bravery won [From.GetHerHim] second place in my grand tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70036;[From.GetTitledName] fought [From.GetHerHis] way to the third place in my grand tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70037;The grand tournament of [From.GetTitledName] has been cancelled due to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70038;My liege! Your guest [From.GetTitledName] has tragically been killed during the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70039;My liege! Your guest [From.GetTitledName] has tragically been maimed during the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70040;My liege! Your guest [From.GetTitledName] has tragically been wounded during the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70041;As I draw my last breath I remember the tournament. Alas, my death will set stop for the festivities and I grieve for myself, to think I will never be allowed to see brave knights fight for glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70042;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], due to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s untimely death the tournament unfortunately has been cancelled.\n\nSigned, \n[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100420;I am absolutely certain my rival is cheating in the tournament! There's no way he could win his fights so easily if he wasn't cheating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100421;My liege, I have proof one of the participants in the tournament is cheating!'\nThe rivalry between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and the supposed cheater is well known, but I can't imagine [From.GetTitledFirstName] would lie about something this serious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100422;The tournament was well on its way when [From.GetTitledFirstName], aggravated by [From.GetHerHis] losses at the list field where we both took part in the jousting, accused me of cheating and presented a ridiculous theory [From.GetSheHe] claimed proved I cheated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100423;Everyone at the tournament [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] hosted heard [From.GetTitledFirstName] accusing me of cheating in the tournament. I did not think any one would believe [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s wild accusations, but the suspicious looks and the whispered gossip told me otherwise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100424;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] accused me of cheating in the tournament and [From.GetTitledFirstName] believed [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. I was thrown in jail based on unwarranted accusations from a rival of mine - [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100425;The false accusations from [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] about me cheating in the tournament was groundless but [From.GetTitledFirstName] believed every poisonous word that idiot told [From.GetHerHim]. Despite my protests and demands of a fair trial where [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] could present [FromFrom.GetHerHis] so-called 'evidence' [From.GetTitledFirstName] chose to banish me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100426;After I told [From.GetTitledFirstName] about my rival cheating in the tournament I eagerly waited for [From.GetHerHis] reaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100427;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s face turned red and [From.GetSheHe] started sputtering swearwords when I accused [From.GetHerHim] of cheating in the tournament. I had made sure I made the accusations where as many people as possible could hear it, something I came to regret quickly when [From.GetTitledFirstName] challenged me to a duel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100428;I defended my honor in the only way possible: I challenged [From.GetTitledFirstName] to a duel in front of all the tournament participants, the spectators and our host, [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. No one calls me a cheater and gets away with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100429;It was as I thought, [From.GetTitledFirstName] was all talk and no spine. Coward! [From.GetTitledFirstName] hastily withdrew [From.GetHerHis] unwarranted accusations when I threatened to punch [From.GetHerHis] teeth down [From.GetHerHis] throat in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA70008;Oh Dear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70009;Then I died;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70010; When I awoke I was maimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70011;The Wound, the  wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70012;My cheeks burned in shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70013;They were all in awe with my manliness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70014;I showed my toughness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70015;My skill shined through;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70016;I was brilliant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA70022;Good but not quite good enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70023;I dare not speak its name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70024;Probably nothing to worry about;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70025;One more drink won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70026;I learnt something about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70027;Intriguing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70028;Oops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70029;I kept this knowledge to myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA70037;Then my bravery will be shown in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70038;Most unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70041;I hope my subjects will remember me as a benevolent ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70042;And I had so looked forward to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA100425;When I get back, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will never be safe again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100426;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to do nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100427;I accept, but don't you cheat this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100428;I fear... I lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100429;I should have done it anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB70000;A foolish risk for fleeting glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB70001;Sadly a small war will delay this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB70038;Don't bother me with such details!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100420;I'll confront him myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100421;Banish the cheater;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100422;Your 'evidence' is dishonoring, I challenge you to a duel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100423;Why should I care what they think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100426;[From.GetTitledFirstName] imprisoned the cheater!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100427;I jest, I jest! Please don't hit me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100428;I proved my innocence when [From.GetSheHe] lay unconscious on the ground by my feet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC100420;Everyone must know what a cheater he is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
