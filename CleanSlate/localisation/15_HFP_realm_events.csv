EVTDESC_HFP_40000;Years have passed with great fortunes and trading across the Baltic Sea, and the great [Root.Culture.GetName] cities in Holstein and Mecklenburg have grown into wealth and expanded considerably.\n\n[Root.Liege.GetBestName] have given us the right of becoming Free Imperial Cities of the Empire. With my seat at [Root.Capital.GetName], I have become the new Mayor of the Hanseatic League, a large Merchant Republic that will span the entire Northern Seas.\n\nWith [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] at our back, we will grow to become a major player in the Empire. The petty feudal princes of old will bow down before us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40001;Several German merchant guilds and trade cities along the shores of northern Europe have come together in LÃ¼beck to form the Hanseatic League with the blessing of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. This loose confederation of Free Imperial Cities is dedicated towards the continued prosperity of its members and the mutual defense of any merchant vassals flying its flag. Their eventual and unstated goal, of course, is to one day completely dominate all trade along the Baltic and North Seas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40010;For a long time, the cities around the central Alps have been threatened by other actors inside the Empire. All our cities have the honor of imperial immediacy, and we have agreed to come together to defend one another. No longer will we stand alone in the face of these threats, but rather we will stand together as a stronger faction.\n\nI have been chosen as the head of this confederation, as the one who will be the figurehead of all the Cantons of our new Swiss Confederation. No longer will we be threatened by outsiders, but rather be a strong independent actor in the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40012;A new entity known as the Swiss Confederation has risen in the Empire. They are a conglomeration of cities with imperial immediacy settled around the central Alps, and they have entered a defensive alliance to protect themselves from the other electors around them.\n\nAn independent force to be reckoned with, they have broken free from any prior claims to their lands, be it from the old Burgundians to the west or the German lords to the north\n\nI should look out for this new potential threat in the Empire. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40013;The city of Antioch was originally raised by Seleucus in Alexander's time, and was under [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] control for centuries before the infidel onslaught took control of it. Finally, you have restored the ancient city to its true glory.\n\nWith Antioch back in Christian hands, it is only a matter of time before all of ancient Christendom will be returned. The rest of the world is watching, as I am the forerunner of what is to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40014;The island of Cyprus stands at the precipice of the Holy Land, and with its return to the fold of Christianity, the path to the Holy City has once more opened.\n\nI have raised the new banner of Cyprus for the first time, and I look east to the lands of Jerusalem and Antioch. For too long, those lands were controlled by the enemies of the cross, but no more.\n\nThis is just the first of many victories. Everything will return to [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40015;For a long time the city of [Root.Capital.GetName] has flourished. Our grasp reaches across the Mediterranean, our traders rich and powerful in their roles.\n\nThe Feudal rulers of Europe has looked down upon us for centuries, but it is finally coming to an end as our potential for greatness is undisputed. The time of the old nobility is about to pass, and the mercantile era is beginning with the rise of our merchant class.\n\nWatch, my friends, my rivals, my countrymen, as I show the world the true strength of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40022;The [From.GetDukeDuchessCap] [From.GetFirstName] of [d_osterreich.GetName] has started calling [From.GetHerselfHimself] the [From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap] of [k_austria.GetName], and over time it has become normal to accept [From.GetHerHis] superiority over the other princes and princesses of the Empire. In a grand ceremony in [From.Capital.GetName], the title has finally become official.\n\nAs one of the prime electors of the Empire, [From.GetTitledName] has proved [From.GetHerHis] superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. The other lords and ladies of the Empire have grudgingly accepted it, looking towards [From.Capital.GetName] in envy. They will look for any opportunity to take [From.GetHerHim] down and raise their own positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40022_2;The [From.GetDukeDuchessCap] [From.GetFirstName] of [d_osterreich.GetName] has started calling [From.GetHerselfHimself] the [From.GetArchdukeArchduchessCap] of [k_austria.GetName], and over time it has become normal to accept [From.GetHerHis] superiority over the other princes and princesses of the Empire. In a grand ceremony in [From.Capital.GetName], the title has finally become official.\n\nAs one of the prime [From.GetLadiesLords] of the Empire, [From.GetTitledName] has proved [From.GetHerHis] superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. The other inferior members of the Empire have grudgingly accepted it, looking towards [From.Capital.GetName] in envy. They will look for any opportunity to take [From.GetHerHim] down and raise their own positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40023;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered all the [k_bavaria.GetAdjective] and [k_carinthia.GetAdjective] lands in under [From.GetHerHis] rule, and has raised the banner of a new Kingdom of [k_eastern_marches.GetName] to celebrate [From.GetHerHis] victories. This new Kingdom has become the new defacto leader of all the old eastern marches of the Empire.\n\nThis new Kingdom in the Empire is expected to be a power to be reckoned with. The old lands of [k_bavaria.GetName] and [k_carinthia.GetName] were well known for their strength and fortitude, and it is expected the new Kingdom will be all that and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40024;Once more the grand Byzantine banners of Constantinople have been raised. [From.GetDynName] has restored the old crown lands of Byzantium, and the Greek Empire rises from the ashes of defeat, to conquer its old enemies in both the east and the west.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire suffered defeat after defeat, finally falling to the throng of hostile states at its borders. But like the Rome of old, its enemies could not keep it from growing in power and becoming a relevant actor once more.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire is one and indivisible, all hail [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40025;Great [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\nIt feels me with hope and dedication towards the future, to once more see the Byzantine banners raised. If it would please you, I would do my utmost to serve you in these challenging times to come.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40026;I need to decide where to situate my new Kingdom. The old eastern margravates were all well known and powerful, and my decision will set certain expectations of what to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40027;Since the rise of the Prophet in Arabia, the Muslim faith has been a strong independent actor throughout the lands. [From.GetTitledFirstName] put an end to that, and the Muslim faith has been shattered by the latest advances of the [From.Religion.GetName]s.\n\nIn a grand announcement in front of [From.GetHerHis] castle in [From.Capital.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstName] declared all the infidel faiths dead, and that all the previous believers would be given a choice to convert to the true faith, or fear the [From.Religion.GetName] faith as it would crush them as it did the Muslims. Nowhere is safe from the Crusaders of [e_outremer.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40029;The [d_knights_calatrava.GetName] is the most recent addition to the soldiers of the Cross, founded by the magnanimous [From.GetTitledName]. Working out of the old Moslem castle in Calatrava, they will be one of the vanguards against the dangers to the faith, and make sure the Iberian peninsula never again fall to heathens and infidels.\n\nThough they are willing to follow the orders of [From.GetTitledName] for now, their loyalty lies with [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] first and foremost. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40030;This chivalric order owes its name to Santiago Matomoros, the legendary Saint appearing at the battle of Clavijo to help the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s against the Moslem infidels. The [d_knights_santiago.GetName] was formed by the benevolent [From.GetTitledName] in [From.GetHerHis] bountiful wisdom, and all its members have vowed to protect the pilgrims traveling the Way of Saint James.\n\nBlessed and sponsored by the [From.Religion.GetName] church itself, they will fight at the forefront of the struggles to keep Iberia [From.Religion.GetGroupName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40031;The Order of the Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem has been formed, sponsored by the [From.Religion.GetName] church and [From.GetTitledName]. The Teutonic Order primarily protect and care for pilgrims to the Holy Land, but will serve [From.Religion.GetName] rulers willing to pay for their upkeep.\n\nThough they only fight to protect the pilgrims for now, there is already ambitious murmurs in the order about what the future might bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40036;The Papacy long claimed to be the rightful heirs of the Romans, since they took control of the central regions of the Italian Peninsula. With the recent conquests of [From.GetTitledName], [From.GetSheHe] has claimed the regions for [From.GetHerselfHimself].\n\nThough the Pope has been raging about [k_papacy.Holder.GetHerHis] losses, and this affront to the Church, most lords and ladies throughout [k_papacy.Holder.GetHerHis] old lands have accepted the rule of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40037;Though [k_papacy.Holder.GetTitledName] fought long and hard for [k_papacy.Holder.GetHerHis] lands in the Italian Peninsula, [k_papacy.Holder.GetSheHe] has finally had to give up. With the losses, [k_papacy.Holder.GetSheHe] has also had to relinquish all their old claims to the Roman lands stretching throughout the peninsula.\n\nWithout the Papal influence throughout the peninsula, new conquerors and nobles will certainly try to fill the void left by the Holy See. The rulers and city-states throughout the lands, embrace for the conflicts that is sure to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_40038;After gathering the lands of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] under [From.GetHerHis] rule, [From.GetDynName] has declared [From.GetHerselfHimself] the Grand [From.GetDukeDuchessCap] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a grand ceremony that is sure to be remembered for many years to come.\n\nThe rest of the Princes of the Empire look to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with jealousy, as [From.GetTitledFirstName] will surely play an important role in the Empire with [From.GetHerHis] newfound rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_40000;We have a bright future ahead of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40001;That is bound to ruffle some feathers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40010;We will be safer as a unified group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_40022;It is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40023;Bow before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_40024;I will serve the true leader of Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_40023;An impressive feat, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40024;An undeserving false Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40026;[d_styria.GetName] is well known for its strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40027;We have to beware the Christians...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40029;More sheep to the slaughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40030;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40031;The infidels come in many flavors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40036;It was about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_40038;As is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_40024;Impressive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_40026;[k_bavaria.GetName] has always been the center of this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
