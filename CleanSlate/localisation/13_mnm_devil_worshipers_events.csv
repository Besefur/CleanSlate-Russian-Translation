EVTDESC_MNM_7001_A;I'm having dinner and plenty of drinks with [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledName] tonight. It's lovely, yet what I am most charmed by is [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] [satanists_recruiter.GetHerselfHimself]. Why else would I not immediately stop our conversation, which has slowly begun to touch upon some almost heretical ideas, questioning the salvation of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Why else would I not immediately stop our conversation, which has slowly begun to touch upon some unsavory and deviant topics about the primal needs of every [Root.GetManWoman]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7002_A;Meeting with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName], I made sure to only cautiously question the absolute power of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] almighty [satanists_recruit.Religion.GetHighGodName]... Thankfully, it seems that my carefully chosen words had the desired effect on [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim]. From [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] glittering eyes I got the distinct impression that [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] enjoyed the philosophical aspect of our conversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Regretfully, it seems that my words only irritated my [satanists_recruit.GetRootRelation] – from the steely look [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] finally gave me, I should probably steer clear of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim] for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7003_A;Walking the palisades of my [Root.GetCapitalHolding] I am joined by [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]. I find myself agreeing with a lot of the concepts [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] presents – the futility of prayer particularly resonates with me. Suddenly, [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] turns to me and presses a small leather pouch into my hand. "My [Root.GetLordLady], will you carry this with you, for protection?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7004_A;I've arranged a run-in with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] [satanists_recruit.GetCapitalHolding] today. [satanists_recruit.GetHerHisCap] face lights up upon seeing me and we stay out talking for hours. I offer [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim] a protection spell, in a leather pouch – of course, I do not explain the content... Yet [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] smiles, accepting the token.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7004_B;I've arranged a run-in with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] [satanists_recruit.GetCapitalHolding] today. [satanists_recruit.GetHerHisCap] face darkens when I again attempt to discuss my world views. I then offer [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim] my favorite protection spell, a chicken leg in a leather pouch – I thought it was harmless enough, but [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] refuses to accept the gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7005;"What if I told you that all you have been taught to believe in is a lie?" [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] continues, throwing a cautious glance around us before pulling up [satanists_recruiter.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing a scar in the shape of a pentagram. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied to Adam in the Garden of Eden. Reject the Tyrant deity and let [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] guide your steps...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] continues, throwing a cautious glance around us before pulling up [satanists_recruiter.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing a scar in the shape of [satanists_recruiter.GetDWDevil]'s mark. "I can show you a world of pure passion where your every pleasure is distilled to its purest form...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7006;When I revealed the brand on my lower arm, expecting the final hook to sink in, [satanists_recruit.GetFirstName] staggered backwards in shock and made a hand gesture for protection. "That is blasphemy, [Root.GetFirstName]" [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] said, eyes wide. "Leave my sight, before I call the guards!" [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] called and it was with reluctance, albeit hastily, that I left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7007;When I proceeded to reveal the brand on my lower arm, certain that the final hook would sink in, [satanists_recruit.GetFirstName] inhaled sharply, worrying me for a second. "You truly are a [Root.GetDWMagician] then", [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] says, eager and relieved. "Can you help me [satanists_recruit.GetDWReasonToJoin]?" [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] continues, eyes pleading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7008;"We might... If you offer yourself up to [satanists_recruiter.GetDWDevil], you will be granted powers [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has kept from us humans." Fingering the leather pouch in my pocket, I slowly nod. "Oh, and I think you'll enjoy it..." [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] said, with a knowing smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_A;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been mulling over [satanists_recruiter.GetPossPronoun] words. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] told Adam he would die if he ate of the forbidden fruit... [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] lie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_ALT;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been pondering what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] would think of me for venturing down this path, but [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] has already offered me more support than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] ever has. I have begun studying books on the occult and so far I'm finding the views preached at the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] to be narrow-minded, at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7010_A;I found some cryptic scrawlings written in blood on my bedroom door this morning. The guards say they haven't seen anyone enter during the night and I dare not ask my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] to decipher it. Yet, I think I understand... The pentagram... the mark of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7015;I've met an intriguing and hypnotically beautiful [satanists_inductor.GetManWoman] at court. Apparently, this [satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] is a foreign diplomat? I engaged [satanists_inductor.GetHerHim] in conversation for the first time today, and we spoke at length about [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural]. I was shocked when [satanists_inductor.GetSheHe] carefully pulled up [satanists_inductor.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing the mark of Lucifer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7016;The [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] smiles. "I'm pleased to find you not only a charming [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.GetFirstName], but also one capable of intellectual discourse. The brethren value the pursuit of knowledge, you see, in addition to more... earthly pursuits." [satanists_inductor.GetHerHisCap] smile turns into a predatory grin as [satanists_inductor.GetSheHe] continues: "We'll soon see exactly how committed you are...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7017_A;[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] escorts me to my bedchamber. I hesitate upon entering, finding it flooded with light, as candles form a circle around my bed. Several hooded figures surround the room, chanting in unison. "Fear not, [Root.GetSisterBrother]. Power and pleasure – these are the gifts of [satanists_inductor.GetDWDevil].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7018;When I wake up the cloaked figures are gone and [satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] is lying next to me, a smile tugging at the corner of [satanists_inductor.GetHerHis] mouth. "Welcome to [satanists_inductor.Society.GetName],  [Root.GetTitledFirstName]", [satanists_inductor.GetSheHe] says. I hold [satanists_inductor.GetHerHim] close, wondering how I will look back on this moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7019_A;I let go of [satanists_inductor.GetFirstName]'s hand and [satanists_inductor.GetHerHis] smile vanishes. "What are you doing?", the beautiful creature asks. "I'm sorry, [satanists_inductor.GetFirstName]. This is not my path." [satanists_inductor.GetSheHeCap] takes my hand again, but only kisses it gently before turning away. "Only the [satanists_inductor.GetDWDevil] knows. I will remember you, [Root.GetFirstName]." [satanists_inductor.GetSheHeCap] hesitates, before adding: "I think you're special.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7019_B;My eyes dart wildly around the ungodly scene. The [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] [satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] looks disappointed. My body finally unfreezes and I bolt for the door. "Brothers and sisters, follow [Root.GetHerHim]! [Root.GetFirstName], we can talk about this!" The voice echoes behind me, as I run away. What was I thinking, getting involved in the [Root.GetDWDarkMagic]?! As I flee, panic in my chest, I trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7019_C;My eyes dart wildly around the ungodly scene. The evil [satanists_inductor.GetSeductressSeducer] rolls [satanists_inductor.GetHerHis] eyes as I bolt for the door. "Brothers and sisters, see to it that [Root.GetSheHe] doesn't do anything stupid." I don't make it far before I stumble and fall to the floor, a spear sticking out of my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7020;[satanists_inductor.Society.GetNameCap] might not be as bad as I thought, I muse to myself. I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I decided to join them. And I wonder where that beautiful creature went off to. Some ungodly adventure, surely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7050;Though my last act of worship has been some time ago, I can still sense an inhuman touch upon my soul whenever I think about what I did. I have become a changed [Root.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7051;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late. Now the dark tendrils of [Root.GetDWDevil]'s magic has invaded my mind, sapping my energy and resolve. I am haunted by anxious thoughts and sleep eludes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7052;I can feel it, it is inside of me! The mesmerizing voice, the sweet touch of my dark saviour! [Root.GetDWDevil]'s gift, the beautiful magic, is flowing freely through my veins. The sensation is dizzying, radiant, breathtaking. Nothing in the world can stop me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7053;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late. The dark tendrils of [Root.GetDWDevil]'s magic has invaded my mouth and twisted around my tongue. As I attempt to speak, my words fail me, making social interaction awkward and the casting of spells tedious and draining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7054;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late. What was first the lightest of limps has now turned into a hideous deformity. When I rub my sore, twisted ankles, I can feel the darkness pulsing just under my skin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7055;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late. Little by little, my spine has curved itself forward, pushing my head down towards the ground. It is as if the dark magic has twisted me away from the heavens so that I am always facing [Root.GetDWDevil].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7056;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late. At first, I thought the lines and blotches on my face were a temporary consequence of too many nightly adventures and too little sleep. Now I barely recognize myself in the mirror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7057;The corruption crept up on me so slowly - I did not realize what was happening to me before it was too late.

EVTDESC_MNM_7057_NEW;The use of dark magic has corrupted me! The dark tendrils of [Root.GetDWDevil]'s magic has invaded my body, eroding mind and muscle alike. It is obvious that [Root.GetDWDevil] is keeping me alive, but at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However as soon as I step inside the doors a [desecration_holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] throws [desecration_holder.GetHerHim]self at our feet begging us in the name of [desecration_holder.Religion.GetHighGodName] to show mercy and swears to not utter a word of our presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7116_POOR;Navigating our way through the small [desecration_holder.GetHouseOfWorship] I and my companions have entered the small room that goes for the inner sanctum. The room contains the sparsest possible honorings to [desecration_holder.Religion.GetHighGodName] and a scant few decorative idols and relics. The state of this place shows clearly the superiority of our cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7116_RICH;Making our way through the [desecration_holder.GetHouseOfWorship] I and my companions enter the inner sanctum with its relics and religious idols.

EVTDESC_MNM_7116_RICHER;Having penetrated the defenses of the impressive [desecration_holder.GetHouseOfWorship] I and my companions have entered the inner sanctum and are preparing for the desecration ritual.

EVTDESC_MNM_7123_DEAD;The truth puts a greater strain on some than others, and as [dw_induction_target.GetTitledFirstName] professed [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] newfound allegiance between shattered screams, our true lord saw fit to grant [dw_induction_target.GetHerHim] the sweet release of death at the height of my dark ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7123_NOT_WOUNDED;At first [dw_induction_target.GetTitledFirstName] resisted fiercely, but it slowly dawned on [dw_induction_target.GetHerHim] that no god would bother to answer [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] prayers.\nCome morning I was exhausted, but [dw_induction_target.GetFirstName] more than willingly swore allegiance to [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] true master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7123_WOUNDED;The cost of knowledge is great, and [dw_induction_target.GetFirstName] is not the first to have suffered this much for it. At least they did not succumb, but rose to see it eye to eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7124_INSANE;Even when I held nothing back, [dw_induction_target.GetTitledFirstName] refused to let the name of [Root.GetDWDevil] pass [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] lips. [dw_induction_target.GetHerHisCap] mind was not as protected, and if [dw_induction_target.GetSheHe] ever speaks again, it will be nothing but mad ramblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7124_NOT_WOUNDED;Even when I held nothing back, [dw_induction_target.GetTitledFirstName] refused to let the name of [Root.GetDWDevil] pass [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] lips. If I had pushed [dw_induction_target.GetHerHim] any further, either [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] bones or [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] mind would have given in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7124_WOUNDED;Even when I held nothing back, [dw_induction_target.GetTitledFirstName] refused to let the name of [Root.GetDWDevil] pass [dw_induction_target.GetHerHis] lips. [dw_induction_target.GetHerHisCap] broken bones will be a reminder of what happens to those who stand in our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7507_OTHER;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] gladly accepted my proposal. 'I could never imagine a greater honor, [Root.GetSisterBrother],' [From.GetSheHe] she told me as we were about to begin the summoning. Kneeling on the floor and holding each other's hands, we began to chant the magic words. As the stranger entered, I squeezed [From.GetHerHis] fingers and departed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7507_SELF;I whispered the words of the summoning spell even though I wanted to shout them at the night sky! The greatest honor was about to be mine. As the final syllables passed through my lips, I shut my eyes and waited in silence, my heart pounding hard with excitement. A warm hand gently squeezed my shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7511_OTHER;Finally, [From.GetSheHe] is here! [unholy_mother.GetTitledFirstName] went into labor last night and early this morning, little [From.GetFirstName] was born. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems strong and healthy. Even though only time can reveal what powers [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetDWDemon] blood has granted [From.GetHerHim], I anticipate great things to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7511_SELF;Finally, [From.GetSheHe] is here! As I look down on the [From.GetFaceDescription], brilliant face of my little [From.GetSonDaughter], I truly feel that everything I had to do to bring this moment into existence was worth it. Only time will reveal what powers [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetDWDemon] blood has granted [From.GetHerHim], but I anticipate great things to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7801;The time has come to end my wedlock with [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]: if not before [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], then before [Root.GetDWDevil]! Secluding myself, I pray and chant within the confines of the symbols I prepared on the floor. Holding a lock of [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]'s hair in my hand, only a few more spoken lines are needed to complete the ritual...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7803;A terrifying scream echoes through the hallways, and when I reach the scene I find a group of my courtiers bending over the lifeless form of my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]. Signs of bodily harm aren't to be found, but the look of sheer terror engraved on [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHis] face is enough to raise the hairs on the back of my neck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7804;One moment my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName] is crossing the open from one building to the next, and the next a blindingly bright light and thunderous sound seemingly shatter the world. After myself and the other witnesses manage to recollect ourselves, we find the singed remains of my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife]'s body lifeless on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7805;Screams of panic and agony wake me from my sleep. When I reach my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]'s bedchambers and turn the red-hot doorknob, I find only a few charred bones remaining of my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife]'s body. Aside from the bed [dark_divorce_target.GetSheHe] lay in, the bedchambers were luckily completely untouched by the flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7806;As we walk the grounds a rather cheeky crow pecks at my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]'s eyes. One crow grows into many, and before long my guards are fighting a hopeless battle, trying to beat the creatures off of [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHim]. When at length [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHis] screams cease and the cloud of black wings lifts, my [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] is but a bloody heap on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7808;My [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName] has begun to speak in tongues and spew obscenities seemingly at random! The courtiers are beginning to believe [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHim] possessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7810;My [dark_divorce_target.GetHusbandWife] [dark_divorce_target.GetFirstName]'s deranged ramblings, cackling and screaming turn to a mad cackling laughter that grows louder as [dark_divorce_target.GetSheHe] emerges from [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHis] bedchambers into the open. With what seems like... glee? [dark_divorce_target.GetSheHeCap] looks at her audience and throws herself off the balcony, a dull thud putting an abrupt end to [dark_divorce_target.GetHerHis] crazed laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7815;As a [Root.GetSocietyRank] and a weaver of [Root.GetDWDarkMagic], I can summon a supernatural beast to be my companion. This familiar will be my eyes and ears, as well as imbue me with its powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7822;Finally, my devout servant has arrived. [devil_disciple.GetSocietyRank] [devil_disciple.GetBestName] is a most accomplished [devil_disciple.GetDWMagician] and well-versed in the hallowed secrets of [devil_disciple.GetDWDarkMagic]. With [devil_disciple.GetHerHim] at my side, I shall continue to carry out the work of the great [Root.GetDWDevil].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7826;No person lives a life entirely devoid of sin, and neither does [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]. I just have to find some traits of [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] character that I can build on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_arbitrary;My agents have revealed that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is not always equally just in his judgments. If [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] were to visit and judge some of my criminals, I could encourage [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to judge based on appearance and whim. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_cruel;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s courtiers have learned not to walk too closely by [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] at the top of the staircase. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] seems to quite enjoy them getting hurt. I'm sure [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] would like to see my torture chamber! I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_deceitful;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s court appears to be in a mild state of confusion. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] seems to have a penchant for telling minor lies and watching the confusion that ensues. I should invite [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] and show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how much more rewarding the bigger lies are. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_envious;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] apparently has problems coming to terms with [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] not having what [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] neighbor has. Perhaps I can convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] of how right [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] feelings are over a banquet. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_gluttonous;My agents have uncovered rumors that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] rather enjoys his feasts. Introducing [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to new, exotic flavors might fuel [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] appetite even further. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_greedy;Thorough investigation has revealed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] rather likes [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] gold. I wonder if [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] is a gambling [corrupt_priest_target.GetManWoman]? I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_lustful;My agents have proved their worth! It would appear that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] has a liking for the pleasures of the flesh. A night of debauchery could well turn [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] secret liking into a publicly-known love. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_proud;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] seems to quite enjoy flattery and praise. I could organize a celebration in [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] honor, affirming [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has reason to be haughty. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_slothful;It would seem that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is somewhat bothered by the hassles of ruling. I could show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how much more enjoyable it is to do nothing, instead. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_wroth;My agents met with several of [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s courtiers, who all spoke of barely-suppressed outbursts of anger on the part of their [corrupt_priest_target.GetLordLady]. I should speak with [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] and convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to henceforth let it all out, instead. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_arbitrary;With my calm support [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] began to visibly enjoy sentencing people based on, for instance, their appearance, or the first sentence of their defense. A grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] afterwards told me [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] far preferred this over the tedious process of listening to lengthy explanations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_bonus;It seems that liberating [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] virtue has had unforeseen effects... Having finally discovered what [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has missed out on for all these years, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] has sunk headlong into utter depravity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_cruel;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a lot of fun in the dungeons. The prisoners, not so much. Both [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] and I discovered a new side of [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that was quite... unsettling. Not that it detracted from his gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_deceitful;As we feasted, I eventually subtly turned the conversation to the small lies [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] uses for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] amusement. We discussed how [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe], by using [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] talent for lies, could reap far greater rewards than mere 'amusement'. Thoughtfully, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] agreed, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_envious;As we feasted I subtly directed the conversation towards [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s neighbor. Through carefully-dropped hints I convinced [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does indeed rightfully covet much that is owned by others. The reinforcing effect this had on [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] envy has already become very clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_gluttonous;The lavish feast to which I invited [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] have paid off, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already started to consume vast quantities of the delicacies I introduced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to. Before [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] made sure I understood how grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was for the experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_greedy;During our games of chance [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] struggled more and more to hide [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] fondness for the gold coins on the table. With some well-placed words I managed to make [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] come to terms with [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greed. Letting [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] win most of the games ensured [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left both thankful and in high spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_lustful;The raunchy nights of pleasure and debauchery I hosted at my court for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] seem to have truly freed [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] remaining inhibitions. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] is most thankful to me for showing [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] needs not be ashamed of pursuing pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_proud;Over the course of the celebrations [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s ego inflated like a bloated cow. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] has already become insufferable to be around, but at least [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was exceedingly grateful that I 'finally recognized [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greatness'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_slothful;Over the past few days [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I did almost every conceivable thing... except managing a court. I have never seen [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] happier, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seemed most excited to spend less time ruling and more time enjoying life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_wroth;I slipped some coins to a servant in return for him bumping into [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] in a hallway during [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] visit. Only a few words from me were needed to unleash [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s anger upon the servant. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] afterwards confessed to me how liberating it was to let out [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] anger, and was most grateful I helped [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to discover this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7834;Despite my best efforts, one misplaced word was all that was needed for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] to take offense from my suggestion. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] stormed out of the room indignantly, and what's far worse, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] outed my supposed 'wickedness' to everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_charitable;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] at times seems almost reluctant to give to others. With a good example [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could be acquainted with the joys of keeping wealth to yourself. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_chaste;A lingering touch here, slightly too long a glance there... [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] might not be entirely as chaste as [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] pretends to be. I have just the servant for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to meet. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_diligent;It's almost as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] works hard because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has been taught to, and not because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] believes [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] should. I should show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that it is alright not to be a slave to hard work. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_honest;Honesty has more than once gotten [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] into trouble. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] should learn how to avoid it by using little white lies. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_humble;At times, when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does not receive his due credit, my agents report it almost seems as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is about to speak up. I will show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how it feels to be recognized! I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_just;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] has allegedly voiced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] annoyance that being just is so time-consuming. Surely I can make [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] see how cutting a few corners could save [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] a lot of time. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_kind;Occasionally [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s smiles and gentle words seem rather forced. With some help I am sure [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could come to understand that one does not always need to be all smiles with everyone. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_patient;Regular sighs and long, annoyed pauses give away that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as patient as is widely thought. Keeping all that frustration pent up inside cannot be healthy. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_temperate;Some of [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s servants reportedly saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] sneak into the kitchen at night to enjoy some leftovers. If I could speak to [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] in private I am sure I could convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there is no need for secrecy on these matters. Perhaps [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] would like to visit my court? I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_charitable;Using a display of wealth, I managed to convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] that sometimes money is of better use in one's own pockets. Thoroughly enticed by the prospect, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most pleased someone had spoken so frankly to him on these matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_chaste;I saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s glances at the servant during our conversation. With a few encouraging words I got them to seclude themselves, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] returned a changed [corrupt_priest_target.GetManWoman]. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most pleased with my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_diligent;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] by example that one can achieve things without working hard. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] truly seemed to enjoy the time spent at my court, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already resolved to spend less time working hard when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] returns home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_honest;A simple demonstration of talking my way out of an embarrassing situation by using a small lie was enough to get [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] interested. With some explanation and reassurance that nobody would get hurt, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seems to have finally abandoned [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_humble;All that was needed was to insist on giving [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] the credit that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was due. After some half-hearted attempts at avoiding it, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally accepted the praise, and seems to have gotten a taste for recognition now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_just;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] how quickly I judged some of the more bothersome criminals based on my intuition rather than a detailed examination of the facts. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most impressed, and has already started following my example!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_kind;The servant I had bribed continued his insolence for hours, before [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s kindness finally broke. We had a good long discussion afterwards, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally understood that some people are simply not deserving of kindness. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_patient;As I heard [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] sigh in frustration at the servant's incompetence, I gave the lad a piece of my mind. Before long, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s patience ended and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] joined me in a display of our anger. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] was incredibly grateful for the release, and seems to have done away with patience since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_temperate;Having ensured that I caught [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] eating leftovers in the kitchen after our banquet, I managed to soothe [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] worries and convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there was no reason to continue to pretend to have a small appetite. Our next banquet was far more enjoyable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7839;[Root.GetDWDevil]'s favors, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nWe believe it would please [Root.GetDWDevil] greatly should [corrupt_priest_mission_target.GetTitledFirstName] fall into depravity. See to it, and you will be greatly rewarded.\n\n[Root.GetDWExpression]\nSigned, [grand_enchanter.GetSocietyRank] [grand_enchanter.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7841;In the middle of the night, I seclude myself in the room I have meticulously prepared for tonight's [Root.GetDWDarkMagic]. With every step of the ritual completed, the air in the room grows more and more oppressing, until finally I sense I am about to unleash a being of terrible power upon my unsuspecting foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7843;The ritual was a resounding success! [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have taken quite a liking to me, and is now far more amenable to my suggestions. The unfortunate side effect is that [possess_courtier_target.GetSheHe] has become quite obviously... insane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7844;Not everything has gone according to plan. Although something quite clearly seems to have taken up residence within [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName], whatever it is does not seem to be inclined to make [possess_courtier_target.GetFirstName] more loyal towards you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7845;The ritual has failed completely. Whether [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s mind proved too strong, or due to some other reason, the entity did not manage to take a hold of [possess_courtier_target.GetHerHim]. [possess_courtier_target.GetFirstName]'s mind has completely shattered in the process, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7847;Despite [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s frequent bouts of madness, [possess_courtier_target.GetSheHe] has indeed been loyal so far. Which is why it comes as such a surprise to hear [possess_courtier_target.GetHerHis] characteristic cackling laughter behind you as cold steel sinks into your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_A;Night has fallen as I contemplate my latest ritual – there has to be more efficient ways of washing blood off one's clothes...?\n'You must be the [Root.GetDWDemon]', a voice sounds behind me. I spin, only to find a sinister young woman, casually raising a wooden stake. Then she shrugs. 'I can't let evil like you just walk around'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_A_again;As I retire to my quarters for the night, I am startled by a shadow, suddenly moving. 'It's been a while', a bright voice muses as a woman steps into the light, weapon raised. 'How did you get into my [Root.GetCapitalHolding]?', I demand to know, but my voice betrays my brave act. 'Your guards are sleeping, my [Root.GetLordLady]... Let's finish this'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_B;After having snuck out for a late walk with my pet familiar, I make my way back through the gates of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]. Suddenly, shadows surround me and I'm shoved into a wall. A group of angry villagers, their expressions dark in the light of their torches, has gathered around me. Someone yells: 'burn [Root.GetHerHim]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_B_again;I am moving quietly through the gates into the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] tonight, grateful for my disguise. Specific rituals sometimes require me to blend in amongst the common folk. It's become almost second nature – my [GetDWPartyClothes] would be quite the giveaway!\n'There [Root.GetSheHe] is!' someone yells. 'BURN [Root.GetHerHim]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_C;Having just performed a ritual requiring the full moon, it's past midnight when I sneak back into my quarters. Satisfied, I begin washing the blood off my hands. Behind me, someone clears their throat. 'Not so fast, you evil [Root.GetDWDemon]'. I feel the tip of a sword in my back. Another voice mutters: 'Just kill it, brother'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_C_again;In honor of [GetDWRandomDemon], I've just finished a new blood ward on my wall. The flickering candlelight makes the intricate pattern glisten, and I back away to admire my art. Suddenly, two shadows grow on the wall, looming over me... The tallest one says, nonchalantly: 'I told you we'd get another shot, brother'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_D;In the middle of one of our more carnal rituals, my fellow [Root.GetSocietyRank] suddenly gasps in surprise: 'Did you invite someone else?' Before I have time to reply, a torch is thrown to the floor, sparks singeing my skin. 'We've become [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s madmen, all of us', a darkly clad figure says. 'Die, you demon!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_D_again;I still have nightmares about the mysterious demon hunter I once encountered. These days, while I haven't been covering my tracks, the stench of my foul deeds travels further than ever before... Staring at the ceiling in my room, the moonlight suddenly goes out. Leaning over me is a man, weapon raised. 'We meet again'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_E;I'm not sure what my steward was thinking, letting in a group of holy knights to our [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. They know. Everyone knows! What I am, what I can do... When night falls, I'm not surprised to find myself backed into a dark alley, surrounded by them. 'All [GetDWDemons] must die...!', they cry, riling each other up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_E_again;Out surveying my lands, accompanied by a small entourage of servants, I notice a huge cloud of dust being stirred up on the road up ahead... My servants begin to shout and scramble about, as we see a group of knights charging at us – their banner, clearly that of the demon hunting cohort I barely escaped before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_F;The screeching of men and clanging of swords outside my room wakes me from my sleep! They break down the door and barge into my room and slowly approach my bed. One says that I am "Possessed" and another that I "Consort with [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]". Some still seem uneasy over what they are about to do but their leader silences them as they put a bag over my head and drag me away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20000;My [satanic_orgiast.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [satanic_orgiast.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber], was passing by and decided to pay me a surprise visit! [satanic_orgiast.GetSubjectPronounCap] is in a lewd mood and thought we might stage an impromptu orgy in honor of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20000_COURT;My [GetFromRelation] and [satanic_orgiast.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [satanic_orgiast.GetFirstName], is feeling lascivious and just suggested that we might stage an impromptu orgy together – in honor of the Great Serpent, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20004;Where am I?! Oh yes... the orgy – three days of wicked debaucheries conducted by a Priapic dwarf from Hell. The drugs, the copulation, the succubus with the hypnotic flute... the ritual murder. Was it real? All I know is that [satanic_orgiast.GetFirstName] sure knows how to throw a party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20004_ODD_SEX;My memories of the last few days are dreamlike. There was lots of smoke, a cackling old crone and a nubile young woman with a long tail that could do all kinds of things... Oh, and there was a loud midget ordering me and [satanic_orgiast.GetFirstName] into various interesting positions. I never realized I liked [satanic_orgiast.GetMenWomen] that way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20004_SEX;Having indulged in at least four different kinds of exotic drugs, the last three days are a fiery haze in my mind. There was a woman with a forked tongue, a one-eyed dwarf and many other wonderful freaks – some of them might even have been real! Mmmm, and the tricks [satanic_orgiast.GetFirstName] and I taught each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20012;After a lengthy discussion about the logistics of an upcoming ritual, my [satanic_reveler.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [satanic_reveler.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber] stood up abruptly, a depraved grin splitting [satanic_reveler.GetPossPronoun] face: 'Well, I'm bored. Let's head down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] and have some fun with the peasants!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20012_COURT;My [GetFromRelation] and fellow [satanic_reveler.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] and I had been discussing a small devotion to [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] when [satanic_reveler.GetSubjectPronoun] suddenly stood up, stretched and said: 'I'm in the mood for mayhem! Let's dress up and head down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20012_PARANOID;After discussing the details of an upcoming ritual, my [satanic_reveler.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [satanic_reveler.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber] stood up abruptly, a depraved grin splitting [satanic_reveler.GetPossPronoun] face: 'Well, I'm bored. Let's head down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] and have some fun!' There it was – the expected attempt on my life... Good thing I've already subverted most of [satanic_reveler.GetPossPronoun] retainers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20014;Wearing nondescript common clothes, [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] and I are slowly making our way to town in amicable silence. As we pass by a neatly kept garden in front of a cozy-looking house, I am suddenly overcome with hatred and revulsion. This family is clearly favored by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20014_BACCHANALIS;I meet [satanic_reveler.GetTitledFirstName] on my way to the meeting. We walk together in the sacred garden, under the cover of the night, attracted by the maddening rhythm of the drums and cymbals of our brethren. Many have already begun the ritual when we arrive, dancing incessantly around the fires, filled with the God's essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20014_NOMAD;[satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] and I are riding down to the camp at a lazy trot. As we pass by some children playing in front of an impressive yurt I am suddenly overcome with hatred and revulsion. This family is clearly favored by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20015;The father of the family died last. Ah, but the marvels he got to see first! [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] carved the wife's face off and pranced around wearing it as a mask, taunting and kissing the man while I boiled baby fat to make a flying potion. Finally, we constructed an idol of [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] from the dismembered bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20015_B;The frenzy takes hold of us as the god's brew courses through our veins, filling us with primal strength and divine intent. We fret and scream at the moon, circling around the wailing victims rounded around the fire. I leap forward growling and sink my teeth in the flesh of a young man, tearing him apart and desecrating his corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20015_DEATH;The father broke free just as we were putting out the eyes of the oldest girl. Somehow, the man got hold of a huge pestle and managed to brain [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] before I could cut him down! [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] must have been displeased with [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName], but I honored [satanic_reveler.GetObjectPronoun] by using parts of [satanic_reveler.GetObjectPronoun] for the idol of [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] I built with the bodies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20015_DEATH_B;The frenzy takes hold of us as the god's brew courses through our veins, filling us with primal strength and divine intent. We fret and scream at the moon, circling around the wailing victims rounded around the fire. Yet, in the end it's [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] that I leap on, consumed by Bacchus' madness, tearing and clawing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20016;Predictably, the local populace didn't appreciate the glorious monument of flesh that we left for them to find. Rumors are running rife and it won't take much for the whole of [Root.Location.GetName] to erupt into open rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20017;Predictably, the populace of [Root.Location.GetName] didn't appreciate the glorious monument of tortured flesh that we left for them to find. In fact, they were so riled up that they've taken up arms against their rightful rulers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20021;The tavern was packed when we arrived. [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] distracted the tavern keeper while I dosed the barrels with '[Root.GetDWDrug]'. An hour later, the mood was getting festive. Two hours later and the crowd had descended into utter madness. [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] knows what they saw while we were offering up the staff to [Root.GetDWRandomDemon].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20021_B;Our frenetic dance quickly turns into a violent orgy. Wails of men and beasts overlap in a sinister cacophony as the grotesque shadows of our jumbled limbs quiver, grasping for the crackling fires. When I finally regain consciousness after dawn, soiled and exhausted, I only have broken memories of the terrible delights I experienced during the Bacchanal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20021_RIVALRY;The tavern was packed when we arrived. [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] distracted the tavern keeper while I dosed the barrels with '[Root.GetDWDrug]'. An hour later, the mood was getting festive. That's when [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] decided to play a prank on me, locking me into a room with three burly warriors who were starting to rave and hallucinate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20021_RIVALRY_B;Our frenetic dance quickly turns into a violent orgy. Wails of men and beasts overlap in a sinister cacophony as the grotesque shadows of our jumbled limbs quiver, grasping for the crackling fires. Then, just as I am finally feeling the gods fill me with his ecstatic presence, I feel somebody yelling at me and something hitting my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20022;When I came to, [satanic_reveler.GetFirstName] was long gone... so much for fellowship. Uuuh, I can't think straight. Where am I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20032;For some time now, my [demon_summoner.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [demon_summoner.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber] and I have been researching the proper ritual for invoking a certain [Root.GetDWDemonTerm]. A few weeks back, our kin managed to procure an ancient clay tablet with the missing incantation. We stand ready now to attain powers undreamed of by mortal [Root.GetMenWomen]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20032_COURT;For some time now, my dear [GetFromRelation] and [demon_summoner.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], [demon_summoner.GetFirstName] and I have been researching the proper ritual for invoking a certain [Root.GetDWDemonTerm]. A few weeks back, our brethren managed to procure an ancient clay tablet with the missing incantation. We stand ready to attain powers undreamed of by mortal [Root.GetMenWomen]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20034;Our coven surrounds the summoning circle, the correct symbols drawn, the fatty candles burning a sickly green. [demon_summoner.GetFirstName] intones the final invocation just as I offer up the sacrifice... Distracted by the spurting blood, at first I don't notice the man standing in the circle like he was there all along. Looking straight at me with a smirk, he says 'Bravely done, child! You have no understanding of the forces you are meddling with, but I did find your sacrifice pleasing. Quid pro quo – name your desire, [Root.GetBoyGirl]...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20035;While enjoying a quiet snack in my study, I suddenly felt an irresistible urge to jump out the window. Just like in a dream, I walked over and did it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20043;[dw_buddy.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber], my [dw_buddy.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType], wants me to join [dw_buddy.GetObjectPronoun] for a lark over in [target_province.GetName]. There is a certain [target_province.Religion.GetPriestTitle] and would-be witch hunter who has been a thorn in our side for some time. It is time to teach the arrogant fool a lesson in manners...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20043_COURT;My [GetFromFromRelation], [dw_buddy.GetFirstName], wants me to join [dw_buddy.GetObjectPronoun] for a lark over in [target_province.GetName]. There is a turbulent [target_province.Religion.GetPriestTitle] there who has been antagonizing [Root.Society.GetName] for quite some time. It is time to teach the arrogant fool a lesson in manners...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20045;We found the zealous [target_province.Religion.GetPriestTitle] in [target_province.GetName], praying in seclusion. [dw_buddy.GetFirstName] snuck up from behind and gave the fool a hard kick in the head. As I gave a devotion to [Root.GetDWRandomDemon], [dw_buddy.GetFirstName] proceeded to relieve [dw_buddy.GetReflexivePronoun] on the comatose preacher. Then the butchery commenced...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20048;Masquerading as the dead [target_province.Religion.GetPriestTitle] and attendant, we have been riding between every [Root.GetDWSettlement] and market in [target_province.GetName], preaching the 'Word of [target_province.Religion.GetHighGodName]' to the masses. Eager ears are picking up on our revolutionary message – the path to salvation requires self-indulgence and the rejection of so called authorities – especially the clergy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20049;[dw_buddy.GetFirstName] and I staged a lavish feast in the abode of the dead [target_province.Religion.GetPriestTitle], taking care to only invite dignitaries who weren't well acquainted. The guests were shocked at the dancers, the half-naked musicians and the heady smoke from exotic 'incense', but when we brought in the prostitutes half the guests stood up and left – the other half were delighted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20052;My compatriot in the recent escapade to [target_province.GetName], [dw_buddy.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], seems to have played a prank on me. [dw_buddy.GetSubjectPronounCap] appears to have told [local_ruler.GetTitledName] that I was behind the rabble rousing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20053;I just learned that my neighbor, [From.GetTitledName], has been stirring up the rabble in [target_province.GetName] with heretical nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20061;My nights are plagued by terrible nightmares featuring the vile [dw_buddy.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber], my rival [dw_buddy.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType]. [dw_buddy.GetSubjectPronounCap] howls and roars at me to the tune of infernal bagpipes while [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] looks on, bellowing with laughter. I am sure that [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is sending me these dreams for a reason... I must prove myself worthy or be discarded as a weakling – such is the way of [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20063;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], declined my offer to lay our differences aside and have some harmless fun together. The [GetRootFromInsult] must have sensed my true intentions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20064;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] arrived for our meeting, my servants threw a sack over [From.GetObjectPronoun] and beat the [GetRootFromInsult] into submission. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is now snugly stowed into a brazen bull that I had built especially for this occasion. Surrounding the bull are some crucified scum from my dungeon, drenched in oil.\n\nIt took some work to find three genuinely insane musicians, but as they start up their demented tune and the fires are lit underneath the bull, I lean back and realize it was all worth it. As soon as the first bellows start issuing forth from the bull, I order the human candles lit. I close my eyes and hum along with the infernal choir, my nightmares conquered once and for all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20065;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone suddenly threw a sack over me and I was mercilessly pummeled until I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was hogtied and lying on the cold ground. My blindfold was roughly pulled off and I beheld a great brazen bull with firewood stacked underneath! Hooded characters forced me inside, with my mouth near a funnel of some kind. The hatch closed and soon I could hear demented music and chanting as the bull started to heat up. Please, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forgive me. Save my soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20067;As [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone threw a sack over me and knocked me about a bit. Playing along with the charade, I was whisked away and switched for another bundled up victim...\n\nLater, I watched from the shadows as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] staged a demented musical ritual. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] had brought an actual brazen bull, just like the one built for the Tyrant of Akragas in ancient times. Believing me to be inside, the [GetRootFromFromInsult] ordered the flames lit. With the bull heating up, oil was poured over a bunch of crucified prisoners and set on fire – human candles screaming in accompaniment to the bellows issuing forth from the bull. The fool never realized [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] was cooking [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] own [GetFromFromVsFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20068;What is this box doing on my desk? Let's look inside... it's a bright white skull, gleaming like a jewel. Hmm, and there's a note: 'I really enjoyed the prank you tried to pull on me the other night! Good thing I wasn't actually in that bull... but, have you seen your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] lately? – Your old friend, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20070;I have put the word out among my brethren in [Root.Society.GetName]. When an opportunity presents itself, the brothers and sisters in [abduction_target.Capital.GetName] will attempt to snatch [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and bring [abduction_target.GetObjectPronoun] to me in chains...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20081;My fellows in [Root.Society.GetName] have informed me that [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] plans to travel the realm incognito for a lark, mingling with the common folk. [abduction_target.GetSubjectPronounCap] will only be protected by two loyal friends during this little adventure – a great opportunity to have [abduction_target.GetObjectPronoun] abducted, if I so wished...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20081_CHILD;My fellows in [Root.Society.GetName] have managed to insert themselves among the servants of [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and stand ready to snatch the child at my command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20082_BABY;Someone is picking me up. I don't know this strange lady, and where is she taking me..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20082_CHILD;I had been playing with my friends for hours in the field when one of my attendants suddenly made a strange noise and keeled over. All hell broke loose as the guards and servants started fighting each other. A veteran soldier picked me up and started running back towards home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20083;My competent brethren in [Root.Society.GetName] managed to snatch [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] from [abduction_target.GetPossPronoun] guards and bring [abduction_target.GetObjectPronoun] to me in a sack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20084;My incompetent brethren in [Root.Society.GetName] failed to capture [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], though apparently they slew a guard and a servant in the attempt. Even worse, it appears that [abduction_target.GetFirstName] has started to suspect my involvement in the ambush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20101;There is no point trying to abduct [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstName] anymore, considering [abduction_target.GetSubjectPronoun] is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20102;[abduction_target.GetTitledFirstName] has ended up in prison, so there is no point trying to abduct [abduction_target.GetObjectPronoun] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20103;My brethren are not having much luck in their attempts to abduct [abduction_target.GetTitledFirstName]. Perhaps [Root.Society.GetName] are not influential enough to pull it off... Should I call it off?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20104;[abduction_target.GetTitledFirstName] has joined [Root.Society.GetName], so the brethren will no longer assist with [abduction_target.GetPossPronoun] abduction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_MNM_6993;I am not sure what has happened, but it has been a while since I've had any contact with [satanists_inductor.GetBestName]. It's disappointing, as I was sort of curious to see where our meetings were going... As I retire tonight, I feel convinced that our time together has somehow ended prematurely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_MNM_6993;It seems that even [satanists_inductor.GetBestName] can not reach me here in the confines of my cell. It's disappointing, as I was sort of curious to see where our meetings were going... As I attempt to get conformable in my new home I hope that when I am finally free I will see [satanists_inductor.GetHerHim] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_MNM_7112;It is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_7113_INTRIGUE;Knock them out from behind, they will make for a good sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_7113_MARTIAL;Seize them. Their blood will be a good sacrifice for [Root.GetDWDevil].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_7116_LEARNING;I will use the most holy in the rites of desecration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_7116_STEWARDSHIP;I will take the most expensive relics for myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_MNM_7117_VIOLENT;[Root.GetDWDevil] will be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_7119;All will be as [Root.GetDWDevil] desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_20082_BABY;The guards stopped the lady and brought me back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_20082_BABY_CAUGHT;These people look mean!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_20082_CHILD;...and keeps running, saving me from the traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNM_20082_CHILD_CAUGHT;...but he stumbles and falls, blow dart in his neck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_7001;If we do not ask questions, why did [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] make us curious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7001_B;Yet, it is rather intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7001_TT;You think it's a great discussion, fueled by alcohol or not.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7002;A sensible [satanists_recruit.GetManWoman], [satanists_recruit.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7002_TT;Continue your endeavor to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_7004;[satanists_recruit.GetSheHeCap] just needs one more little push.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_7005;You truly are a [satanists_recruiter.GetDWMagician] then? Can you [Root.GetDWReasonToJoin]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7005_TT;You ask §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! how you can begin your journey into this forbidden knowledge.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7006;If I can't turn [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim], no one can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7007;Patience, [satanists_recruit.GetSisterBrother]. We will speak more soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7007_TT;Write a letter to the coven about §Y[satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! induction. [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] §Y[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName]§! will handle it from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_7010;Of course, the bargain must be struck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7010_TT_1;You carve a pentagram into your arm, just like the one §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! showed you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVTOPTA_7010_TT_2;You cut your into your arm, a star surrounded by a circle, a symbol from your forbidden studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7014;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7014_TT;You will be on the look-out for "the messenger".\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7015;You're the messenger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7016;I... What do you need me to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7016_TT;§Y[satanists_inductor.GetTitledFirstName]§! offers no reply, instead taking you by the hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7017;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7017_TT;You partake in the ritual.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7018;I wish you had found me sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7018_TT;You become a member of [satanists_inductor.Society.GetName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7019;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] may punish me for it, but I'll remember you, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7019_TT;With some help from some of your most loyal guards §Y[satanists_inductor.Society.GetName]§! are discretely escorted away from your [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. "Lost travelers", you explain.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7020;My time is better spent far away from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7020_TT;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! will never worship [Root.GetDWDevil].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_7030;I accept. [grand_master.GetDWExpression];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_7001;We should not speak of this, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7001_TT;You would never question the authority of the almighty.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7002;I'm not sure [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] sentiments were sincere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7002_TT;You end your endeavor to recruit §Y[satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7003;What is this? I should call you a [satanists_recruiter.GetDWMagician]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7003_TT;You distance yourself from §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7004;It's been interesting, but I don't think [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] is ready for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7005;That is blasphemy, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName]! Leave my sight, before I call the guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7005_TT;You dismiss §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! offer and pretend it never happened.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7009;I can't believe I have been so gullible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7010;My immortal soul... What if I'm wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7010_TT;You order your servants to scrub the door clean, putting to rest any rumors this could stir up.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7017;I... I can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_7017_TT;You refuse this demonic ritual and try to escape!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MNM.7500.d;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] is bound to the altar [From.GetSheHe] appears to be mumbling prayers through [From.GetHerHis] gag. [From.GetSheHeCap] is sweating profusely, either due to the heat from the nearby pyres or from fear. [From.GetHerHisCap] holy vestments hang in tatters already, exposing [From.GetHerHis] chest. As the appointed hour draws near the chanting of your brethren builds to a crescendo until, finally, it is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.7502.a;Good sacrifices are in short supply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.7502.d;Bound and gagged, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is carried out of [From.GetHerHis] cell and dropped into the cauldron.

MNM.7505.d;[From.GetTitledFirstName] looks dazed as [From.GetSheHe] is dragged to the altar, but you can see dawning comprehension on [From.GetHerHis] face as [From.GetSheHe] is tied down.

Finally it is time, you swing your blade in an overhead arc which ends in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.7506.a;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNM.7506.d;You struggle against the bonds holding you to the altar, but there is no give in them.
