EVTDESC_LT_41000;The name 'West-Frisia' is a relic of times past, when the Frisians had presence in these lands. With them driven out and replaced by mighty Dutch, people have begun calling our realm 'Holland' instead, after the forested lands that form the center of the duchy. Perhaps it is time for us to embrace the change and use the new name in our records?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41001;The lands north of the Rhine delta were once ruled by a mighty Frisian kingdom, but with their presence a distant memory, 'Holland' has become the accepted term for their duchy. [From.GetBestName] has encouraged the transition, and will be using it in [From.GetHerHis] official records from this moment forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41002;After the failed revolt of [From.GetBestName] has finally been put down, [geldern_holder.GetTitledName] has brought forward a petition to your court to be installed as the ruler of Hamaland in the traitor's stead. [geldern_holder.GetSheHeCap], a claimant to Hamaland, seems a skilled and trustworthy fellow, and would no doubt be an asset to the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41003;After the failed rebellion of [FromFrom.GetBestName], a baron from Geldern has won the favor of [From.GetBestName], and [geldern_holder.GetSheHe] has been elevated to higher nobility. [geldern_holder.GetSheHeCap] now rules in the land formerly known as Chamavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41004;A representative of the newly expanded city of Breda is making demands of you. They want their status as the main population center of the county of Toxandria to be recognized. The Toxandri were a tribe as mighty as any other, but the people have been extinct for centuries. Perhaps it is time to do away with this relic of a name, and honor Breda instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41005;[From.GetBestName] has elected to refer to [From.GetHerHis] county of Toxandria by the name of its most populous city, Breda, from this moment onwards. The burghers are much pleased by the recognition and have held a feast in the honor of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41006;A representative of the newly expanded city of Kleve is making demands of you. They want their status as the main population center of the county of Hattuaria to be recognized. The Chattuarii were a tribe as mighty as any other, but the people have been extinct for centuries. Perhaps it is time to do away with this relic of a name, and honor Kleve instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_41007;[From.GetBestName] has elected to refer to [From.GetHerHis] county of Hattuaria by the name of its most populous city, Kleve, from this moment onwards. The burghers are much pleased by the recognition and have held a feast in the honor of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_LT_41003;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] brought this upon [FromFrom.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LT_41004;If it will appease the city, it could bring diplomatic benefits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_LT_41001;A newer, mightier culture rules Holland now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LT_41002;For that low baron? I think not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LT_41003;How short-sighted of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LT_41004;No, we must honor our legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LT_41005;A weed by any other name...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
