EVTTITLE20371;Scandalous Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF20200;The time has finally come for me to be officially recognized as [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. In order do this, I will need the support of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church, but convincing authoritative members will neither be easy nor cheap. To begin the preparations, I should find a priest willing to crown me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF20303;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI will be glad to attend your coronation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF20304;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI am afraid I have to decline your invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFA20201;[From.GetFullName] wishes me to crown [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. What do I wish to ask [From.GetHerHim] in return?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20202;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation. I eagerly await [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s instructions regarding date and manner of the ceremony in order to better prepare myself for this sacred duty.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20203;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] donates a small sum of money to the Holy Mother Church as a show of [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20204;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] donates a sizable sum of money to the church of [From.Capital.GetName] as a show of [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20205;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] donates a sizable sum of money to the [From.Religion.GetName] Church as a show of [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20206;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by allowing the Holy Mother Church to initiate one of [Root.GetHerHisCap] children to the blessed life of monastic seclusion.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20207;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by allowing one of [Root.GetHerHisCap] sons to do his part in the sacred war against the infidels by joining one of our Holy Orders.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20208;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by organizing a private feast in honor of an ardent servant of the Church such as I am.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20209;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by expanding the borders of the Bishopric of [From.Capital.GetName].\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20210;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by joining me as a pious member of the [From.Society.GetName].\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20211;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to legitimize your divine right to rule, as soon as you recognize that the Church is no servant to any King or Emperor, but instead watches over the salvation of the souls of all [christian.GetGroupName]s, regardless of their stature. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20212;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you donate what is due to the Church. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20213;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you officially proclaim that it is no business of the [Root.GetTitle] to appoint members of the clergy. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20214;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you prove your devotion to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith by waging war against a most impious ruler whose wickedness made worthy of excommunication from Our Holy Church. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20215;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you prove your devotion to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith by deposing the most abominable false Papacy whose existence threatens the very survival of Our Church. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20216;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI will gladly recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you return to the Holy See some Italian lands over which you are wrongly proclaiming ownership, a violation of the sacred agreement between Emperor Pepin and Pope Stephanus II.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20217;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI will gladly recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you prove your devotion to the [From.Religion.GetName] by donating land to one of the Holy Orders who so fervently defend Our Church against all the infidels and sinners who would wish it destroyed. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20218;It appears the Pope was not content with excommunicating me from the Church, he has now enlisted the help of [From.GetTitledFirstName] to unseat me from my very throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20219;The road forward is clear: I must depose the corrupted [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetHerHis] throne in order to earn my crown. Only once this war has been won will I be able to continue with the preparations for my anointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20220;With the wicked ruler having been dealt with, the Pope has finally accepted to crown me [Root.GetTitle]. It is time to sheathe our weapons and let the celebrations begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20221;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nBefore I can recognize your divine right to rule, you must deliver back under Papal control some Italian lands being currently withheld by a wicked ruler against Our wishes, a clear violation of the sacred agreement between Emperor Pepin and Pope Stephanus II.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20222;The [christian.GetGroupName] Pope has decided to call one of his lackeys to arms against me, in an attempt to reclaim some of the Italian lands currently under my control. [From.GetTitledName] has just declared war against me on the Pope's behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20223;The road forward is clear: I must press the Church's claim over [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and restore [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s lands to Papal rule if I wish to be crowned [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20224;I have successfully wrestled Papal lands from infidel control and delivered them back under the blessed authority of the Holy See. Such an act has certainly ensured me a place in Heaven, or at the very least the gratitude of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20225;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nYour request is frankly ludicrous. Emperor Constantine gave full control of the Western Empire to the Papacy when he decided to move his court to the Eastern Provinces. If you wish to have a crown, I urge you to openly submit to the Holy See.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20226;As such is the will of the Holy See, I decided to formally submit myself and my Empire to the sacred authority of the Universal Church. From now and forever more, His Holiness [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and His successors will have control over our lands, as it was intended by Emperor Constantine when he originally split the Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20230;The Holy See has seen fit to press its ancient claim over my lands, and, in [From.GetHerHis] wisdom, my liege has decided to grant him his request. As such, it appears I have now become a vassal of the Holy See.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20232;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has died: with [From.GetHerHim] gone I must find another priest to anoint me [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20233;With the unexpected death of the priest meant to officiate the ceremony, it looks like [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been forced to postpone [From.GetHerHis] Coronation indefinitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20235;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, but first, let us celebrate this joyous occasion with a lavish feast. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20236;I can scarcely believe my eyes: the private feast organized by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is nothing more than a depraved orgy. All sorts of vile and shameless acts are taking place within the holy walls of [FromFrom.Capital.GetName], under the lecherous gaze of my guest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20237;[Root.GetPapalOrgyIntro] The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] brushes [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] tongue over my neck, whispering an incoherent prayer as [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] beckons me towards the orgy pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20238;This feast has given me much to think about the nature of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. I scarcely believe any heavenly reward could match the delights that [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] has introduced me to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20239;When my guards come to recover me in the morning, I barely remember anything of what has happened last night. I am fairly certain to remember, amongst other things, seeing [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] crown me on top of a fountain of wine, while wearing nothing but [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] miter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20240;To the Excellent [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be honored to officiate [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific]'s coronation, provided that [Root.GetHerHisCap] [Root.GetHonorific] show [Root.GetHerHisCap] devotion by donating the [scoped_artifact.GetName] [Root.GetSheHe] holds back to the Church.\n\nEver [Root.GetHerHis] [Root.GetHonorific]'s servant\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20241;To [Root.GetTitledName],\nI shall be glad to recognize your divine right to rule, as soon as you donate the [scoped_artifact.GetName] back to the Church. \n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20300;Now that I have a distinguished member of the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy to officiate my coronation, I must decide how much I wish to spend on the ceremony leading up to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20301;My dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI wish to formally invite you to my court for a period of festivities leading up to my coronation.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20302;Distinguished [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI wish to formally invite you to my court for a period of festivities leading up to my coronation.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20305;Only a few more days remain before I am crowned [Root.GetTitle] before [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and all my subjects. My court is filling with distinguished guests, both vassals and foreign dignitaries come to bear witness to this fundamental moment of my reign. Such a lavish ceremony is a rare spectacle to behold even amongst royalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20306;Organizing such a monumental ceremony has given me the chance to meet the rulers of the realms neighboring [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Maintaining healthy relationships with my [christian.GetGroupName] peers is fundamental to ensure future peace and prosperity for my realm. [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] in particular seems like a [potential_friend.GetManWoman] I could trust...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20307;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has spared no expenses for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. As I was admiring the lavish sights offered by [From.GetHerHis] palace, I was approached by the [From.GetTitle] [From.GetHerselfHimself]. After having talked to [From.GetHerHim] for a while, I am starting to think we might have a lot in common...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20308;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has cheerfully accepted my offer of friendship. I was not wrong putting my trust in [From.GetHerHim], and now, thanks to this fortuitous meeting, we have both ensured a lasting peace between our two realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20309;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not seem to share my feelings and politely refused my offer of friendship. While [From.GetSheHe] was hardly rude or confrontational, it is unfortunate that we could not see eye to eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20310;Organizing such a great ceremony has given me the chance to know better some of my vassals. Maintaining healthy relationships with all my subjects is fundamental to ensure the future stability and prosperity of my realm. [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] in particular seems like a [potential_friend.GetManWoman] I could really trust...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20311;Meeting new rulers and exchanging ideas about politics and royal virtues has been an interesting consequence of this ceremony. Everybody has at least one anecdote to share with me about the proper way to rule a Kingdom. I wonder which is closer to the truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20312;During the evening, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has remarked on multiple occasions of how it is important for a new ruler to create stable diplomatic relationships with [From.GetHerHis] peers and subjects in order to ensure peace and prosperity for everyone. [From.GetHerHisCap] show of dialectics has been a revelation for all the guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20313;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has entertained [From.GetHerHis] guests during the evening with a remarkable show of knowledge in the matters of State. While tedious to a few of the guests, some of the ideas we all discussed about how to improve and solidify a realm's economy were quite inspirational.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20314;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName]'s presence for my upcoming coronation has lured an entire flock of scholars and theologians in my court. While most of them keep their distance from the nobility, I have had the chance to overhear a few of them discussing about the most intriguing, metaphysical subjects during the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20315;The night at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court took a strange turn when our host decided to call some of the clergymen and scholars at the nobles' table, engaging with them in a long discussion about theology. I did not expect this feast to turn into a lesson about [christian.GetGroupName]ity, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20316;With so many distinguished guests having traveled all the way to my court, the least I could do is entertain them while we all wait for the day of my coronation. This could also provide me with an opportunity to impress some of my more influential guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20317;Whatever doubts I might have had about my performance were completely unfounded: my speech about the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] to [Root.GetHerHis] subjects was poignant and extremely well received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20318;Despite my best efforts, my speech about the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] to [Root.GetHerHis] subjects was received a bit too coldly compared to my expectations. Perhaps I should have used less platitudes and talked about something more substantive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20319;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time decanting the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. [From.GetHerHisCap] speech was passionate and on point, enough to convince many of the people present that [From.GetSheHe] will be an extraordinary ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20320;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time decanting the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. Sadly, [From.GetHerHis] speech was stale and filled with platitudes, and not many believed in the conviction that [From.GetSheHe] proclaimed to have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20321;I can almost feel the weight of the crown over my head already, but it is far from burdensome: I feel reinvigorated by the prospect of finally becoming [Root.GetTitle]. Thinking about my new responsibilities as an anointed ruler fills me with trepidation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20322;With all this pomp and circumstance, all these lavish preparations, and with my coronation so close, I am finally starting to understand the weight and importance of my role as [Root.GetTitle]. People expect great things of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20323;Everybody is so kind and respectful to me, even a lot of important people that I only met a few days ago. This Coronation Ceremony is a lot more important than I had thought. It is really great to be a [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20324;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] approached me tonight to personally inform me of how satisfied [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is with the great month of festivity I have organized to accompany my coronation. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] wanted to be sure that I knew of how welcome [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] feels at my court, and that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] expects great things of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20325;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] approached [From.GetTitledFirstName] tonight to personally inform [From.GetHerHim] of how satisfied [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is of the great month of festivity [From.GetSheHe] has organized to accompany [From.GetHerHis] coronation. [coronation_priest.GetFirstName] wanted to be sure that [From.GetTitledFirstName], as well as everyone within earshot, knew of how welcome [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] feels at [From.GetHerHis] court, and that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] expects great things of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20326;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] took some time after dinner to take me aside and give me a long talk about what my new responsibilities will be after [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] crowns me Holy Roman Emperor. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] warned me that being the heir to Charlemagne, as well as the protector of all Christendom will be a colossal undertaking, and that I should always strive to do my best to live up to the charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20327;Late this evening, as the servants were clearing up our tables, [coronation_priest.GetTitledName] decided to talk to me about my new responsibilities after the coronation: as a [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle], I will be sworn to care for the secular needs of all my subjects as well as to stand against the tide of sin and heresy beseeching our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20328;I can only imagine what pressure [From.GetTitledFirstName] must be under, to be given the responsibility of an entire realm while so young must be overwhelming. Perhaps I should take some time aside before dinner and try to teach [From.GetHerHim] a few things about being a good [Root.GetTitle], and thus repay the kindness [From.GetSheHe] did me by inviting me to such a lavish celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20329;I was just preparing myself for dinner, when [From.GetTitledFirstName], one of my foreign guests, decided take me aside, offering to teach me a few things that a good [Root.GetTitle] should know in order to rule wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20330;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was happy to learn more about [From.GetHerHis] upcoming responsibilities as a [From.GetTitle] from me. I am sure that what I told [From.GetHerHim] tonight will be of great use to [From.GetHerHim] in the future, and it will make [From.GetHerHis] realm more prosperous as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20331;Perhaps [From.GetTitledFirstName] is too young to understand that I was only attempting to aid [From.GetHerHim]: [From.GetSheHe] did not listen to my words and dismissed [From.GetHerselfHimself] as soon as [From.GetSheHe] could. This sacred ceremony might well be just a big game for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20332;I was surprised tonight when [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] stated that the period of festivity I have organized is unfit for the severity of the holy charge I am about to receive. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] has concluded [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] scolding by remarking that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] has witnessed many impious acts and degenerate behavior during [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] visit that have left [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] shocked and repulsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20333;Many tonight were surprised when [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] stated that the period of festivity [From.GetTitledFirstName] has organized is unfit for the severity of the holy charge [From.GetSheHe] is about to take. [coronation_priest.GetSheHeCap] has concluded [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] scolding by remarking that [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] has witnessed many impious acts and degenerate behaviors during [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] visit that have left [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] shocked and repulsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20335;It was not enough to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was at [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s celebration: tonight, in the middle of dinner, my old rival decided to insult me in front of my host and many of the other guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20336;It was not enough to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] was at [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s celebration: tonight, in the middle of dinner, my old rival decided to insult me in front of my host and many of the other guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20337;A heated argument has sparked between [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName], two of my distinguished foreign guests. Whatever their reasons, this diplomatic incident could be a stain on the legitimacy of this ceremony if not properly handled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20338;Thanks to my diplomatic skills I was able to not only stop the argument between the two rival rulers from escalating, but to also mend their disagreements permanently. We talked long after the dinner was over and when the two of them retired to their rooms for the night they professed that they have found a new friend in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20339;Thanks to my diplomatic skills I was able to not only stop the argument between the two rival rulers from escalating, but to also mend their disagreements permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20340;Unfortunately, my attempt to help my two guests calm down were unsuccessful. In the end, I was forced to leave them to their bickering, lest I was dragged in the fight as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20341;Unfortunately, my attempt to help my two guests calm down were unsuccessful. Even worse, at the end of the dinner, I had somehow managed to convince both [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName] that I was as much an enemy to them as they were to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20342;There [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] goes again, scolding [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guests with another sermon. It has been days now since I have had to put up with [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] endless moralizing, I cannot really take anymore of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20343;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName]. While [From.GetSheHe] forced me to stop from further deriding the [coronation_priest.GetTitle], [From.GetSheHe] was also kind enough to recognize the validity of some of my complaints about [coronation_priest.GetFirstName]'s behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20344;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName], and predictably, the [From.GetTitle]-to-be decided to take the side of the [coronation_priest.GetTitle]. There is no doubt in my mind that [From.GetSheHe] did so only because [From.GetSheHe] does not wish to risk losing the officiant of [From.GetHerHis] coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20345;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with my argument with [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName], and surprisingly, the [From.GetTitle]-to-be took my side, going against the [coronation_priest.GetTitle] who is supposed to crown [From.GetHerHim] only a few days from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20346;This morning, a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his sword to my service. He is ready and eager to serve a [Root.GetTitle] as wise and renown as I am to his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20347;It was hard to notice at first, but, after spending a few days with him in my service, I have come to realize that [coronation_knight.GetFirstName]'s devotion to me goes well beyond the boundaries of loyalty between a knight and his [Root.GetTitle]. Tonight, I pressed the issue with him, only to have [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] kneel at my feet and profess his undying love for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20348;Giving into my lust for [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] may have been a poor choice, especially at this time: with the court so filled with guests for my impending coronation, somebody ended up spotting the two of us while we were consuming our illicit relationship in the gardens. Now, the entire palace is ablaze with vicious rumors about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20349;Rumors have reached me that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has fallen in love with a black knight who only arrived at her court a few days ago. Stories about her illicit escapades with this stranger of low birth put a notable stain on [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s reputation: why should she engage in such a vile behavior, especially when so close to her sacred coronation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20350;It has been a great idea allowing [coronation_knight.GetTitledFirstName] to join my court. He knows so much about fighting! He has told me all sorts of stories about the countless wars he has fought in, and he has even offered to teach me some of his tricks, if I can spare him some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20351;This morning, a curious visitor came to my court: a wandering scholar who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He claims that he has heard many tales of what a wise and virtuous ruler I am, and wishes to put his knowledge to my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20352;Everybody is praising [From.GetTitledFirstName], everybody is saying what a great [From.GetTitle] [From.GetSheHe] will make... If nothing else, this Coronation Ceremony has really made me realize how much I despise that [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to make a scene during tonight's feast. Perhaps inviting my old rival to my coronation might have been a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20354;In a surprising show of kindness, [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to listen to my grievances against [From.GetHerHim] and promised to improve [From.GetHerHis] behavior towards me in the future. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is not such a bad person after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20355;I am soon to become [Root.GetTitle], yet here I am, alone in my palace, with only a few servants to celebrate what is supposed to be one of the most important days of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20356;However justified my reasons were to organize a secluded ceremony for my coronation, rather than waste money and time on feasts and entertainment, my vassals are far from pleased. Not only do they perceive it as a sign of weakness, but they all seem to have taken their lack of invitation as a personal slight against them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20357;I have only heard of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s pending coronation after the news spread across the realm. It seems that the [From.GetTitle] has organized a very secluded ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation, granting invitations only to [From.GetHerHis] most inner circle of advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20358;After growing increasingly hostile in the past few days, tonight [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] officially stated [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] disappointment at my lack of hospitality, publicly berating me in front of my Council and servants for how poor and secluded this coronation is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20359;It came to me as no surprise that [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] was disappointed with the secluded ceremony my liege organized for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] probably hoped for a much more grandiose ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20360;What will wearing a crown change when nobody is even here to see me be anointed [Root.GetTitle]? Is my realm destined to be as hollow and forgettable as this ceremony is going to be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20361;Spending the days leading up to my coronation in seclusion has given me time to meditate about my duties as a [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetTitle]. Perhaps I have been too egoistical in the past, perhaps this ceremony is my chance to be a humbler, kinder ruler...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20362;As I spend my evenings alone, counting the days left before my coronation, I cannot shake the feeling that I would have been able to afford a more lavish ceremony if it were not for [lazy_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s mismanagement of the realm's finances...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20363;[From.GetTitledFirstName] accused me of mismanaging the realm's finances! [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that, if it were not for my poor handling of the realm's treasury we would have been able to organize a much more grandiose ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20364;My celebrations have been interrupted by a heated argument between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] about the nature of devotion. I should probably put a stop to this before things escalate further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20366;I kneel before [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] as a host of Electors and vassals surrounds us in complete silence. The Pope blesses me as he prepares himself to place the Imperial Crown upon my head and proclaim me [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of the [roman.GetName]s by grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], and protector of all [GetChristendomOrRandom].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20367;[coronation_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] kneels before [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] as [coronation_ruler.GetHerHis] host of Electors and vassals surrounds them in complete silence. The Pope blesses [coronation_ruler.GetHerHim] before placing the Imperial Crown upon [coronation_ruler.GetFirstName]'s head and proclaiming [coronation_ruler.GetHerHim] [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of the Romans by grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], and protector of all [GetChristendomOrRandom].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20368;[coronation_ruler.GetFullName] has been crowned [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] by [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName], thus legitimizing [coronation_ruler.GetHerHis] divine right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20369;With the ceremony finally concluded and every guest returned home, I can resume my duties as [Root.GetTitle]: now that I have officially received the blessing of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church, the legitimacy of my divine right to rule is beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20371;The Pope was baffled when I reached for the Imperial Crown in the middle of the ceremony and snatched away the golden circlet from his hands. Amongst the general amazement of the crowd of noblemen around us, I announced that from this day forward the Papacy would hold no longer any power over the Imperial throne, as it was the case for all Roman Emperors of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20376;The people of [Root.Capital.GetName] are growing more and more restless every year. A [Root.GetTitle] who has not been anointed by the Church will never be seen as legitimate in the eye of any good [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20377;Month after month, I receive news about another one of the Bishops of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] accusing me of wickedness during one of his sermons. For as long as I have not been officially crowned [Root.GetTitle], the clergy will take every opportunity to further undermine my rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20378;I cannot believe my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has still not managed to be officially crowned [From.GetTitle]. Not only is [From.GetHerHis] display of weakness a threat to realm peace: tales of [From.GetHerHis] incompetence will surely drag my name in the mud alongside [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20379;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] stormed my private study this evening, berating me for not having managed to legitimize my rule over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with a proper Coronation Ceremony yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20380;The nerve of [From.GetFirstName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] dared to deflect my just criticisms of [From.GetHerHis] misconduct by pointing out that I have also yet to prove my legitimacy as [Root.GetTitle] before God. Sometimes I truly cannot stand [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20381;After listening to my harsh words, [From.GetFirstName] assured me that [From.GetSheHe] understands perfectly the severity of our situation and has already put in motion [From.GetHerHis] plans to solve the issue as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20382;As I was berating [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] failings as [From.GetTitle], [From.GetSheHe] decided to drown my complaints in a kiss, and whispered to me that I should stop my bickering and join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] chambers instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20383;It seems my [GetFromRelation] was not in the mood tonight. My attempt to distract [From.GetHerHim] from the issue of my pending coronation did not end quite well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20384;My liege's rule has yet to be properly legitimized by the holy right of coronation. I must inform [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] current condition is becoming a hindrance to my work as Chancellor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20385;My Chancellor informed me today that my prolonged lack of legitimization in the eyes of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church is seriously damaging all diplomatic missions of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20386;I can no longer suffer to serve under a wicked [From.GetTitle] who has yet to have [From.GetHerHis] rule be legitimized by the blessing of the Church. It is time that I make my disapproval known beyond doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20387;In a brazen display of disrespect, [From.GetTitledFirstName] proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] would no longer serve as the Court Chaplain of a wicked [Root.GetTitle] whose rule is still yet to be legitimized by the blessing of the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20388;Some time has passed, but I still cannot come to terms with how modest and secluded my coronation has been. Is it worthy of an [Root.GetTitle] to have [Root.GetHerHis] divine right to rule be recognized in the most meager of fashions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20389;Though some time has now passed since my coronation, the good people of [Root.Capital.GetName] are still in a festive mood, glad to finally see their [Root.GetTitle]'s status be recognized by the Church. It would be nice to see my subjects continue to celebrate my rise to the throne, if it were not for the fact that they are also using this as an excuse to work less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20390;Word of the lavish period of celebration that surrounded my coronation has spread across the realm and beyond. My name will be forever associated with prestige and wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20391;The great celebrations that surrounded my coronation concluded a while ago, but the trade and wealth they have brought to [Root.Capital.GetName] are still lingering, an unexpected consequence of my generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20392;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s coronation. While I was forced by Fate to be crowned alone and in misery, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] flaunted [FromFrom.GetHerHis] munificence with all [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guests and put up a spectacle that will be remembered for years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20394;Now that I am [Root.GetTitle], tradition demands that I travel to [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName] and offer homage to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], the divinely-appointed ruler of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20395;I have just received news that [From.GetTitledFirstName] will not come to [Root.Capital.GetName] and pay homage to [From.GetHerHis] rightful liege, as is tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20396;I have been informed that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] and has requested an audience with me in order to pay me homage, as is tradition for a newly-appointed vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20397;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was courteous enough to accept my homage and offer [From.GetHerHis] blessing as well. Now that this nuisance has been dealt with, I am free to return to my lands and rule in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20398;I was shocked to learn that [From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to grant me an audience, especially after all the trouble I have gone through only to pay [From.GetHerHim] homage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20399;According to legend, nested within the Iron Crown of Lombardy rests one of the sacred nails used to crucify Our Lord. Yet, after wearing this crown on my head for years, I have yet to see any trace of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20401;[GetFromRelation]'s crown is amazing! [From.GetSheHeCap] says only the [From.GetTitle] can wear it, but I am [From.GetHerHis] [Root.GetSonDaughter], and is that not close enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20402;I was woken up this morning by disturbing news: a guard stormed in my bedchambers to warn me that my crown had been stolen. I was disconcerted to discover, only a few hours later, that my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was the culprit. The foolish child is prancing around the Imperial gardens wearing the holy crown of Charlemagne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20403;My [GetFromRelation] caught me! Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] was not too upset that I had taken [From.GetHerHis] crown. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] took me aside and told me a long story about the ancient Kings the crown belonged to before getting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20404;My [GetFromRelation] caught me! [From.GetSheHeCap] was really mad to discover that it was I who took [From.GetHerHis] crown. [From.GetSheHeCap] had me dragged back to my chambers and made me skip both lunch and dinner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20408;Since I have forsaken the [From.GetName] faith, I no longer need the Church's approval in order to be deemed worthy of my crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20409;The sudden conversion of [From.GetTitledFirstName] led to an abrupt stop of [From.GetHerHis] coronation ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20410;The way [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] knelt down and offered me [FromFrom.GetHerHis] loyalty one would easily forget that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] doesn't even believe in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] as I do. Still, it was a respectful gesture for an unbeliever such as [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to come pay me homage in the [Root.Religion.GetName] way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20411;As I kneel down to recite the words, I cannot stop myself from wondering why do I need to partake in this silly ritual when I am not even a [From.Religion.GetName].[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20412;I seem to have made a very positive impression on [From.GetTitledFirstName]. I am hopeful that, after this ceremony, we will be able to maintain a good and healthy relationship as any liege should with [Root.GetHerHis] vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFA20413;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not look too pleased by my response to [From.GetHerHis] oath. Hopefully my behavior did not irredeemably ruin our relationship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB20218;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has enlisted the help of [From.GetTitledFirstName] in order to depose my Anti-pope through the strength of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20219;The road forward is clear: I must mend the schism brewing within the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church by removing the Anti-pope that is currently challenging the authority of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. In order to do so, I must wage war against [From.GetTitledName]. Only once this war has been won will I be able to continue with the preparations for my anointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20220;With the false Pope forced to abandon his unholy quest for power, and with full dignity restored to the Church, the Pope has finally accepted to crown me [Root.GetTitle]. It is time to sheathe our weapons and let the celebrations begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20222;The Papal State has decided to press some of its ancient claims over Italy by enlisting the help of [From.GetTitledName]. If our armies are defeated in the coming war, we will all be forced to submit to the rule of the Supreme Pontiff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20224;I have successfully wrestled Papal lands from infidel control and delivered them back under the blessed authority of the Holy See. Now that this war is over, it is finally time for me to receive my crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20236;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] made good use of my money: the holy walls of the Vatican have been filled to the brim with wine and whores. Soon after the start of the celebration for my upcoming coronation, the crowd of lechers and drunks invited to the party are already debasing themselves in the most abominable acts imaginable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20237;[Root.GetPapalOrgyIntro] The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] holds me by the shoulders, leering me with a drunken smile, and offers me a private communion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20239;When my guards come to recover me in the morning, I barely remember anything of what has happened last night. I am fairly certain to remember, amongst other things, seeing [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] crown me on top of a fountain of wine, while wearing nothing but [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] Papal tiara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20300;Now that I have found a [Root.Religion.GetName] priest willing to crown me, I must decide how much I wish to spend on the ceremony leading up to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20305;The time of my coronation draws near: only a few more days before I am crowned [Root.GetTitle] before God and all my subjects. My court has been already filled with all the vassals of my realm who have come to bear witness to this fundamental moment of my reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20308;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has cheerfully accepted my offer for friendship. I was not wrong in putting my trust in [From.GetHerHim], and now, thanks to this fortuitous meeting, I have further guaranteed the stability of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20316;Having all the important grownups in my palace is great opportunity to show them that I am just as smart and wise as any [Root.GetTitle] no matter how old I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20317;When I started I was shaking a bit, but, after I finished listing all the responsibilities my tutor taught me about being a good [Root.GetTitle], all my guests applauded and congratulated me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20318;Just while I was in the middle of listing the duties of a good [Root.GetTitle] like my tutor taught me, somebody in the crowd coughed and I lost my concentration! After a few failed attempts at resuming my speech, I was too embarrassed to continue and left the room covering my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20319;The young [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time listing the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. It was quite surprising to see a child show already such wisdom, so much so that, after [From.GetHerHis] speech, many were convinced that, despite [From.GetHerHis] young age, [From.GetFirstName] might make a great [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20320;The young [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to call for the attention of all [From.GetHerHis] guests before tonight's dinner and spent a great deal of time listing the virtues of a good [From.GetTitle]. Unfortunately, the child was not up to the task and stopped midway through [From.GetHerHis] speech, rushing away, red with embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20335;I would be quite enjoying my visit at [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s court if it were not for [From.GetTitledFirstName] constant harassment. The [From.GetManWoman] is clearly jealous of my accomplishments as [Root.GetTitle], and cannot stop trying to besmirch my reputation, hoping it would make [From.GetHerHim] feel better about [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFB20338;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with the argument I was in. While at first I was doubtful [From.GetSheHe] could offer any help, [From.GetHerHis] intervention was enough not only to stop my rival's unjust accusations, but also to help clear any disagreements we might have had with each other permanently. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has proven [From.GetHerselfHimself] to be a true friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20339;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere with the argument I was in. While at first I was doubtful [From.GetSheHe] could offer any help, [From.GetHerHis] intervention was enough not only to stop my rival's unjust accusations, but also to help clear any disagreements we might have had with each other permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20340;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere in the argument I was in. While [From.GetHerHis] intentions were good, [From.GetHerHis] attempt to mend the disagreements I have with my rival was fruitless. This is no problem that can be fixed with a simple talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20341;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to interfere in the argument I was in. As if that was not embarrassing enough, I am now certain that [From.GetSheHe] favored my rival's reasons over mine, a clear breach of [From.GetHerHis] duty as host to be welcoming to all [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20346;This morning a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his loyalty to me and protect my honor from all offenders. He is ready and eager to defend the reputation of a [Root.GetTitle] whose virtue is as renown as mine to his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20352;Everybody is praising [From.GetTitledFirstName], everybody is saying what a great [From.GetTitle] [From.GetSheHe] will make... I cannot stand the sight of my old rival being showered with compliments. Being invited to [From.GetHerHis] moment of glory was an insult of its own, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to pick a fight with me during tonight's feast. For whatever reason, [From.GetSheHe] has come to the conclusion that I am an ungrateful hypocrite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20355;What sort of [Root.GetTitle] am I to become? I could not even manage to organize a proper coronation ceremony, during a time of peace. Here I am, wading through the mud of a military encampment, preparing to receive my crown in the most undignified of settings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20356;However justified my reasons were to organize a secluded ceremony during a war, my vassals are far from pleased. Not only do they perceive it as a sign of weakness, but they all seem to have taken their lack of invitation as a personal slight against them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20357;I have only heard of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s pending coronation after the news spread across the realm. It seems that the [From.GetTitle] has organized a very secluded ceremony for [From.GetHerHis] coronation, to be held in [From.GetHerHis] own military tent. Invitation was granted only to [From.GetHerHis] most trusted councilors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20358;Just as [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] is about to complain for the hundredth time about the poor locale my coronation is taking place in, one of the swines trotting around the main hall bumps into the Holy Father, slamming [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] headfirst into the mud. A dead silence falls upon the main hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20359;It came to me as no surprise that [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] was disappointed with the secluded ceremony my liege organized for [From.GetHerHis] coronation. The [coronation_priest.GetTitle] even refused to visit my ruler in person, claiming that it would have been too dangerous a travel for [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] to partake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20366;I kneel before [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] as host of vassals surrounds us in complete silence. The Pope blesses me before placing the Imperial Crown upon my head and proclaiming me [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of [coronation_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] by grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20367;[coronation_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] kneels before [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] as [coronation_ruler.GetHerHis] host of vassals surrounds them in complete silence.

EVTDESCHFB20370;With the ceremony finally concluded, [From.GetTitledFirstName] bid me farewell and dismissed me from [From.GetHerHis] court, alongside all [From.GetHerHis] other guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20371;The Pope was baffled when [coronation_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] reached for the Imperial Crown in the middle of the ceremony and snatched away the golden circlet from his hands.

EVTDESCHFB20392;I am still thinking about [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s coronation. While I am yet to be anointed [Root.GetTitle], [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is already flaunting [FromFrom.GetHerHis] crown with all of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s neighboring royalty after putting up a spectacle that will be remembered for years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20408;Since I have forsaken the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, I must petition the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church's approval in order to be deemed worthy of my crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20410;The child kneels down, reciting mechanically [FromFrom.GetHerHis] oath of vassalage. I had no idea [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was such a young [FromFrom.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFB20411;I kneel down to the child [From.GetTitle], peeking every once in a while to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] is still listening to my oath. I never realized that my liege was such a young [From.GetBoyGirl]...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFC20224;I have successfully wrestled Papal lands from infidel control and delivered them back under the blessed authority of the Holy See. His Holiness was so relieved by my victory that he decided to entrust me with the safekeeping of one of the most sacred relics of the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20300;Now that I have found a distinguished member of the Catholic clergy to officiate the rites, it is time to organize the ceremony itself. Unfortunately, the necessities imposed by the war I am waging will force me to have only a small gathering of my closest allies to witness this momentous occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20305;The time of my coronation draws near: only a few more days before I am crowned [Root.GetTitle] before God and all my subjects. It will be a long wait with very little to do, but I hope at least that this period of seclusion will give me time to ponder upon my future responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20346;This morning a curious visitor came to my court: he is a wandering knight who traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName] after hearing news of my upcoming coronation. He has proclaimed that he wishes to pledge his loyalty to me and protect me from any who would attempt to harm me. He is ready and eager to join the ranks of my bodyguards and shield my life with his.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20358;As if sending a Cardinal in [coronation_priest.GetHerHis] place was not enough of a slight from the Holy Father, the Papal envoy himself has proven to be a most insufferable man, constantly complaining about the lack of care he is receiving and recanting all the many dangers I am exposing him to by having this coronation held in the middle of a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20366;I kneel before [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] with all my reverently silent vassals surrounding us. The Pope gives me an encouraging smile as [coronation_priest.GetSheHe] blesses me and places the Imperial Crown upon my head. I feel my face turn red. He then proclaims me [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] of [coronation_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] by grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHFC20370;With the ceremony finally concluded, [From.GetTitledFirstName] bid me farewell and dismissed me from [From.GetHerHis] encampment, alongside all [From.GetHerHis] other guests. I still cannot believe that the coronation was not abruptly interrupted by an enemy raid... [From.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must really be protecting [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20371;I have received the most damning rumors about [coronation_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]'s Coronation Ceremony. According to most reports, the [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] to be threw [coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] out of [coronation_ruler.GetHerHis] palace's balcony, proclaimed [coronation_ruler.GetHerHim]self to be [coronation_ruler.GetTitle] by [coronation_ruler.GetHerHis] own will, and proceeded to reveal [coronation_ruler.GetHerHim]self as the Antichrist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20410;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] slowly kneels down with the help of one of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] servants. The old man recites [FromFrom.GetHerHis] oath of vassalage with a faint voice, stopping a few times to remember some of the words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHFC20411;I kneel down to the old [From.GetTitle], peeking every once in a while to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] has not passed out in the middle of my oath. I never realized my liege was such an old [From.GetManWoman]...[Root.GetHomageReaction];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF20351;You are welcome, [coronation_scholar.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20352;I must be quiet and endure it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20353;Well, I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20355;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20358;This is very rude of [coronation_priest.GetHerHim] to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20358_B;Pffh- I mean, do you require any assistance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20360;Why should I even care about ruling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20361;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20362;It is too late to point fingers now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20364;[coronation_priest.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20371;What is [coronation_ruler.GetSheHe] doing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20377;These accusation have no theological basis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20378;[From.GetSheHeCap] has enough troubling [From.GetHerHim] already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20379;Dear, allow me to at least explain the issue clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20382;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20386;Maybe I should give [From.GetHerHim] some more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20388;The Lord cares not for riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20389;Meh, let the rabble have their fun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20392;This is all incredibly unfair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20394;I owe [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20396;I do not have time to waste with the likes of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20399;I do not need to see it to know that it's there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20402;Give me back the crown immediately, [From.GetSonDaughter]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20410;You are no doubt the prettiest face in this court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20411_A;I am not sure about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF20411_B;There are still limits to our contract!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF20200;Any priest will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20201;I AM THE POPE! I WANT ALL OF THE STUFF!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20236;I will take just another bit of swan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20300;I will have a private ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20300_B;It is what it is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20326;I will work tirelessly to be a worthy successor to this great man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20327;Empty words and nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20347;Unacceptable. You are relieved of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20351;I do not deal with beggars and charlatans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20364;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20371;Disconcerting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20377;A generous donation to the Church will shut them up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20379;Rather than fighting, could we not do something more relaxing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20388;I deserved so much more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20389;Get back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20402;Eh, I will let the kid have [From.GetHerHis] fun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF20410;Is this how you present yourself to your [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF20200;Maybe this is not the right time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20364;I better not interfere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20377;I only need a few months more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20379;Just leave me alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF20410;We are glad for your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF20410;I am happy you came!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHF20208;Sounds fun, may I join as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
