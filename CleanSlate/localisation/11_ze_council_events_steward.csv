EVTOPTB_ZE_3008;Tear it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_3010;It's too much, remove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_3011;Hah! You must be joking, I have better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_3012;Maybe we could squeeze them for some more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_3013;I guess one cannot predict the weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
