EVTDESC_HFP_41004;A messenger approaches us with a letter from the Vatican, from the Vicar of Christ [From.GetHerselfHimself]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is asking us to prepare our men to fight against the heathens and infidels, to restore Christendom to the lost places of the world. \n\nThe Pope wants to send our faithful [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] men against [crusade_title.GetBaseName]. The region is held by [crusade_character.GetCrusadeReligionDescription] [crusade_character.GetTitledName], and it is time to return it to Christianity once more.\n\nThough the Pope wants to invade [crusade_title.GetBaseName], a pious [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] could convince everyone to focus on another objective that is of more value to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41009;In a grand announcement the Pope declares [crusade_title.GetCrusadeLaunchAnother]Crusade for [crusade_title.GetBaseName]. [Root.GetCrusadeLaunchFirstPart]\n\n[Root.GetCrusadeLaunchSecondPart]\n\n[From.Religion.GetHighGodName] will grant remission of sin to everyone partaking in the righteous war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41011;The announcement about the grand Crusade was sent to every [From.Religion.GetName] realm, but apparently to no avail. The Pope has been trying to gather up support for the Crusade for months, but now the Vatican has gone quiet, as the Vicar of Christ has given up on his Crusade.\n\nThe [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s seem more interested with infighting than fighting the heathens or infidels outside their own borders. The Crusade was officially canceled, as the Pope held a large announcement denouncing the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Lords and Ladies for their ineptitude in the matters of Faith. Now it is only a matter of time until [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] forsakes his faithless followers, and leaves them to be conquered by the sacrilegious infidels, blasphemers and heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41022;Dear [Root.GetTitledName]\nIt has come to my attention you have not yet put on the cross. I have decided that it is time for you to pay back the favor you owe me, and be part of this endeavor.\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41031;[pleased_courtier.GetFirstName] approaches me as I am on my way out, to tell me how happy [pleased_courtier.GetSheHe] was to hear I had pledged my men to the Crusade, and wish me luck in the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41032;I receive a letter from [pleased_participant.GetTitledName], with a well detailed approval of my decision to join the upcoming Crusade. Maybe this is a chance to get closer as we fight the the heathens together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41033;I receive a letter from the despicable [pleased_participant.GetTitledName]. As we are both going to participate in the upcoming Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName], [pleased_participant.GetSheHe] wants us to make amends and move on from our disagreements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41034;I have been unable to stop myself from being somewhat excited at the prospect of the driving away the infidels from [crusade_title.GetName], and restoring peace to those lands. I have not usually felt this inspired as a [Root.Religion.GetGroupName], but maybe I am changing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41035_1;Knowing I will be gone for a while, I decide to spend a day with the local sea creature while I still can. It comes up with some great battle plans I can use in the upcoming wars for [crusade_title.GetName]. I am blessed to have such a good friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41035_2;I drop by the local forest, to spend some hours with the beasts and fauna before I leave home. I end up having a fruitful discussion with, well, I am not entirely sure what it is, but the conversation was enlightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41041;[displeased_courtier.GetFirstName] explains to me in great detail exactly how disappointed [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe] is in my decision to leave the Crusade. After the long tirade [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe] finally leaves the room, and I get some time for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41042;I received a letter from the esteemed [displeased_participant.GetTitledName]. It seems [displeased_participant.GetSheHe] is displeased in my decision to revoke the pledge I made to the Crusade, and finds me somewhat untrustworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41043;One of my messengers brings me a letter from [displeased_participant.GetTitledName], where [displeased_participant.GetSheHe] declares me an unreliable swine and a traitor to all [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41045;Messengers are sent to every corner of the world, as the Pope furiously excommunicates the despicable and vile [unpledging_actor.GetTitledName]. [unpledging_actor.GetSheHeCap] is expelled from the faith for forsaking [unpledging_actor.GetHerHis] fellow [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s in their righteous war for [crusade_title.GetName].\n\n[unpledging_actor.GetTitledName] should not be helped, cared for nor forgiven. A traitor to the faith as well as to the cause, the only thing [unpledging_actor.GetSheHe] deserves is to be justifiably overthrown. A true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] would not betray [unpledging_actor.GetHerHis] allies to fight the heathens alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41051;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI noticed you still have not pledged to the Cross. As a faithful [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] ruler, I hope and pray that you will reconsider your actions, and join in the righteous war for [crusade_title.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41054;After the long fought battle for [new_crusader_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it has finally been restored to the faith. [new_crusader_king.GetDynName] has stepped up to the throne as the beneficiary of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], becoming the [new_crusader_king.GetKingQueen] of the Crusader State. Surely it will be hard to continue fighting at the fringe of Christendom, but everyone can agree [new_crusader_king.GetTitledFirstName] is the right person for the task.\n\nThe Pope requests that the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] world support this new Kingdom as best they can, and not let it once more fall to the infidels and heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41057;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI know we have had our differences, but it pleases me to hear you have decided to join our rightful cause. I have made the preparations to recant your excommunication from the church.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41061;The victories against the infidels were hard-fought, but things have finally settled down and the titles I fought for were given to [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetDynName]. It will surely be difficult to be a part of the new Kingdom, but I wish [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetHerHim] luck in [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetHerHis] future endeavors.\n\nI look back one last time as my men and I leave [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. I wonder what life would have been like if it had been me staying here, rather than [beneficiary_check_crusader_beneficiary.GetDynName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41075;Greetings, [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI was informed the heathen Pope have declared a will to bring a Crusade to your doorsteps. As a fellow [From.Religion.GetName], I pledge to stand by your side when the unfaithful come to take your lands.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41088;How much gold should I donate to the Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41091;I need to make a decision, if I should comply with Papal will, or go my own way when it comes to the distribution of the titles in the case of a victory in the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41111;Sadly, my beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! seems to have died, I need to find a new one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41112;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! seems to have gained land, and is no longer an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41113;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! seems to have become an heir for a landed title, and is no longer an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41114;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! seems to have become a mercenary, and is no longer an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41115;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! seems to have joined a holy order, and is no longer an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41116;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! is not old enough, and is therefore not an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41117;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! is not healthy enough to be an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41118;My beneficiary §Y[old_crusade_beneficiary.GetDynName]§! have become a [old_crusade_beneficiary.GetAscetic], and is no longer an appropriate beneficiary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41120_1;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See no longer supports [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName], but rather [new_crusade_recipient.GetDynName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41120_2;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See can no longer support [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName], as [old_crusade_recipient.GetSheHe] has passed away. The Holy See now support [new_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] to be granted the titles.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41120_3;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See can no longer support [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName], as [old_crusade_recipient.GetSheHe] has passed away. The Holy See now supports [old_crusade_recipient.GetHerHis] heir [new_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the throne.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41120_4;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See has decided to start supporting you as the recipient for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName], after the death of [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41120_5;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See has decided to start supporting you as the recipient for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41121_1;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See no longer supports [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName]. With no fitting ruler, I will let you faithful men and women of the Cross decide who these titles might befit.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41121_2;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI write to inform you that the Holy See can no longer support [old_crusade_recipient.GetDynName] for the lands of [current_crusade_target_title.GetName], as [old_crusade_recipient.GetSheHe] has passed away. With no fitting ruler available, I will let you faithful men and women of the Cross decide who will receive these titles.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41131;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nThe Vatican is deeply disappointed in your decision to not join the Crusade. Your lack of faith is shocking, and I thought one could think better of a ruler such as you. \n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41144;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nI have noticed that neither you nor your troops have partaken in the Crusade you pledged to join. I am disgusted that you would dare to lie about something like this, and expect your troops to show up soon.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41147;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nYou have already received one warning, and clearly not taken heed. I consider your lack of faith and interest in keeping your promise to be unbecoming of a Christian ruler.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_41160;[From.Religion.GetHighGodName] has granted [new_crusade_most_participating_member.GetTitledName] victory in the Crusade for [new_crusade_title.GetBaseName]. [new_crusade_target_char.GetTitledName] has been beaten at every turn through the war, and [new_crusade_target_char.GetSheHe] has finally had to give up on [new_crusade_target_char.GetHerHis] holdings in [new_crusade_title.GetBaseName].\n\n[Root.GetCrusadeSelfishOrNot]\n\nWith the [new_crusade_target_char.Religion.GetGroupName]s being pushed out of their old lands, there are certainly more conflicts to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_41004;I should consider preparing my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41004_TT;The preparations for the next Crusade begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41009;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41009_TT;The Crusade for [crusade_title.GetName] begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41011;A terrible day for all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41011_TT;The Crusade has been canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41022;I guess I will go then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41031;Thanks, I appreciate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41032;I appreciate the gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41033;Maybe it is for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41034;Da pacem Domine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41035;I am inspired to do my utmost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41041;How dare [displeased_courtier.GetSheHe]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41042;That is none of [displeased_participant.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41043;Well, I don't like [displeased_participant.GetHerHim] either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41045;Unfaithful and despicable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41051;Yes, you are right your Holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41054;I wish [new_crusader_king.GetHerHim] luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41057;Thank you, Your Holiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41061;No, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41075;I thank you, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41088;I hope the Pope will appreciate this gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41091;I will let the Pope decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41091_TT;If the Crusade is won, the Pope will grant the titles to the §YPapal Crusade Recipient§!. If there is none, it will pass down to the §YBeneficiary§! of the most participating member of the Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41121;I might have someone in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41121_TT;Any pledged participant with the §YPapal Recipient Stance§! will have their stance changed to §YBeneficiary Recipient Stance§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41131;I decide what is best for my people, not you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41144;I guess... I should?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_41147;[From.GetSheHeCap] does not sound pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_41032;Let us fight the heathens together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41033;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41035;An eye for your wisdom, you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41041;Maybe it wasn't the right decision after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41045;What did [From.GetSheHe] call me!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41051;I need time to reconsider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41051_TT;Not joining nor supporting the Crusade might have dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41054;If only it could have been me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41061;Maybe in another life, it could have been me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41088;I know just how much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41091;My beneficiary will get the titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41091_TT;If the Crusade is won, and I am the most participating member of the war, the Crusade title will be granted to my §YBeneficiary§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41120;I thank you, my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_41160;Cursed infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_41004;I wish my fellow [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41022;I will support the Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41035;We will see each other again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41088;A grand gift befitting my station!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41091;Why would I give MY titles away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HFP_41091_TT;If the Crusade is won, and I am the most participating member of the war, I will take the titles for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_HFP_41088;I simply can not afford to donate anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
