EVTNAME_SoA_101;The Third Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_102;The Promised Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_550;The Kohen Gadol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SoA_100;Construction of the Third Temple will begin immediately on Temple Mount overlooking Jerusalem. The design of the new temple is greater in scope than even King Solomon's fabled First Temple. Your architects estimate that the construction will take roughly four years. When it is finished, it will truly be a sight to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_101;The First Temple, built by King Solomon, was destroyed by the invading Babylonians. The Second Temple, built under the auspices of Cyrus the Great of Persia, was razed by the Romans after a terrible siege. The Third Temple, however, built by the great [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], shall stand for all eternity!\n\nFrom its position on Temple Mount, the magnificent building has become a dominant feature of Jerusalem, instantly recognizable from far away by travellers approaching the city. Truly, Solomon himself would have been moved to tears by the sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_102;With Jerusalem and the Promised Land under Jewish control, the time is ripe for the creation of a new United Monarchy named Israel - like the great kingdom of ancient times under David and Solomon.\n\nThe long-suffering Jewish people are finally in control of their own destiny again. No longer shall the Holy Land be torn asunder by warring Christian and Muslim lords. May this new kingdom usher in an era of peace and prosperity for the region!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_105;You have decided to expel all [GetJewsName] from your realm. After your guards round the [GetJewryName] up, they are forced to depart in yet another large exodus for lands more friendly to their kind. They are allowed to keep many of their belongings, but you confiscate much of their gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_106;Jews have been banned from your realm for some time, but strangely this seems to have had no effect on many of the malaises they were thought responsible for, such as famines and disease. By now most Jews seem to have forgiven your offenses, and you have decided to welcome them back with open arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_107;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has issued a decree calling for the expulsion of all unlanded Jews from the entire realm, citing various grievances committed by them against the Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_108;Your liege, [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to rescind the decree calling for the expulsion of all Jews. They are now once more permitted to live and work within the borders of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_200;A [jewish.GetName] exile, fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe, has showed up at your court. His time spent abroad has gifted him with many connections, and by all accounts he is an able diplomat. He would make a fine chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_201;A learned [jewish.GetName] man has appeared at your court. He comes highly recommended in the arts of bookkeeping and administration. Already he has suggested several ways of improving the bureaucratic efficiency of the realm, and he could potentially make a fine steward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_202;A mysterious [jewish.GetName] man has offered his services at your court. He is well-versed in feudal court intrigue and has a past as both a mercenary and a spy. If he can be trusted, he could very well prove to be an indispensable asset in your council...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_300;The sudden expulsion of several important [jewish.GetName] merchants has done some damage to the economy of your realm. It would seem they played a bigger role in the economic development of [Root.Capital.GetName] than your advisors gave them credit for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_301;Several of the largest patrons of culture in [Root.Capital.GetName] were apparently [jewish.GetName], something your advisors were ignorant of. Since the expulsion of the [GetJewryName], cultural life all across the realm has suffered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_302;It would appear that the military of your realm was more dependent on the efforts of [jewish.GetName] men than previously thought. Since the expulsion of the [GetJewryName], several important administrative posts remain vacant and there simply aren't enough qualified men to fill them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_500;More than 2,000 years ago, God aided the Children of Israel in their escape from slavery by inflicting ten plagues upon ancient Egypt. The last of these saw a spirit of the Lord slay every first-born in Egypt, but 'pass over' Jewish homes marked with the blood of a slaughtered lamb. This festival celebrates the return of freedom to the enslaved Jewish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_501;You have been invited to join your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], at the Passover Seder [From.GetSheHe] is hosting this year. This ritual dinner is held on the first night of Passover and involves the retelling of the Exodus from Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_502;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your invitation to the Passover Seder, claiming [From.GetSheHe] has other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_503;The seder dinner has begun, as is traditional on the first night of the Passover. Matzo flatbread is consumed in liberal amounts together with bitter maror herbs. Everyone is required to drink four cups of wine, each at a specific point during the seder, as the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold and discussed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_504;The seder lasts well into the night, but all good things must end. Your vassals return home to celebrate the rest of Passover, but most seem to agree that your seder dinner was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_505;The seder lasts well into the night, but all good things must end. You return home to celebrate the rest of Passover, but you and most of the other guests seem to agree that the seder dinner was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_550;There has not been a Kohen Gadol – a High Priest of Judaism – since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. Due to a lack of suitable candidates this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the Jewish religious communities, and the Priesthood has moved into and established itself at the Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_561;The realm has benefitted from the vast network of contacts that [From.GetTitledName], your Jewish [Root.GetMyChancellorName], has fostered abroad. Somehow [From.GetSheHe] always manages to keep up to date on new customs and the latest diplomatic developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_563;[From.GetTitledName], your [Root.GetMyTreasurerName], has several contacts among the Radhanites. This Jewish merchant network supposedly stretches across the entirety of the known world, from Western Europe all the way to distant Cathay, and these contacts have been a great boon to the development of the realm's economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_565;Your [Root.GetMySpymasterName], [From.GetTitledName], seems to have friends and informants inside every Jewish community in Europe. Messenger pigeons arrive at [From.GetHerHis] abode on a daily basis, often carrying vital intelligence from abroad about new weapons and tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_566;It's time to rescind that old and absurd decree banning Jews from the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SoA_100;Our people need but wait a little longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_101;It is beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_102;Long live Israel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_105;It shall go to the Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_106;Mistakes were made. Let us not dwell on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_200;Indeed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_300;Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_301;Who needs culture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_302;Must I do everything myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_500;Send the invitations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_501;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_503;Pass the matzo, please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_504;Next year in Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_550;Long live the Kohen Gadol!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_561;Excellent work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_566;Let such injustices be consigned to history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SoA_107;Alas, this means my loan cannot be repaid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_501;Unfortunately, I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_SoA_102;The Kingdom of Israel is reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_SoA_501;Invitations to the Passover Seder dinner are sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
