EVTDESC_JD_50001;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], the Chinese '[FromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven', has died and been succeeded by [From.GetDynName]. Like [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to believe in an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] China.

The new [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], favors an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] China, and is abandoning the [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy of [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor.

EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_POLICY;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], known for [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy, has died and [From.GetDynName] now sits upon the Dragon Throne. It is said that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] especially appreciates [From.Offmap.GetLike] but despises [From.Offmap.GetDislike]. Unlike [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to favor the idea of an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_EXP;The great [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] of China has suddenly taken a keen interest in the rest of the world, particularly the West. This new Expansionist Policy could bode ill for neighboring rulers who are not in China's good graces.\n\nThe Dragon is awake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_ISO;China has gone from [FromFrom.GetPrevPolicy] to Isolationist. The [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], is turning [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] back on the barbarian world that surrounds China's perfection in order to [GetChinaIsolationPastime].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_50031_CW;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd].

EVTDESC_JD_50031_FAMINE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. China has recently been suffering from droughts and the people are starving as a Great Famine upsets the harmony in the Divine Land.

EVTDESC_JD_50031_GOLDEN;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Harmony and progress are blossoming throughout China under the benevolent rule of [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName].

EVTDESC_JD_50031_JURCHENS;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must have decided to punish the arrogance of the bureaucratic Chinese regime, for a great Jurchen Horde has recently disrupted the harmony of the 'Divine Land'. Led by their great Khagan, numberless fierce riders have crossed the Liao river and invaded Northeastern China, apparently intent on conquering the whole empire. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is slowly gathering [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] forces in [GetRandomChineseRegion], but many are already questioning whether [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] has lost the Mandate of Heaven...\n\nFor tributary states of China this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_MONGOLS;[offmap_china.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must be displeased with the Dragon Throne, for a great Mongol Horde has managed to cross the mighty fortifications of Northern China, intent on disrupting the harmony and prosperity of the 'Divine Land'. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName] is mustering [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] armies in [GetRandomChineseRegion] for a swift response, but [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] could be in for a long war...\n\nFor tributary states of China this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_PLAGUE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. The Pale Rider is sowing his deadly seeds in China - a Devastating Plague has broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion].

EVTDESC_JD_50031_UNREST;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Popular uprisings have broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion] and large groups of disgruntled peasants have taken up arms, led by [GetRandomChineseFaction].

EVTDESC_JD_50141_BOOST;With China already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Mongol Horde has decided to exploit the situation and has crossed into Northern China. Will the fierce horsemen from the endless steppes manage to break the Dragon's back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50141_PENALTY;Right when China is experiencing an almost unprecedented [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Mongol Horde has crossed into Hebei, intent on conquering the whole empire, but the Dragon is mighty and the fierce steppe warriors are in for a titanic struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50161;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the veteran armies of China finally managed to win a decisive battle near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Mongol Khagan was slain and his Kheshig guards slaughtered to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_50181_BOOST;With China already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], an additional misfortune has struck the Middle Kingdom - the Jurchen tribes from the Yalu river have united under a great Khagan.

Many think that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is weak and has lost the Mandate of Heaven. Even as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] cowers in [GetRandomChineseRegion], massive rebel armies are on the move, attacking loyalist strongholds. Still, the rebels have not yet gathered under a single leader, and different factions are even fighting each other. Silk Road profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - China will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50301;The Chinese Civil War has come to an abrubt end. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] utterly crushed the main rebel army in [GetRandomChineseRegion], ending the long years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances between loyalists, rabble-rousing monks, dynastic pretenders and an overly ambitious governor.

EVTOPT_JD_50001_ISO;Time for the [From.GetEmperorEmpress] to [GetChinaIsolationPastime]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
