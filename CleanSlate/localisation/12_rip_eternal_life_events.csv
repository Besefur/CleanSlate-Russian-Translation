EVTDSC_RIP_21001;Your council convenes and the faces of your advisors speak of confusion. "Why are we here, my [Root.GetLordLady]?" It comes with a hint of concern. You sit down and the suspense is almost tangible, as you leave the question hanging in the air. Finally you speak and without disclosing much of your current nightly restlessness, you convey the message eloquently enough... \n\n"I want to discuss the concept of life and death. And... I want to look into everlasting life." They nod, slowly. "So what do you think?" \n\nThe spirit rises in the room as your councillors start to talk, some hesitantly, some gesturing wildly. They all have ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21006;You asked several people in your court, and even waited for a long time for some of them to get back to you, but none of them have heard of a method to avoid the whole mess of dying. You reckon it's a lot like sleeping though? You probably shouldn't worry about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21007;Several months have passed since you put out your request regarding knowledge on increased lifespans. However, no one has come forward and your council has grown increasingly indifferent about the issue. You are starting to wonder whether the knowledge exists at all? If it does, is it maybe not meant to be found? You still have trouble sleeping.\n\nYou will return to your normal life, you suppose, cherishing whatever days you have left. The sun sets, and it rises again. Who knows for how long you will rise with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21008;As per your orders your [Root.GetChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] has been corresponding with all the important scholarly nobles of the known world. Some of them have been intrigued by the enquiries put forward. Others have been skeptical, while some have been outright dismissive. However, a select few have been relaying mysterious rumors from the north, stories sounding nothing short of magic. \n\n[Root.job_chancellor.GetFirstName] informs you that one contact in particular is worried about the repercussions if it became known that they have been entertaining these borderline heretic ideas. "It pains me to say, my [Root.GetLordLady], but this sort of gossip does not come for free" [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] says, brows furrowed. "I may be a diplomat, but I'm not a hypnotist.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21009;I'm not going to say I believe the stories, but we have picked up some promising information, my [Root.GetLordLady] [eternal_life_advisor.GetTitledFirstName] says. "However, we could do with some more supplies if we are to journey even further. In fact, I would like to send word to hire scouts in certain more distant regions, if we are to follow the leads and continue this... Mission." [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHeCap] pauses at the door, [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] posture strained. "Of course, there are other ways to reach eternity," [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] sighs. When you open your mouth to respond, indignantly, [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] interrupts you: "I suppose the attitude comes with the job, [Root.GetMasterMistress]. My apologies."\n\n Your [Root.GetMarshalName] exits the room, [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] steps growing fainter as you consider your options...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21010;Your [Root.GetSpymasterName] finds you in the night, startling you awake. "Sorry, [Root.GetMasterMistress], but the walls have ears. I dared not come during the day" [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] says. "Somebody is on my track, I could use some help throwing them off my scent. No no, don't worry, it means that we're getting close", [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] whispers, a confident smirk only just visible on [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"There's a legend, you see, and... Well, we're very close to locating a certain person who can help, but we're not the only ones looking for her...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21011;When you check up on [eternal_life_advisor.GetTitledFirstName] to inquire about the search, you find [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHim] slumped over [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] books, sound asleep. You clear your throat loudly and [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] sits up straight, drowsy eyes darting panickedly around the room, before suppressing a yawn. \n\n"Sorry, [Root.GetMasterMistress], I must've dozed off. Truth be told, I am starting to give up... To make it through all these scriptures, I think I need an assistant. Or ten." [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHeCap] rolls [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] eyes, then looks down, abashedly. "I'm sorry, my [Root.GetLordLady], I'll make do, of course.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21013_CHANCELLOR;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] [eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] is beaming. "You know how [eternal_life_random_diplomat.GetTitledFirstName] can be, I had to make sure that it was [eternal_life_random_diplomat.GetHerHis] son who mentioned it first and then it was easy to make it seem [eternal_life_random_diplomat.GetHerHis] idea in the first place and, well... I won't bore you with ALL the details" [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] says, clearly excited to have something noteworthy to tell you. When you roll your eyes for the third time [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] finally pulls it together and skips to the part about a mystic woman, allegedly traveling the whole world, strange wonders following her footsteps. \n\n"Oh, [Root.GetMasterMistress], I think you should invite her here," [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] urges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21013_MARSHAL;Your [Root.GetMarshalName] [eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] looks lost for words. "[Root.GetMasterMistressCap], I am not sure what to think". [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHeCap] shakes [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] head as [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] searches for the correct way to phrase [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerselfHimself]. "My [Root.GetTitle], she is... impressive. I can't quite put my finger on it. Not to mention she has traveled far." [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHisCap] face conveys uncertainty and [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] shifts [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] weight. "I see", you say, scratching your head.\n\n[eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] breaks the silence: "My [Root.GetLordLady], I can still send her away. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21013_SPIRITUAL;Your court [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] [eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] hesitantly leads you to his chamber. "This is... Highly unorthodox, my [Root.GetMasterMistress]. But I assure you, all our research points to the lady you are about to meet. She has traveled a long way, from the distant lands in the East, to come and see you. A quite remarkable lady, if I say so myself..." \n\nYou ask [eternal_life_advisor.GetTitledFirstName] about this mysterious woman and her teachings, but [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] avoids your questions and insists that it will be better if you ask her yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21013_SPYMASTER;You are almost used to your [Root.GetSpymasterName] [eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] visiting your chambers at the strangest hours, but you still jump when [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] steps out from the shadows one evening. "It wasn't easy, but we got something, my [Root.GetLordLady]," [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe] says calmly, as if clandestine meetings had become the norm for social interaction. You compose yourself before asking "what?", your voice not quite concealing your irritation.\n\nPerhaps you were foolish to investigate eternal life? You could be setting yourself up to be duped, or so the whispers go. \n\n"There's a mystic. She... is something else" [eternal_life_advisor.GetFirstName] says, interrupting your thoughts. "Should I bring her to you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21014;A stranger has appeared at your court. "She says she will only speak to you, my [Root.GetLordLady]," a servant bows before you, clearly annoyed. You pause. What is this about? The times are busy in [Root.Capital.GetName] and you were in the middle of contemplating whether you should have a grand feast thrown in your name or arrange for a prestigious hunting trip. There is always someone to impress, and you would rather not get involved in the drama of the court. You glance at the servant, still bowing deeply. Very well...\n\nIn the main hall a hooded figure approaches you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21017;In spite of all [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] efforts [eternal_life_advisor.GetTitledFirstName]'s search for information on how to prolong the life of [eternal_life_advisor.GetHerHis] [Root.GetMasterMistress] has turned up fruitless. Disappointment is written all over your face as you rise to leave the council meeting. [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHeCap] avoids your gaze for months, but [eternal_life_advisor.GetSheHe]'s not the only one. Whenever you enter the room nowadays people grow quiet. \n\nThe rumor says you're dying. In a sense it is true, but aren't we all? You still have trouble sleeping. \n\nWas life always this awkward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_DIPLOMACY_A;You expected a wrinkled old crone, but the alleged mystic standing before you is something entirely different. The young woman who introduces herself as [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] is a breath-taking beauty. Her voice is soft as lambs wool and her smile bright as a summer sun. You invite her to dine with you and her conversation is most intriguing. She claims to hold the secrets to eternal life and vitality and offers to teach you more, if you are willing to accept her quest.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know if this fair maiden speaks the truth, at least she seems very experienced for her tender age. But is she immortal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_DIPLOMACY_B;You expected a wrinkled old crone, but the alleged mystic standing before you is something entirely different. Although she is very different compared to all the other women at court, no one can deny that her beauty is breath-taking. With a voice as soft as lambs wool and tinged with a foreign accent she introduces herself as [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]. You invite her to dine with you and her conversation is most intriguing, if not outright controversial at times. She claims to hold the secrets to eternal life and vitality and offers to teach you more, if you are willing to accept her quest. \n\nWhile it is impossible to know if this fair maiden speaks the truth, at least she seems very experienced for her tender age. But is she immortal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_INTRIGUE_A;The old woman introduces herself as [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] and proceeds to tell you about the noble art of alchemy. She claims to possess the secret knowledge of transmuting the base metals into gold and creating something she calls "alkahest". However, more importantly, she tells you tales of the mysterious Philosopher's Stone which grants its maker eternal life. If you accept her quest, she promises to share her secrets with you.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know if this alleged mystic tells the truth, at least she looks the part. Judging from her wrinkles and hunched back she must be very old. But is she immortal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_INTRIGUE_B;The old, peculiar woman introduces herself as [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName]. At least that is what you think she said - her words are distorted with a foreign accent. She claims to possess the secret knowledge of transmuting the base metals into gold, and more importantly, she tells you tales of the mysterious Philosopher's Stone. If you are to believe her words, it grants its maker eternal life. \n\nWhile you normally would not be inclined to trust a woman like this, her words do intrigue you. In any case she looks the part - judging from her wrinkles and hunched back she must be very old. But is she immortal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_LEARNING_A;When you heard about the alleged mystic you pictured someone very youthful. However, you did not picture a child. \n\nThe little girl, who calls herself [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName], is unlike any child you have ever met. Her manners are incredibly mature and she seems to be far more knowledgeable than your most educated advisors. She tells you tales of faraway realms and distant times, heavy with symbolism and hidden meanings. While it is very strange to hear such wise words spoken by a mere child, the vividness of her stories makes you wonder if she experienced them all herself. She promises to tell you more if you accept her as a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_LEARNING_B;When you heard about the alleged mystic you pictured someone very youthful. However, you did not picture a child. At first, you are inclined to laugh - who is this bizarre little girl? However, you can tell within minutes that [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] is no ordinary child. Her somber manners are actually rather unsettling. \n\nShe tells you tales of faraway realms and distant times, heavy with symbolism and hidden meanings. While it is very strange to hear such words spoken by someone so young, the vividness of her stories makes you wonder if she experienced them all herself. She promises to tell you more if you accept her as a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_MARTIAL_A;The tall figure offers you a nod, but does not smile. She eyes you skeptically, measuring you up as much as you are her. Her clothing is modest and her posture clearly that of a warrior's. "I am [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName]. You are [Root.GetFirstName]," she says, as if somebody had forgotten to introduce you. Perhaps you should have spoken the first words, to assert your position, but the muscular woman makes you more than a little nervous. \n\n"I hear you are looking to live forever," she finally says, more a statement than question. "I can help.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21019_MARTIAL_B;The tall figure offers you a nod, but does not smile. She eyes you skeptically, measuring you up as much as you are her. Her clothing, possibly intended to be modest, is foreign to you and you have trouble concealing your confusion. In fact, the warrior woman before you is bound to stand out in your court in more ways than one. "I am [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName]. You are [Root.GetFirstName]," she says, as if somebody had forgotten to introduce you. Perhaps you should have spoken the first words, to assert your position, but the muscular woman makes you more than a little nervous.\n\n"I hear your are looking to live forever," she finally says, more a statement than question. "I can help.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21099_OTHER_DEATH;As if fate is playing a cruel joke on me my guide to eternal life, [eternal_life_mystic.GetBestName], has passed on. Alone I try to walk the path she set me on, but without her helping hand I fumble in the dark... Is the path to immortality forever hidden from me now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21099_YOU_MURDERED;I try to walk the path to eternal life that [eternal_life_mystic.GetBestName] set me on without her help, but I am blind without her guidance. I cannot do anything but chuckle, my path to immortality has been severed by death caused by my own two hands – the irony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21100;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] tells you a tale about a hidden glade in which an ancient apple tree grows. The apples are the most delicious in the world, but more importantly, anyone who eats them become young anew. She offers to help you find the glade, but she also warns you that the search will not be easy and potentially very dangerous. \n\n[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] urges you to form a fellowship of brave warriors to aid you in your quest. While you could just order some of your soldiers to tag along, she insists that they must follow you out of loyalty, not only by duty. She suggests that you arrange a grand feast and speak to them from your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21102;It is the night of your feast yet quite a few of those invited are missing. You grumble that you ought to have just ordered them to attend. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] soothingly pets your arm and assures you that you can still turn things around. \n\nHalfway through the dinner, you stand up to hold you speech. So far the night has been a failure and this fact does not exactly boost your confidence. Your listeners must notice this, because soon their gazes start to drift and they fidget uncomfortably in their seats. In the end you cannot stand it. You cut your speech short and bitterly order all your guests to leave. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] gives you one last disappointed look before leaving with the rest of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21104;It is the night of your feast and warriors have come from far and wide. The word must have spread because there are far more guests than expected. Luckily, with [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s help you manage to make room for everybody and after raiding the stores there is enough food and wine to go around. The music is jolly, the spirits are high and laughter echoes in your hall. \n\nHalfway through the dinner, you stand up to hold you speech. At first you are nervous, but when you see the fervor light up in the guests' eyes, your confidence rises. You deliver the best and most passionate speech of your life. By the end of it, the crowd stands up, howling and applauding. You look to your right where [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] is seated– she is beaming at you. It seems like you have your fellowship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21110;Ever since [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] announced that the time for the search was nigh you have been busy with preparations. The warriors are equipped, the provisions gathered and the best horses procured. Yesterday you finally set out on your quest. \n\n[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] has led your fellowship deeper and deeper into the wilderness. The trail which you follow is barely visible in the thick underbrush, but [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] seems certain this is the right path. The trail begins to slope upwards and within a few hours you are trudging up a narrow mountain path. The trail makes a sharp turn and as you pass it you spot an obstacle overhead. There has been a rockfall and boulders are blocking the path. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] insists that this trail is the only way forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21112;You cannot do this without your fierce followers. However, they seem doubtful, so you attempt to raise their spirits and lead by example. You call out to draw their attention and proceed to inform them of your plan. While you do so, you pick a decently sized boulder and begin to shift it. At least you attempt to– however, it does not move an inch. Your companions do not seem convinced so you buckle down and really give it all you've got. Embarrassingly your efforts have no other outcome than a sweaty brow and scraped hands. You call for help but your breathless voice is less than inspiring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21114;You cannot do this without your fierce followers. However, they seem doubtful, so you attempt to raise their spirits with an inspirational speech. Your strong voice echoes in the mountain pass and yet again you can see the fire in your companions' eyes. They throw themselves into the task without hesitation and together you toil for many hours. Sweat and blood is your price but when dusk arrives, the path is cleared. Triumphantly [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] grabs your hand and raises it above your heads. Your followers are exhausted, but this fact does not dampen their excited cheers. \n\nTomorrow your journey continues. While there is still some way to go, [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] assures you that the path ahead will not cause you too much trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21116;You cannot do this without your fierce followers. However, they seem doubtful, so you attempt to raise their spirits and lead by example. You call out to draw their attention and proceed to inform them of your plan. By using your spear as a makeshift lever you attempt to shift the biggest of the boulders. It does move an inch, but before it starts to roll the spear snaps in your hand and the end smacks you right between the eyes. No one comes to your aid. Angered by their passive manners, you snatch the spear from the man standing closest to you and try again. Your temper makes you careless and before you know it, the ground shifts underneath your feet. The boulder plummets down into the ravine but so do you. The echoes of your terrified screams outlast your final breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21120;After many months in the harsh wilderness you have finally reached the glade. Here, the breeze is warm and the sky clear, and the ground is covered in a sea of brightly colored flowers. In the midst of the clearing stands a great old tree, its branches reaching far higher than the surrounding canopy. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] points towards the top of the tree where you can see a single apple, shining red like a ruby in the afternoon sun. \n\nYou are about to enter the clearing when you hear a call from behind. It is one of your companions, a reserved fellow with whom you have only exchanged a few words. He questions why you should be the one to eat the apple when everyone has contributed equally on the journey. You can tell by the look on their faces that some of the others feel the same way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21122;Once the man is done speaking, you agree that the matter must be properly considered before a decision is made. You appoint the man to be the warriors' spokesperson and invite him to your tent for supper.\n\nWhen the two of you are alone, you make your offer. While you might not get the apple, he probably won't, either. A safer bet would be to support your claim in exchange for a heavy purse of coins. The man hesitates but then accepts.\n\nLater that evening when you argue your cause the man says you have got him convinced and supports your claim. All other opposition melts away. You walk up to the tree, [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] at your side. "Congratulations, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," she murmurs with a smile. "Eternal life is finally yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21124;You courteously let the man finish, making a note of all his arguments. You then proceed to crush them, one by one, with the most eloquent speech of your life. You plead to their logic as well as to their hearts. Are you not the same [Root.GetManWoman] whom they pledged their loyalties to? Are you not their rightful and honorable liege? If you have their support, your gratefulness will be eternal. You will secure the future of their dynasties and their names will live on forever. By the end of your appeal there is a moment of absolute stillness and silence. Then the instigator kneels before you, tears in his eyes, and offers to bring you the apple himself. You have succeeded. \n\nIt is dusk when the man returns from the tree with the apple in his hand. "Congratulations, [Root.GetMasterMistress]," [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] murmurs with a smile as you bite into the fruit. "Eternal life is finally yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21125;Once the man is done speaking, you agree that the matter must be properly considered before a decision is made. You appoint the man to be the warriors' spokesperson and invite him to your tent for supper. When the two of you are alone, you make your offer. His support for your claim in exchange for a heavy purse of coins. The man hesitates but then accepts. \n\nLater that evening you argue your cause. When you have finished your speech, you expectantly turn towards the man. The words that come out of his mouth are not the ones you expected, however. He exposes your attempt to bribe him and fires up the others. You start to run for the tree but the angry mob catches up within moments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21126;You interrupt the instigator. Are you not the same [Root.GetManWoman] whom they gladly pledged their loyalties to? Are you not their rightful and honored liege? When you finish your appeal there is a moment of silence. Then the instigator nods slowly and agrees to fetch you the apple himself. Relieved, you thank him. This could have ended badly! \n\nYou nervously watch from below as the man climbs the tree. It is very tall and on more than one occasion he looks perilously close to falling. When he finally reaches the top of the tree, you shout in triumph, but your happiness is soon thwarted – with a defiant look, the man sinks his teeth into the apple himself. You glance at [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName], panic in your eyes, but she only shakes her head wistfully. It is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21200;[eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] sits on the floor when you enter the room, what looks like polished pieces of bone strewn out in front of her. She motions for you to join her. "You have neglected your spirit" she says, eyes closed. You shift uncomfortably in your seat. "I have not" you mumble. Her eyes open at this and she stares at you, a steely cold look and you retract your statement. "You must sacrifice" she declares. "Very well" you reply, thinking you'll have your learned [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] see to it. As if she could read your mind [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] shakes her head: "You must do this on your own. Do you see what I see?" \n\nYou notice a pattern in the bones. It looks just like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21202_A;All was well until you tried placing the animal on the ceremonial stone slab and you were surprised at its strength. It moves wildly under your hands, refusing to have its neck pressed to the rock. "I don't want to do this," you think for a brief moment, as a sharp dagger is handed to you. [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] watches you intently, her stern face void of motion, and you find yourself wondering if she possesses any feelings at all or if she carries herself by duty alone?\n\nSuddenly pain shoots through your arm, as the flailing antelope bites down hard on your hand. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] reacts instantly and swings her sword at the creature, chopping its head right off, but your fingers are already gone. There is blood EVERYWHERE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21202_B;You anxiously carry the torch to the altar, where three full barrels of grain stand neatly together. [eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] watches you intently, her stern face void of motion, and you find yourself wondering if she possesses any feelings at all, or if she carries herself by duty alone? Such a straight back. Such discipline! You can see why she would inspire respect and the thought makes you nervous. \n\nThe momentary distraction causes you to lose focus and you realize that the flames are now licking on your sleeves, spreading quickly up your arm. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] reacts almost instantly, throwing her cloak around you, but the fire won't go out! You are screaming, the pain too much to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21204_A;[eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] hands you a beautiful dagger. The antelope, held down on a stone slab, is surprisingly calm. "Thank you" you say quietly to the animal - you hesitate only a second before slicing its throat. The blood pours down the altar and [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] nods solemnly. Your heart flutters at the notion of having pleased the statuesque character. \n\n"Your grandfathers and mothers would be proud" [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] announces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21204_B;[eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] hands you the torch. Placed carefully next to each other three barrels, filled to the brim with fine grain, await your approach. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] nods at you from the altar and starts chanting something, using words you have never heard before. You step up to the altar and lower the torch to one of the barrels, to let the flames have their way. \n\n[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] eventually stops speaking and she looks at you, approval, albeit faint, definitely readable on her face. You smile broadly. \n\n"Your grandfathers and mothers would approve of this" [eternal_life_mystic.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21210;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] knocks on your door one evening, carrying a large ceramic jar, animal motifs and ornaments encircling it. Puzzled, you invite her in and pull out two chairs. "Student [Root.GetFirstName], I am pleased with the sacrifice you performed," she says, sitting down on the floor. She places the jar in front of her. "Your ancestors are surely appeased, but I thought it would be a good time to prove to them your strength further."\n\nAs she removes the lid from the jar you hear a hissing noise. A large snake spring launches at you and you are left to your instincts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21212;Before you have even time to react the snake bares its fangs. Heading straight for you, seemingly flying, it bites you in your neck. The creature hisses, slithers around you and begins to move upwards. "Nooo, not the face!" you yell, flailing your arms wildly. "[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName], help me!"\n\nAfter what seems like an eternity [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] rises from her spot and steps in to grab the snake by its neck, her voice soothing it as it obediently pours back into the jar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21214_A;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s eyes widen as you, with the speed of a heron, reach out and grab the snake by its neck. The creature writhes in your hand and you proceed to slam it against a table, hard. In a state of panic you repeat the action several times before you hear [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s steady voice getting through to you: "[Root.GetMasterMistressCap]. The soul is gone. You can let it go... You did good."\n\nThe snake is limp in your hold. Your palms are sweaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21214_B;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] sits calmly as you quickly, but not quite gracefully, grab the heavy tome and slam it uncomfortably hard into the side of the snake. The creature bounces off to the other end of the room where you follow it, frantically stomping on the floor while the animal wriggles around your feet. When it stops you are panting, and you look around to see [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] looking at you, motionlessly. \n\n "It wasn't venomous, was it?" you frown. \n"Not at all," she replies, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21216;Before you have even time to react the snake bares its fangs. Heading straight for you, seemingly flying, it bites you in your neck. The creature hisses, slithers around you and moves upwards. "Nooo, not the face!" you yell, flailing your arms wildly. "[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName], help me!"\n\nAfter what seems like an eternity [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] rises from her spot and steps in to grab the snake by its neck, her voice soothing it as it obediently pours back into the jar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # Same as 21212?
EVTDSC_RIP_21220;When you after a long wait are summoned to [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s chambers again you are excited. What mystical challenge lies ahead of you this time? There's a spring in your step as you enter to find her standing like a statue - head bowed, hands holding something to you. Sometimes you wonder what she does when you're not around. Does she even move?\n"What's this?" you ask.\n"Magic," she says naturally. "The time has come for your spirit to choose its next vessel. No, don't be afraid! The breath of life within you is powerful enough to be passed on. You should be proud." \nShe hands you a waterskin and motions to the floor. Then she begins to hum - it is both melodic and eerie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21222;You are floating in space. When you turn around it feels as though you are moving under water and you can't seem to make a sound. There is a melody in your head that you can't quite wrap your head around - it is both soothing and frustrating. It is pulling at you, drawing you in. Suddenly you are moving at incredible speed! Just as you are trying to catch a glimpse of the little spot of light you are shooting towards, you realize it is you, yourself, lying on the floor. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] leans over you, trying to wake you. \n\nYou crash into your own body and the first breath you draw feels magnificent. "The seed of life is in you still. And I don't think you're the only one in there any more", [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] says contentedly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21224;The floor is hard, and the words chanted by [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] make no sense to you. It is a language you do not understand and the melody has no pattern to it. Your eyes closed, you grow a little irritated by the whole situation. Maybe it is natural to move on to the next realm, who are you to stop it? Who is [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] to have you go through these trials?\n\n"It's happening!" [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] exclaims suddenly, and you feel like you exploded, like you are sucked into space, then thrown back into your body again, all within the blink of an eye. When you sit up, bewildered, the mystic smiles at you.\n\n"You're hosting your grandfathers in your body. They will keep you alive, for many days to come" she says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21226;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s chanting grows faint as you find yourself floating upwards, looking down at your own body. The room has a strange purple hue to it, as if twilight had fallen. Yet it shouldn't have? The mystic leans in over your body, touching your forehead, and she speaks but you can't make out what she is saying. You struggle to move closer to her through the air, but you feel like you are under water, your limbs heavy, your movement slowed to a crawl. You try to call her attention by screaming, but no sound comes out. Suddenly she turns around, not seeing you, but sensing your presence. She moves her hand through the air where you hang and smiles. You can barely make out the words she says: "You are a brave warrior, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], and your spirit is strong. I hope we meet again.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21227;The chanting quickly begins to feel repetitive. You try to relax, but something doesn't feel right. Who are you play at things like life and death? You just want to be left alone! Sometimes you even wonder whether you're a good ruler or not, and how can one know? \n\nYou feel the warrior mystic placing a hand on your sweaty forehead. Her skin is cool to the touch and you are suddenly grateful. Maybe this is not so bad after all? Then you hear someone talking excitedly. You are overcome with an urge to hush them as they are disturbing the ritual. Then you hear more voices. Your eyes still closed you start to twist and turn, and a convulsing nausea takes you over. "Oh, no," you hear [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] utter worriedly before the voices start screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21300;[eternal_life_mystic.GetTitledFirstName] explains that you need to obtain the ingredients known as the Three Primes, the first of which is salt. When you offer to send a servant to the kitchen, she protests. "The art of alchemy is not simply one of collecting ingredients and mixing potions. In order to create the Philosopher's Stone, you must also create a better self." \n\nThe old crone insist that you must conquer your body by mastering the art of pickpocketing. Being of noble birth, you have never needed to resort to such methods, but you do pride yourself on being deft of hand. It cannot be that hard, can it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21302;The day of the first trial has arrived. You have dressed yourself as a lowly commoner and left your guards behind. It is a strange feeling, walking through the crowded market as if you were no one special. Instead of giving way, people walk right into you and spit curses as you stumble. You are starting to feel uneasy and decide to hurry up and get it over with.\n\nHowever, your nerves seem to have gotten the better of you and you make a dreadful mess of your attempt. Within seconds, the spice merchant's guards are pressing your face into the ground. "Don't hurt me! I am [Root.GetBestName]!" you shout in panic. "Yes, and I am [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]," the merchant scoffs and turns to his guards. "Show this dreg what we do with thieves.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21304;The day of the first trial has arrived. You have dressed yourself as a lowly commoner and left your guards behind. It is a strange feeling, walking through the crowded market as if you were no one special. No one is looking your way and your confidence is growing. However, you decide to take your time. There is no need to rush. \n\nYour patience pays off when you are presented with the perfect opportunity to slip your hand into the spice merchant's pocket. Before you know it, you are on your way back to the keep with the stolen salt in your pouch, and nobody saw a thing. You are really getting the hang of this! On your return the otherwise grouchy [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] greets you with a pleased smirk. "You did well. Rest now, my [Root.GetLordLady]. The next trial will not be as easy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21310;You almost jump out of your skin when [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] suddenly steps out from behind a corner. "Heading to bed already, my [Root.GetLordLady]? The night has only begun." Apparently it is time for your next trial and this time you must acquire brimstone. "This one is a trial of the mind, [Root.GetMasterMistress]. You must go to the laboratory and produce the Prime yourself. You have until dawn." Before she disappears again, she hands you a dusty tome. \n\nYou spend several hours desperately trying to make sense of the tome's archaic language. The text seems to mention two different methods– one of which looks very complicated, however the simpler one runs the risk of producing a violent explosion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21312;You keep staring at the tome's pages for another couple hours, but your mind is hazy with sleep and the letters only dance before your eyes. The candle is burning low and dawn is fast approaching. You must make your attempt now– it is better to fail than to never grasp the opportunity at all. \n\nYou assemble what you think are the proper instruments and get started. The outcome of each step does not at all match the descriptions in the book but you hope for the best and keep going. However, when the first rays of morning light fall through the window you have succeeded with nothing except filling the laboratory with a putrid smell. When [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] enters, she only gives you a displeased look, half disappointment and half disgust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21314;Despite the late hour, your mind feels as sharp as a razor. While the tome's language troubled you at first, you now feel confident that you have interpreted every detail correctly. The method makes perfect sense and you barely have to glance at the instructions when you assemble all the instruments and ingredients. \n\nAfter each step, the outcome is identical to the one described in the tome. Your confidence is rising– you are almost there! However, you make sure that your high spirits do not get the better of you, and proceed at a steady pace. When [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] enters at dawn, you present her with vial filled with yellow shards. "Well done, [Root.GetMasterMistress]!" she exclaims with one of her rare smiles. "Only one Prime left!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21316;You cannot endure the thought of doing nothing but waiting for your impending demise. Life is short and only immortality can grant you peace of mind. You are certain that you grasped all the details of your chosen method– all you need now is a steady hand. \n\nAfter each step, the outcome is identical to the one described in the tome. Your confidence is rising– you are almost there! Your high spirits make you move swifter, but you do not notice. Not until it is too late. At the very last step, you slip and drop the vial in your hand. You do not even have time to flinch before you are engulfed in the roaring flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21320;The third and most elusive of the Three Primes is the metal known as quicksilver, [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] announced as she entered your study this morning. Now it is dusk, and she has brought you far from civilization to an abandoned mine. "Here you will perform the last and most dangerous trial, my [Root.GetLordLady]. You will spend the night in this haunted place. If you exit with a piece of quicksilver ore, you have succeeded, and eternal life will be yours. However, if you fail, the ghosts of the past will likely drive you mad– or worse." \n\nYou have wandered the narrow tunnels for almost an hour when a spine-chilling wail echo from the darkness. You freeze– is this one of the ghosts [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] mentioned?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21322;You hesitantly call out for the ghost. At first, nothing happens, and you think you must have been mistaken. Then suddenly an ear-deafening roar breaks the silence. You turn on your heel and run for your life, but stumble almost instantly. As the roar grows louder you fear that this is the end, but a rush of wind passes by above your head and then everything is silent. When you get back up, you spot the rock you tripped over. A crimson piece of mercury ore! \n\nYou raise the rock triumphantly above your head as you step into the daylight. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] greets you with a pleased laugh. "Excellent, [Root.GetMasterMistress]. Tonight, we will create the Philosopher's Stone, and immortality will be yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21324;Quietly you walk back to the last intersection and continue your search down another tunnel. How much time has passed? Hours or days, it is impossible to tell. Your own breath has grown so loud in your ears and you keep seeing the same rock formations over and over again... When you trip on a rock you just lay there for a few minutes, contemplating surrender. However, when you do get up, you spot the rock you tripped over. A crimson piece of mercury ore! \n\nYou raise the rock triumphantly above your head as you step into the daylight. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] greets you with a pleased laugh. "Excellent, [Root.GetMasterMistress]. Tonight, we will create the Philosopher's Stone, and immortality will be yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21325;You stumble down the dark corridor and hesitantly call out for the ghost. You instantly regret your decision as you are answered with an ear-deafening roar. It is followed by a gust of wind which extinguishes your torch. You turn on your heel and run for your life, but trip after only a few steps. A taste of blood fills your mouth and the roar grows louder, shaking you to your very core. There is no point trying to get up. You close your eyes and await your doom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21326;Quietly you walk back to the last intersection and continue your search down another tunnel. How much time has passed? Hours or days, it is impossible to tell. Your own breath has grown so loud in your ears and you keep seeing the same rock formations over and over again... As your limbs grow weaker, your panic increases in strength, and soon you are shouting for help. Your own words echo back at you, warped by the tunnels. Are they even yours? You can no longer recognize them... You wander the tunnels, howling and weeping, until your knees buckle and you fall unconscious. \n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, you feel soft rain on your face. You have no idea how you made it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21400_A;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] and you are walking side by side through the capital as she patiently explains the principles of reincarnation and immortality. "[Root.GetFirstName], my friend. Remember that Karma is not only produced when you act. Everything you think, say and cause is also Karma. While good deeds yield sweet fruits, Punya, unkindness brings forth spoiled fruits, Paap." \n\nYour walk has brought you to a rundown alley where a man in tattered clothes sleeps in a doorway. As you approach, the stench of alcohol and vomit becomes unbearable. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] tells you that the man was cheated of all his savings and how he fell into despair when the local authorities refused to help him. The tale fills you with compassion for the poor fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21400_B;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] and you are walking side by side through the capital as she patiently explains the principles of reincarnation and immortality. "[Root.GetFirstName], my friend. Remember that Karma is not only produced when you act. Everything you think, say and cause is also Karma. While good deeds yield sweet fruits, Punya, unkindness brings forth spoiled fruits, Paap." \n\nYour walk has brought you to a rundown alley where a man in tattered clothes sleeps in a doorway. As you approach, the stench of alcohol and vomit becomes unbearable. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] tells you that the man was cheated of all his savings and how he fell into despair when the local authorities refused to help him. It seems like [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] want you to pity him but you cannot force yourself to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21402_A;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] folds her arms over her chest and frowns. If she was just any child you would have laughed, but [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s disapproval fills you with worry. Did you not do the right thing? \n\n"I see now that I was mistaken on your account, [Root.GetFirstName]. While it is easy to say the good word and do the good deed, I can tell that you are not thinking the good thought. You do not truly care about this man. Before you can grow, you must be honest with your failings. I am afraid you are not ready to embrace my teachings.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21402_B;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] folds her arms over her chest and frowns. If she was just any child you would have laughed, but [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] looks quite menacing. \n\n"What did I just tell you about Karma and the spoiled fruit of bad actions? It will only come back and punish you, [Root.GetFirstName]. I am afraid you are not ready to embrace my teachings.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21404_A;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] nods contentedly as you kneel next to the man and offer him your coin purse. "The fruit of good thoughts and good deeds is sweet indeed, my friend. Acts of kindness brings peace to your heart and brings you one step closer to enlightenment. You are a just ruler, indeed." \n\nDuring the walk home, your heart does feel lighter. You intently listen to [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s thoughtful musings, trying to remember every word. She might be the true saint you have been waiting for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21404_B;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] nods contentedly at your words. "Most people understand the value of compassion and a good deed, but few understand the true meaning of honesty. Before we can grow, we must learn to accept our failings. You have taken the first step on the journey." \n\n[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s words really resonate with you and during the walk home you intently listen to her lesson. You soak up every word and decide to make a change in your life. If you have taken the first step, surely taking the next will be easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21410;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] has been happy with your progress and informed you that the time had come for a period of deep introspection. "You must venture into the wilderness all on your own, my friend, with nothing but the clothes on your back. You are to stay there until you have had a deep epiphany." You are not quite sure what an epiphany feels like, but [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] assured you that all will become clear in time. \n\nNow you have spent four days in isolation, fasting and meditating. Your mind does feel clearer, however you are not sure if you are approaching your epiphany or if the lack of sustenance is making you delirious. While [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] ordered you to abstain from food, she cannot see you now, and the hunger is becoming quite unbearable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21412;Finally it arrives. The moment of perfect clarity. All of your senses are on edge - each expression as distinguished and detailed as if you experienced everything for the first time. It is as if your mind's expanding, reaching out, enveloping everything. You can feel that the realization is there, just beyond your limits. You just have to... \n\nYou wake up with a jerk. Everything aches. Your back, your stomach, your head... You lay there for a moment, doing and thinking nothing, before crawling up to seated. The feeling of elation you had a moment ago is gone as if it was never there. It was all a dream. In reality your mind is as murky as a stagnant pond. You are not making any progress, and have not done for several days. Unfortunately this seems to be beyond your abilities... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21414;Finally it arrives. The moment of perfect clarity. All of your senses are on edge - each expression as distinguished and detailed as if you experienced everything for the first time. It is as if your mind is expanding, reaching out, enveloping everything. You can feel that the realization is there, just beyond your limits. You just have to... \n\nAnd then it is as if something snaps within you. Some limitation which has always held you back is gone and now everything makes sense. Each of [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]'s lessons is rushing through your mind, each word as clear as if she was standing next to you. You sit there for a while, just taking everything in, paralyzed with amazement. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21416;Finally it arrives. The moment of perfect clarity. You can feel that the realization is there, just beyond your limits. You clamber back to your feet and start running. Almost there... \n\nThen, sudden terror, the sensation of falling. It only last for a moment before it is replaced by an overwhelming pain radiating from your ankle. You lay there on the ground for a few moments, gasping for air like a fish out of water. When the world comes back into focus, you see the cliff above. Did you run off it...? \n\nYou shout for help until your voice is raw, but you know it is all in vain. You have not seen a single soul in days, and most likely you never will again. When the night arrives and wraps you in its cold embrace, you close your eyes and let go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21420;[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] was most pleased to hear about your epiphany in the wilderness. Since then she has been preparing you for the last step of your journey towards enlightenment and immortality. "To live forever, my dear friend, you must learn to separate the self from the body," she told you. \n\nNow [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] says that you are ready. It is time to put all her lessons into practice. If you succeed, your body will become an immortal vessel, and eternal life is yours. If you fail... You do not want to think about it. \n\n[eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] has offered you a draught of herbs. "This will make the bonds looser and help you to let go," she told you. "But be careful. If you lose the connection to your body entirely, who knows where your spirit will end up.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21422;You lay down on the bed and close your eyes. Slowly but surely all the impressions and thoughts melt away as you clear your mind. Even the sound of your own breath disappears into nothingness as you sink deeper and deeper... \n\nAnd then, you rise. The body before you is yours, you know this. You have seen the reflection of that face a thousand times, but never like this. It looks peaceful – not even breathing, you realize. This fact does not upset you. Detachedly you observe it for a while before you sink back into your body. \n\nThe first breath is more vivid than anything you ever felt. "Like a newborn baby," [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] says contentedly. "Welcome, my friend, to your new life.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21426;As you lower the flask from your lips a strange feeling comes over you. [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName] helps you to lay down on the bed – your limbs are numb and it is almost impossible to make them obey. You try to speak, but it is as if your tongue belongs to someone else. Your body is melting, dissolving... \n\nAs your body is sinking down into the bedding, your spirit rises, shedding its mortal husk. You know that the body before you used to be your own but now you feel strangely detached from it. You do not belong with this old hunk of flesh anymore. You turn around, and keep rising... \n\nIn another part of the keep, a new life is born. You can feel its pureness, its vitality, the brightness of its life force. A fresh start...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21427;You lay down on the bed and close your eyes. Slowly but surely all the impressions and thoughts melt away as you clear your mind. Even the sound of your own breath disappears into nothingness as you sink deeper and deeper... \n\nAnd then, you rise. The body before you is yours, you know this. You have seen the reflection of that face a thousand times, but never like this. It looks peaceful. You stay like this for a while, observing detachedly. \n\nThen suddenly something rushes through you. For a moment everything feels twisted, wrong. The feeling is gone as soon as it came, but the body before you starts to move. The eyes snap wide open and the lips are parted with a bone-chilling shriek. You try to sink back into the body but you cannot. Something is already there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDSC_RIP_21501_A;[eternal_life_investigator.GetTitledFirstName] joins you after supper one evening. [eternal_life_investigator.GetSheHeCap] initiates a conversation about the status of trade in the realm, but you notice that [eternal_life_investigator.GetSheHe] seems distraught.

EVTDSC_RIP_21503_A;Late one night there is a knock on the door of your study. You open the door to find [eternal_life_investigator.GetTitledFirstName] standing there. [eternal_life_investigator.GetHerHisCap] eyes dart around nervously as [eternal_life_investigator.GetSheHe] requests to be let inside. You make a gesture for [eternal_life_investigator.GetHerHim] to enter and asks [eternal_life_investigator.GetHerHim] to take a seat. \n\n"I have some very disturbing news, [Root.GetEventTarget1Relation]," [eternal_life_investigator.GetSheHe] says as soon as you sit down. "It's about [eternal_life_mystic.GetFirstName]. I've had her followed, and the intelligence my spies have given me is most worrying."
