EVTDESC_77800_A;My magnificent pet owl has finally taken her last breath. Although I have been her guardian for a long time, now when it is time to send her off, I realize that perhaps she has also been watching over me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77800_B;My owl won't wake up. They tell me she has moved on to the next world, but why would she not tell me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77801_A;A servant gasps as I throw myself from the balcony. Wind in my hair, I soar through the air and it feels like it goes on forever. The landing I make is soft - I'm surrounded by hay! A pigeon looks at me skeptically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77801_B;A servant gasps as I step off from the balcony. He does not know I can fly! The air caresses my cheek as I am carried forward by the wind, with incredible speed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77802_A;My magnificent cat curled up in its favorite spot by the window last night. I think now that maybe it knew it did not have long left in this world. At least it went peacefully.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77802_B;They tell me my cat left to visit one of my distant aunts. Apparently, this aunt has a nice house in the country and my cat will be very happy there, roaming the wilderness, playing with a bunch of other cats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77803;The guard nods hesitantly and somewhat sullenly walks away. "Don't argue!" I yell after him, as he disappears down the corridor.\nNow that I think about it, I never smelled any smoke, and later I find a small grave behind the stables!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77851;Lately I have had reasons to believe that [cat_hater.GetFirstName] has less than warm feelings for my feline companion. Today my suspicions were confirmed as [cat_hater.GetSheHe] threw a fit when the cat drank from [cat_hater.GetHerHis] cup! [cat_hater.GetSheHeCap] demands that I get rid of my pet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77852;Today I decided to go and visit my cat at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s residence. When I arrived I found [From.GetHerHim] playing most enthusiastically with the little furball. I watched them for several minutes before I announced myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77852_dog;Today I decided to go and visit my dog at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s residence. When I arrived I found them playing together most enthusiastically. I watched them for several minutes before I announced myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77853;Today I decided to go and visit my cat at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s residence. However, when I arrived, [From.GetSheHe] could not produce the feline. When I angrily demanded to know the truth [From.GetSheHe] admitted to having gotten rid of the cat a few days earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77853_dog;Today I decided to go and visit my dog at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s residence. However, when I arrived, [From.GetSheHe] could not produce the canine. When I angrily demanded to know the truth [From.GetSheHe] admitted to having gotten rid of the dog a few days earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77854;Things have been tense between [cat_hater.GetFirstName] and I since [cat_hater.GetSheHe] threw the tantrum the other today. [cat_hater.GetSheHeCap] has grown more and more irritated. Today it culminated in a harsh ultimatum – I must make a choice between [cat_hater.GetSheHe] and the cat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77856;When it is sleeping or cuddling on my lap, my cat is a precious angel. I do not understand how something can be so calm in one moment, only to fly across the room in the next. When it gets these fits it climbs all over my belongings, and it is only a matter of luck if something does not break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77857_CAT;[rabbit_parent.GetTitledFirstName] angrily bursts into my throne room. Apparently my beloved cat has killed [rabbit_parent.GetHerHis] [rabbit_child.GetSonDaughter]'s pet rabbit. At least that is what [rabbit_parent.GetFirstName] claims. Now [rabbit_parent.GetSheHe] demands some kind of compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77858;I am sitting by the fire with my precious cat curled up in my lap. I pet it slowly as I stare into the flames. My furry friend enjoys a good life here with me, but what about all the other cats who do not have a home? The ones who no one feeds, or combs, or cuddles? Perhaps I can take care of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77860;Your precious cat has the ability of always knowing when you are in need of comfort. Appearing as if out of nowhere only to jump up on your lap and purr softly to your gentle stroking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77861;Your two pets truly fight like cat and dog. You can barely sleep at night unless you lock them in separate rooms. In fear of confinement, your cat has begun hiding before bedtime. Yesterday you spent the better part of an hour looking for it. You cannot stand this much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77862_A;Today, when you were going for a hunt, you couldn't find your loyal canine companion anywhere. As you called its name, the stable master came over and told you that he had seen a cat chase a dog across the courtyard. Now it is nowhere to be found…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77862_B;It is time to go to bed and you are searching for your cat. You attempt your most recent trick, luring it out with small treats from the kitchen, but for the first time the method proves unsuccessful. Once an hour has passed, you give up and call for your dog. It comes running with a limp little body in its maw…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_77862_C;Some time was just what your pets needed. One day they simply stopped fighting and since they have become the best of friends. Now you often find them playing or snoozing together. They really seem much happier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
