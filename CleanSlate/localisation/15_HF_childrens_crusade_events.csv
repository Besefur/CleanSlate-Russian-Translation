EVTDESCAHF25800;I have received a vision from the Holy Ghost.\nOur Lord has ordered me to take up arms, rally the faithful and march on the Holy Land to take it away from the vile grasp of the infidels desecrating its hallowed grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25802;By permanently getting rid of [From.GetFirstName], I have ensured that [From.GetHerHis] misguided attempt to lead a Crusade to the Holy Land will never come to pass. All the children and peasants who had flocked to the banner of this [From.GetBoyGirl] have scattered to the four winds. They lament the loss of their beloved leader, still unable to grasp why would God allow [From.GetHerHim] to meet an untimely end before accomplishing [From.GetHerHis] divine task.\nAs unfortunate as [From.GetFirstName]'s fate was, it has undoubtedly saved the lives of countless people, who would have otherwise followed the child into the maws of certain doom at the hands of the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25804;By capturing [From.GetFirstName], I have put a stop to [From.GetHerHis] misguided attempt to lead a Crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nThe child languished in my dungeons, and [From.GetHerHis] foolish followers have already started to scatter to the four winds, unable to fathom why God would allow their beloved leader to be stopped so easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25805;With the untimely capture of [From.GetFirstName] by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the [From.GetBoyGirl]'s attempt to lead a horde of zealots to recapture the Holy Land for Christendom has been foiled. The child's followers have swiftly scattered to the four winds after the loss of their beloved leader, unable to comprehend why God would allow [From.GetFirstName] to be stopped so easily before succeeding in [From.GetHerHis] divine quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25806;Something has happened to my beloved [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName].\n\n[From.GetSheHeCap] claims that the Holy Ghost visited [From.GetHerHim] last night, ordering [From.GetHerHim] to take up arms, gather all the true followers and lead a Crusade against the infidels who are desecrating the hallowed soil of Jerusalem.\n\n[From.GetSheHeCap] has even had the gall to demand money, weapons and troops from me to show my support to this sacred quest of [From.GetHersHis]. [From.GetSheHeCap] will not listen to reason and is very determined to leave [Root.Capital.GetName] immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25807;News have reached us that a [FromFrom.GetBoyGirl] from [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] has received a vision from the Holy Ghost, compelling [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to pick up arms, gather the true followers of Christ and lead a Crusade against the infidels who desecrate the sacred soil of Jerusalem.\nThe [FromFrom.GetBoyGirl] has gathered many followers amongst the peasantry and has embarked on great journey to reach the Holy Land, claiming that the sea itself will open at [FromFrom.GetHerHis] passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25810;The ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName]. As if the parade of dirty peasants and screeching children hadn't already caused enough problems, their unlikely leader has requested an audience with me, claiming that I should provide supplies and lodging for [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHis] holy warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25811;The ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName]. As if the parade of dirty peasants and screeching children hadn't already caused enough problems, their unlikely leader has requested an audience with me, claiming that I should provide troops and armaments for [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHis] holy quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25812;Ever since the ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName], I have received no shortage of complaints from [child_outraged_priest.GetTitledFirstName] regarding how heretical this Crusade is, and how I should make an example of its young leader to prevent my subjects from falling to [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHis] sinful words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25813;Ever since the ragtag army of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName] has reached [Root.Capital.GetName], I felt drawn to the words of its leader. Jesus surely speaks for [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25814;Tragedy has struck me! My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], swayed by the words of [childrens_crusade_leader.GetFirstName], has decided to flee [From.GetHerHis] home to join the Children's Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25815;[From.GetFirstName] claimed that the tides of the Mediterranean Sea would split open at the arrival of [From.GetHerHis] army, allowing [From.GetHerHis] warriors to cross unscathed and march all the way to the Holy Land.\nUnfortunately, the Lord did not fulfill the promise made to the young Crusader, and now the large force of peasants and children languishes in Genoa, looking for a way to travel to Asia.\nSome of the less determined members of the Crusade have already lost their faith, but [From.GetFirstName] remains strong in [From.GetHerHis] conviction, persuading new, hopeless recruits every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25816;After having finally managed to book a passage through the Mediterranean Sea in order to reach the Holy Land, the Children's Crusade has been forced to an unfortunate detour to Greece after their ships crashed on the coasts of Achaia after a terrible storm. Reports from the army are scant, although there are rumors saying that many have started to doubt [From.GetFirstName]'s leadership. \n\nAnd yet, this unlikely horde of youths and peasants is still marching on towards Jerusalem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25817;Despite all adversities and many attempts to undermine [From.GetHerHis] divinely-inspired leadership, [From.GetFirstName] has been able to march [From.GetHerHis] army all the way to Nikaea. \nWith the Holy Land finally within reach, the Crusaders' resolve has been strengthened. Their leader is certain that the infidels will not dare to raise their arms against them once they realize their holy mandate, and instead will open the doors of Jerusalem at their very arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25818;After receiving a vision of the Archangel Gabriel, who helped [From.GetHerHim] lead [From.GetHerHis] army through the treacherous path leading to Outremer, the children of [From.GetFirstName] have miraculously managed to reach Antioch before being spotted by the infidels.\nIn spite of the [From.GetBoyGirl]'s claim that the infidels would forsake the Devil upon their very arrival without the need for a fight, the heathens occupying Jerusalem have begun mobilizing their army, ready and eager to slaughter the innocent souls marching against them, in order to protect their ill-gotten land.\nThe world will soon see whether [From.GetFirstName] was truly blessed by the Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25819;It appears that whatever impetus had driven so many to follow [From.GetFirstName] has dissipated. The Children's Crusade is no more, its army scattered and broken, its main supporters dead or missing.\nThe leader [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName], still convinced to be the messenger of the Lord, is now derided by most as a raving lunatic who spends most of [From.GetHerHis] days yelling at people from street corners, lamenting about the depravity of the Church and the nearing end of our world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25823;Facing against the concrete threat of a heathen army, the Children's Crusade shattered in a thousand crying pieces.\nWithout proper leadership, equipment, or trained soldiers, [From.GetFirstName] was unable to stand against [From.GetHerHis] foes. Despite being able to lead [From.GetHerHis] followers all the way to the Holy Land, [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a Christian Jerusalem will go unfulfilled.\nAbandoned by most of [From.GetHerHis] supporters, the [From.GetBoyGirl] has been sold into slavery, alongside many other children captured by the infidels after their defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25824;An insane child, clearly under the influence of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], has managed to reach Jerusalem at the head of a large army of beggars and youths, claiming that it is [From.GetHerHis] sacred duty to retake the Holy Land in the name of [From.GetHerHis] god.\nWhile the number of gullible fools who have fallen for this [From.GetBoyGirl]'s words is alarming, the idea that a mob of starving peasants will be capable of defeating a mighty [Root.Religion.GetName] army in open battle is laughable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25825;Facing against the concrete threat of a heathen army, the Children's Crusade shattered in a thousand crying pieces.\nWithout proper leadership, equipment, or trained soldiers, [From.GetFirstName] was unable to stand against [From.GetHerHis] foes. Despite being able to lead [From.GetHerHis] followers all the way to the Holy Land, [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a Christian Jerusalem will go unfulfilled.\nThe heathens slaughtered all of the adults who were foolish enough to follow [From.GetHerHim] and captured the children in the army, selling all of them as slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25826;As was expected, the fools who entrusted their lives in the hands of a child were promptly slaughtered by the armies of the faithful.\nThis Crusade against Jerusalem was bound to be short-lived and one-sided. Our enemies had no skilled commanders, no weapons, no armors, no siege engines, no food... That they were able to reach their destination in the first place was something of a miracle by itself.\nThe few survivors amongst the children have been sold into slavery, never to return to their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25827;Against all odds, the children of Christ have succeeded in their misbegotten quest to reconquer Jerusalem! \nHosts of archangels with shining armor and flaming swords have been reported to have descended upon the walls of the holy city during the final battle, smiting the infidels, turning the defenders' weapons into rust and melting their eyes out.\nA child now rules over the Kingdom of Heaven, and few doubt that it was through divine intervention that [From.GetSheHe] was put there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25802;I feared that my [GetFromRelation]'s desire to free the Holy Land would lead [From.GetHerHim] to an unfortunate end.\n[From.GetFirstName] is gone. All the children and peasants who had flocked to [From.GetHerHis] banner have scattered to the four winds. They lament the loss of their beloved leader, still unable to grasp why would God allow [From.GetHerHim] to be killed before accomplishing [From.GetHerHis] divine task.\nYet, I can at least take the solace in the fact that, as unfortunate as [From.GetFirstName]'s death was, it has undoubtedly saved the lives of countless people, who would have otherwise followed the child into the maws of certain doom at the hands of the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25806;[From.GetFirstName], a child from [Root.Capital.GetName] has caused quite the commotion today, when [From.GetSheHe] demanded an audience with me, claiming that the Holy Ghost appeared to [From.GetHerHim] in dream last night, ordering [From.GetHerHim] to take up arms, gather all the true followers of Christ and lead a Crusade to free the Holy Land.\n\n[From.GetSheHeCap] concluded [From.GetHerHis] sermon by commanding me to provide [From.GetHerHim] with money, weapons and men to help [From.GetHerHim] fight against the infidels in the name of Our Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25817;Despite all adversities and many attempts to undermine [From.GetHerHis] divinely-inspired leadership, [From.GetFirstName] has been able to march [From.GetHerHis] army all the way to Nikaea. \nWith the Holy Land finally within reach, the Crusaders' resolve has been strengthened. \n[From.GetFirstName] has sent me a message, thanking me for my continued support during the campaign, and asking me any further help I am able to provide [From.GetHerHim] with in order to prevail against the infidels. With my help and God's blessing, [From.GetSheHe] is certain of victory against the abominable heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25818;After receiving a vision of the Archangel Gabriel, who helped [From.GetHerHim] lead [From.GetHerHis] army through the treacherous path leading to Outremer, the children of [From.GetFirstName] have miraculously managed to reach Antioch before being spotted by the infidels.\nIn spite of the [From.GetBoyGirl]'s claim that the infidels would forsake the Devil upon their very arrival without the need for a fight, the heathens occupying Jerusalem have begun mobilizing their army, ready and eager to slaughter the innocent souls marching against them.\nThe world will soon see whether [From.GetFirstName] was truly blessed by the Lord, or if I was unwise to put my trust in this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25802;With the death of [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] misguided attempt to lead a Crusade to the Holy Land will never come to pass. All the children and peasants who had flocked to the banner of this [From.GetBoyGirl] have scattered to the four winds. They lament the loss of their beloved leader, still unable to grasp why would God allow [From.GetHerHim] to be killed before accomplishing [From.GetHerHis] divine task.\nAs unfortunate as [From.GetFirstName]'s death was, it has undoubtedly saved the lives of countless people, who would have otherwise followed the child into the maws of certain doom at the hands of the infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHF25806_A;If this is what you desire, I will not hold you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25806_B;Do whatever you wish, it is of no concern to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25811;I am afraid we have no men to spare on hopeless quests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25812;Let us not concern ourselves with them, shall we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25800;I must depart at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25802;Such a violent end, for such a young [From.GetBoyGirl]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25804;[From.GetSheHeCap] will stay locked until [From.GetSheHe] has learned [From.GetHerHis] lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25805;Maybe it's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25806;You will have my full support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25807;Such a wild imagination, even for a child...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25810;Your words have moved me! I will support you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25811;I will do much more than that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25812;But [childrens_crusade_leader.GetSheHe] is the chosen of Our Lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25813;I must join [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814;I must follow them to protect my [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_A;Will I ever seem [From.GetHerHim] again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_B;How could [From.GetSheHe] do this to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25814_C;I have a [GetFromRelation]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25815;They could use more troops for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25816;They are surely in need of more supplies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25817;When the time comes, I will join in battle with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25818;[From.GetSheHeCap] does not stand alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25819;And [From.GetSheHe] showed such promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25823;A sad yet inevitable fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25824;We will slaughter them like lambs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25825;Such a tragic yet predictable end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25826;There could be no other end to this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25827;I can no longer deny it! God is with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25828;I wish for [From.GetHerHis] reign to be long and prosperous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25806;I will dispatch some men to protect you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25807;May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] show [childrens_crusade_leader.GetHerHim] the way to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25810;Take some food and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25811;Very well, I will grant you some of my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25813;But wars are too scary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25815;I will allocate some resources to help them buy a passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25816;I must reiterate my support to strengthen [From.GetFirstName]'s authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25817;I will allocate more resources to support your fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25818;[From.GetFirstName] will not fight this Crusade alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25819;It was bound to happen sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25827;This is impossible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25828;I always believed in [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF25806;I will give you some food for the travel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25807;Could this child be a messenger of the Lord?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25810;Oh, I will find you a place to stay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25811;You can see if any of my subjects are interested in your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25815;I can spare some money to send them some food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25816;I will dispatch letters to the local authorities to send them on the correct path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25817;I can only offer you my most sincere prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25818;My prayers go with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25828;God was with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF25806;Oh, absolutely! I will ship you to the holy land myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25810;Guards! Remove these urchins from the premises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25811;Do not worry, I know just who to call...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25812;Worry not, [child_outraged_priest.GetFirstName]. I will make these pesky children disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25815;I will pray that they soon find a passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25816;I can only hope they will persevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25817;There is not much else I can do, I fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25818;Those poor, foolish souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25828;Wha-? How..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF25806_A;You are dead to me. Leave and never return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25806_B;Guards! Throw this blithering fools out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25810;I am afraid we have no food to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25811;What sort of joke is this? Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25812;I will have my guards beat them out of [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25815;They are still in time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25816;Perhaps the Lord does not wish them to reach the Holy Land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25817;How are they still going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
