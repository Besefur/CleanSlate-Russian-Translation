chinese_imperial_government;Chinese Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chinese_imperial_government_desc;Chinese Imperialism, much like the ordinary Feudal government, revolves around vassals owing fealty to their liege. It is inspired by the efficient administration of the mainland [offmap_china.GetFullName], and promotes peaceful dialog over religious differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

confucian_bureaucracy;Confucian Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
confucian_bureaucracy_desc;Confucian Bureaucracies rely on a set of strict imperial examinations to select their rulers. Candidates are tested on their knowledge of the Confucian Classics - though merit, previous achievements and recommendations from prominent aristocrats also play a major role in the selection process. Rulers tend to be very skilled stewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
feudal_government;Feudal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
feudal_government_desc;Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, and Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... There are several Succession Laws to pick between - each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have. If you should convert to a religion in the [muslim.GetGroupName] group, your government form will change to Iqta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merchant_republic_government;Merchant Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merchant_republic_government_desc;Playing as a Patrician within a Merchant Republic is not entirely dissimilar from playing a Feudal lord - you are still after more Holdings, and you need an heir of your family. However, leadership of the Republic changes between the five major Patrician families through special elections. Patricians can also build a network of Trade Posts, even in the counties of other powers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_feudal_government;Iqta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
muslim_feudal_government_desc;The [arabic.GetGroupName] Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals of varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Open' type, where the son with most land inherits. If you should convert to a non-[muslim.GetGroupName] religion, your government form will change to Feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nomadic_government;Nomadic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nomadic_government_desc;Nomads are not very interested in owning Holdings, only in more grazing land for their sheep and horses. Gameplay centers around the Population of the tribe and the Manpower it provides. Empty Holdings slots in open terrain increases the maximum population. While Nomads can have normal vassals, they are mostly concerned with managing the other, few but powerful, major Clans of the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

order_government;Holy Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
order_government_desc;The most pious followers of their religion might join Holy Orders in an attempt to defend the faith from outside forces. Coming to the defense of any Lord or Lady who might be attacked by infidels, they are the stalwart protectors of the faithful. These orders have strict hierarchies, passing from one leader to the next within the order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
republic_government;Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
republic_government_desc;The leaders of regular republics are randomly chosen from among the citizenry. This kind of republic is not playable, since there is no dynastic persistence between the generations of rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_imperial_government;Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_imperial_government_desc;An Imperial government differs from its feudal counterpart by placing a larger focus on urban areas and a centralized court whose influence deeply affects internal politics.

monastic_feudal_government;Monastic Feudal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monastic_feudal_government_desc;The Monastic Feudal government, much like the ordinary Feudal government, revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, and Monastic Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... The Monastic Feudal government is unique to [tibetan_group.GetGroupName] of either the [buddhist.GetName] or [bon_pagan.GetName] faiths, and allows holding Temples in addition to Castles. Monastic Feudal rulers can also construct Gompa Monastery buildings in Castle holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribal_government;Tribal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribal_government_desc;Tribes are settled, but agrarian. Each County can only have one Tribal 'Holding', representing the entire local tribal population - the more empty Holding slots, the more powerful the Tribal Holding. Tribal rulers are most often seen using the 'Elective Gavelkind' Succession Law, which tends to fragment the realm between sons on the death of the chief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribal_governments_FEATURES;§Y*§! Can reform to Feudal, Iqta and Merchant Republic governments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
