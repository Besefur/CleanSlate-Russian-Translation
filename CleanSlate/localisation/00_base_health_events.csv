EVTDESC6000;A strange, reddish-pink rash appeared on my palms and soles not long ago along with a fever and headache. Some parts of the rash has developed abscesses and is both ugly and itchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6001;The rash disappeared and took the headache and fever with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6010;First I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes, then my nose deformed. People fear me and I must hide my face as to not cause hysteria among others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6011;A man approached me and I tried to duck away from him, not let him see my disfigurement. He told me he had a cure and sold me a potion for only 25 gold coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020;The voices in my head are telling me to do horrible things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020_COMA;I awoke from my unending nightmare screaming. I have been in the abyss, an indescribable darkness. How long have I been asleep? Weeks, years?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020_FEVER;The fever has broken - perhaps only temporarily - but I can still see the shadowy figures lurking in the corners. Are they real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020_PARA;They are all watching me, conspiring... even my closest friends. Dark eyes, cold eyes... evil eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020_PRISON;There are things in the walls. Things... Not rats, oh no! Not vermin at all... but scratching, watching, trying to drive me insane!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020_ZEAL;The dark stain of heresy has infected everyone around me. [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] is winning the war for humanity's souls. No one is pure... except me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6021;I was later told that my strange behavior and fear of the moon was caused by the voices in my head. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] managed to clear my head of voices and now I have total silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6030;I am speaking in tongues, screaming obscenities at random times, most often when the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] preaches and am sometimes lying on the ground writhing in apparent pain. I seldom remember these things and people believe me to be possessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6030_MUS;I am speaking in tongues, screaming obscenities at random times, most often when the imam is talking and am sometimes lying on the ground writhing in apparent pain. I seldom remember these things and people believe me to be possessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6031;Vade retro satana!'\n\nThe priest's exorcism worked beautifully, I haven't spoken in tongues or screamed obscenities for several days!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6031_ALL;As the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] slowly pulled me out of the holy spring, the water started boiling and frothing, paint running off the arcane runes smeared on my naked body. Filled with wonder, I realized that the gibbering voices in my head had finally fallen silent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6031_MUS;By reciting The Throne Verse from the Qur'an and invoking Allah's help the imam managed to repair the damage in me caused by sihr or witchcraft. To be on the safe side, we also recited together the three last suras from the Qur'an: Surat al-Ikhlas (The Fidelity), Surat al-Falaq (The Dawn) and Surat al-Nas (Mankind).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6040;My moodiness and tendency to lash out at people is getting worse. I sleep too little and can't seem to stop worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6041;The world will not weigh me down anymore, I have a new spring in my step, joy in my heart and a smile on my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6050;I find myself lying in bed all day, the act of getting up almost as difficult as that of ruling. Food tastes bland, and my time spent with friends doesn't bring the joy it once did. I don't really understand why, but I hate my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6051;After a couple of days just spending some time doing things I love, hunting, reading and visiting friends, life does not seem as grey as it did before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6060;I don't feel too well, something is wrong with me. I am burning up with fever, my nose is running and my head feels as if someone is banging something hard against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6061;I woke this morning feeling much better. It seems that my illness has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6062;Nana says I am not sick anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6070;This cough is killing me! It started as chest pain and shortness of breath, then I started coughing up phlegm and now blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6071;The cough disappeared, thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! I still feel a bit weak but the coughing, the chest pain and the shortness of breath are gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6080;When the hot cautery touched the open wound, I couldn't hold the scream back. I cursed the doctor who only laughed, told me to take it easy and not pick on the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6081;The old wound has finally healed, leaving a pretty grotesque scar behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6082;An old wound is aggravating and painful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6100;My body may be sapless and infirm, but my mind is as healthy as ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6110;Where am I? Who are these people? Oh, pretty colors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6111;I haven't coughed for days and the pain is gone. Fate has granted me reprieve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6112;I feel weak as a babe, but the cursed fever has finally broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6113;The spots are receding and the fever has broken. Am I really cured?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6114;I am alive... I AM ALIVE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6115;It takes more to kill me than measly measles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6116;I think I made it through this cursed disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6200;This voice calling to me, telling me I was a bad person, telling me how evil I was. I realized that this was no ordinary voice, this was Jesus Christ, our Lord and saviour himself. I knew that I would have to live a better life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6201;Jesus Christ our Lord has commanded me to give more to the poor. I cannot ignore his calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6202;My sin is too great so I must show repentance. I care not what others think Heaven is only for the truly repentant. I will don the cilice to show the depth of my repentance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6203;I saw a hairy star in the sky, I swear it to be true. 'Twas the color of blood I tell thee. It was if the Lord God himself was bleeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6204;For too long I have pandered to my lustful yearning, Jesus tells me it is a mortal sin, I must stop it now. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6205;The life of virtuous is not easy, but Jesus commands me to resist the carnal urges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6206;I hear him admonish me, I should not be eating for the sole motive of sensual gratification. I must stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6207;The road to heaven is hard and demanding. Jesus tells me I must be self controlled and disciplined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6208;I try to justify it to him, but I know I lie not just to him, but to myself. I condemned things eternal for the sake of temporal things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6209;I feel the love of God infuse my soul. Jesus tells me it is only way to truly glorify God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6210;There was a Lion without, I though I would be slain in the Streets, but then the Lion said unto me let go your slothful ways and I realized who the Lion was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6211;I hear him whispering to me, that it is for me to glory God, not to leave it unto others. I shall do thus and be more diligent in my tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6212;My neighbor has quite probably the finest ass around, but then Jesus whispered to me that this was wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6213;For too long I have felt incomplete, that my spirit was somehow lacking. Then the voice reminded me that the true fruit of the spirit was kindness. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6214;For too long I have directed my anger towards those who dimply do not deserve it. Jesus whispered to me and reminded me that I should direct it those who had sinned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6215;I have been so quick to judge, I realize it now. The voice reminds me that I should seek what is good for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6216;I am proud and I thought myself noble for I rejected all that was weak and insipid. Then the voice reminded me that I was rejecting God when I worshipped myself thus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6217;For too long I believed that it was the Greeks who would inherit the earth. Then Jesus whispered that is was simply a typo in my Bible and that in reality it was the meek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6218;Jesus whispers have become more frantic of late. He is worried that Satan has corrupted his words through his agents at the various ecumenical councils. He has asked me to seek out the good news that Philip brought so that I can understand the true role of Mary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6219;For too long I have felt powerless as our enemies advance, but lately Jesus has been promising me victories if only I can get command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6220;Lately Jesus has fallen silent over military matters. I feel somehow lessened because without the Lord who am I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6221;I felt the holy spirit fill me and just like the Apostles of yore I could speak in the tongues of many peoples, as the holy spirit gave me the power to express myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6222;The holy spirit left me and I felt lessened. Some cynics commented that I was finally sober, but they did not understand what the true love of the Lord felt like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6223;I had been hearing a voice for some time now but I couldn't quite place it. Then I felt its presence fill me and it did not feel divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6224;I wasn't sure what to do, when [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] himself whispered to me. I should talk to one of the denizens of my dungeon.  As I listened to the prisoner's appeal for mercy Satan whispered to me once more that they weren't very sincere. Perchance a little time on the rack would help him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6225;He came to me while I slept, it seemed almost as if it was a dream. He had three heads, the body of a man, the legs of a cock and the tail of a serpent. He taught me something about myself that I had always known but denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6226;As I sat and looked at the fish course, the fish spoke to me and reminded me that my neighbor's titles were rich and should be mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6227;Asmodeus asked me why I was denying myself sensual pleasures. I told him it was sin and he reminded me that the Lord God himself had commanded that we should go forth and multiply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6228;I told Asmodeus that lust is a sin against God, and he whispered quietly that I am made in God's image. If I have these urges then it is only because God does too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6229;I was patient and listened to the knight as he explained to me why the world was shaped like a banana. I knew it was Satan's voice who said why do you listen to this fool, your eyes prove the world is flat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6230;The servant dropped the meat and the dogs immediately drove upon it. The waste angered me but I held my temper, then the voice whispered to me as it has so often before: 'Why do you accept this foolishness?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6231;At the sermon the father reminded the congregation of my humbleness. Then a voice whispered in my ear, I know it is the morning star, and he told me that the father was making a fool out of me. The so called priest was a wealthy man who ate well while the poor starved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6232;I sat in contemplation of my life and wondered why it was that I wasn't getting my due. Then a voice whispered to me, I know it to be Lucifer, who told me it was my right to have a throne higher than the clouds and over the earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6233;I always tried to avoid eating too much, as I felt it a sin. The Lord of the flies whispered softly in my ear, that I should enjoy all the fruits of God's creation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6234;I looked upon  the table and my mouth salivated at the rich odours. I felt the urge to fill my plate as much as I could and the Beelzebub whispered why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6235;As I watched the Almoner hand out coins I wondered is it really so good that those who are clearly going to squander the money should receive it. Mammon came to me later and pointed out the logic in my thoughts, we should try to save first those who can be saved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6236;It was hard to sleep, while Mammon softly whispered in my ear. He was telling me about all the things that should be mine but  others had The more he whispered the more it made sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6237;It was the Leviathan who told me that I was merely being weak. I should stop it and show my strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6238;The Leviathan whispered to me and reminded me that there were those who had that did not deserve it and then there were those like me who deserved so much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6239;Belphegor was wondering why I was always so busy. I am top of the tree, compared to the serfs, so why should I not take the time to enjoy it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6240;I often wondered why I bother about such trivial things. Belphegor keeps urging me to save my energy for when it really matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6300;You have decided to introduce a new law to the good people of the realm, as is your right as their ruler. Now you just have to decide on its contents...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6301;Your slightly eccentric liege has proclaimed a new law that is to be upheld throughout the realm. It reads:\n\n"Whereas the turnip represents the very best qualities to be found in society, and: whereas it is of fine texture, particularly when boiled, and has been proven to remedy all ailments known to Man when consumed:\n\nTherefore I, [From.GetTitledName], decree that the turnip shall henceforth be used as currency throughout the realm, taking the place of gold, silver or any other precious metal. These shall instead be turned over to the Crown for immediate disposal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6302;Your slightly eccentric liege has proclaimed a new law that is to be upheld throughout the realm. It reads:\n\n"Whereas pants constrict not only the lower limbs and reproductive organs, but also the human soul, and: whereas pants are known to be an affront to all forms of life but Man:\n\nTherefore I, [From.GetTitledName], command that the use of pants be outlawed throughout the realm under penalty of death. All existing variants of this garment are to be immediately burned, and the ashes distributed evenly over the graves of our forefathers.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6303;Your slightly eccentric liege has proclaimed a new law that is to be upheld throughout the realm. It reads:\n\n"Whereas the positive effects of fresh air is known to all, and: whereas the movement of the wind must not be obstructed by man-made structures:\n\nTherefore I, [From.GetTitledName], decree that all homesteads throughout the realm are to have two holes, each no smaller than a grown peasant standing with arms outstretched, in opposite walls facing each other to allow free passage of the wind. These holes are not to be covered by planks, windows, doors or cattle. If any member of the household is known to exhibit severe flatulence, the holes shall number three and no less.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6304;Your slightly eccentric liege has proclaimed a new law that is to be upheld throughout the realm. It reads:\n\n"Whereas the children of the realm have become desensitised to violence, and: whereas the general populace seems to have lost all regard for the sanctity of human life:\n\nTherefore I, [From.GetTitledName], decree that all forms of violence directed at other human beings be outlawed, including both capital and corporal punishment as well as the torture of criminals, heathens and foreigners. These vulnerable social groups are instead to be rehabilitated and eventually released back into society as productive citizens.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6305;The new law has been written and couriers are even now distributing it to all of your vassals. You admire your handiwork:\n\n"Whereas the turnip represents the very best qualities to be found in society, and: whereas it is of fine texture, particularly when boiled, and has been proven to remedy all ailments known to Man when consumed:\n\nTherefore I, [Root.GetTitledName], decree that the turnip shall henceforth be used as currency throughout the realm, taking the place of gold, silver or any other precious metal.

These vulnerable social groups are instead to be rehabilitated and eventually released back into society as productive citizens.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6315;You are sitting on the floor of your bedchamber, wearing one of your shoes as a hat, when suddenly a man-sized gopher enters the room. It is dressed as a maid and when you shout in alarm, the rodent squeaks and skitters away in panic. You chase it down the hall but find only a terrified maid cowering on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6316;You are hosting a dinner for some local dignitaries when the full moon comes into view in one of the windows. Trembling, you excuse yourself and hurry up the stairs to your bedchamber while stripping off your clothes. You are completely naked when the guards find you crouched on your balcony, howling at the moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6317;Your horse has always struck you as being of a dependable sort, a quality you feel is sorely lacking in your councillors. Time to shake things up a bit. You will appoint him as your new [Root.GetChancellorName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6318;Your mad [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has decided, in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] infinite wisdom, to relieve you of your post as [Root.Liege.GetChancellorName]. Glitterhoof, [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] beloved horse, will be taking your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6350;As I was lying in my bed at night I was suddenly woken by the hissing and growling of my favorite cat. The bedchamber was alive with scratching, scurrying noises, coming from the very walls themselves. I sprang from the bed, but the noises suddenly disappeared and a subsquent investigation of the chamber revealed nothing but patched stone walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6351;The servant I had sent to fetch water never returned and when I went to investigate I noticed a strange light emanating from the well. I peered inside and saw a color like no color I had ever seen before. It was like smoke, cold and wet but burning my skin where it touched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6352;I had repeatedly questioned my servant about the locked mausoleum beneath the castle but it wasn't until today that I found the key, hidden inside a rotting chest in the oldest castle tower. Inside the tomb's dusty passageways I found an empty stone coffin which bore the inscription '[Root.GetFirstName] [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6353;An old cottar and his wife who were known for their cruelty to cats were found dead in their home this morning, their bones picked clean of meat. My steward tells me that the local townspeople had their cats go missing the day before, but all the missing cats returned today looking fat and happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6354;Since the incident some weeks ago I have felt uneasy. I took a walk along the coast to clear my mind and found a small village where the people claimed to worship the 'Old Ones', Gods older than even those of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. They invited me to join in their rituals and showed me a dusty old grimoire written by a mad Saracen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6355;Intense study of the grimoire has gained me much knowledge. I have devised a ritual to awaken the most powerful of the Old Ones where he sleeps, dead but dreaming, in his watery tomb beneath the ocean. The cult has prepared the ritual attire and is gathering the necessary sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6356;The cult has gathered for the ritual on the shore of a black and stormy sea. The chanting begins, Ph'nglui mglw'nafh..., and in the depths of the dark waters something stirs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6357;I steered the longboat through the raging waters towards the monstrous creature. It stood as tall as a castle tower, with the body of a man and the head of a great tentacled beast. I knew that I had awoken it from where it slept beneath the waves and that it was here to end the age of man. There was only one thing I could do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6358;I awoke in my own bed weak and sweating. The servants told me that they had found me on the shore, naked and half-drowned. I asked them about the creature and the ship but they just looked at me with worried eyes and shook their heads. It seems I am the only living witness to these events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6360;A loud sneeze interrupts [Root.GetMyMarshalName] [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName]'s speech on the importance of camp hygiene. 'I am sorry, my [Root.GetLordLady],' mutters [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName], the [Root.GetSpymasterName], casting a quick glance at the cat on my lap. 'If you could only leave the creature out of our meetings, this would not happen again, I swear.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6361;I am awoken by a soft pat on my cheek. 'Oh, Mittens. Are you having trouble falling asleep?' She jumps down from my bed and starts pawing at the door. 'Let's go to the kitchen and get you some warm milk.' But as I close my bedroom door behind me, Mittens heads in the opposite direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6362;As I round a corner, I spot Mittens' fluffy tail as she squeezes through the chamber door of my [Root.GetSpymasterName], [Root.job_spymaster.GetFullName]! I enter, finding Mittens curled up on [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHis] chest, licking [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHis] face, but [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] does not react. The [Root.job_spymaster.GetManWoman] before me is completely still, not even breathing, and [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHis] face is strangely swollen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6363;Apparently, it was not bad enough when that stupid animal glared at us from the saftey of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s lap. Now it has its own chair, and a seat on the council, to boot! The [FromFrom.GetTitle] has informed us that the former [FromFrom.GetSpymasterName] was poisoned, but a servant who helped move the body insist that the [FromFrom.GetSpymasterName] was suffocated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6365;[From.GetSheHeCap] is so cute and fluffy, what would life even be like if I were to lose [From.GetHerHim]? I am not sure I could go on... I must do something about this and protect my beloved cat [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA6000;What is wrong with me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6001;I feel much better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6010;My face! My pretty face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6011;The potion worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020;I can't defy them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020_COMA;The darkness... it's still here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020_FEVER;Who are they?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020_PARA;What do they want?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020_PRISON;I must get out of this hellhole!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6020_ZEAL;They must all be cleansed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6021;IT'S TOO QUIET!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6030;Begone, foul demon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6030_MUS;Begone, foul djinn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6031;Vade retro satana!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6031_ALL;Once again, to be on the safe side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6040;This is a lot of pressure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6041;Life isn't too bad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6050;I really do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6051;I feel better now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6060;Please kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6061;Alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6062;I can run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6070;Something is very wrong with me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6071;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6080;Why I oughta...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6081;Ewww...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6082;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6100;Who are you? Oh, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6110;So tired... zzz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6111;O Fortuna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6112;I could eat a horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6113;The fates are kind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6114;HAHA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6115;Time to get up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6116;Poxy no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6200;Jesus calls to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6201;The Lord wills it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6202;For my soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6203;It's an omen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6204;I will control my vices;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6205;And so I shall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6206;I will stop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6207;I will be ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6208;God forgive me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6209;Praise to God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6210;I will do as I was commanded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6212;Jesus is right, this is wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6213;I will be more kind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6214;I will be a true soldier of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6215;I will do so;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6216;Then I realized how wrong I was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6217;Then I will be more meek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6218;I will do as our Lord Commands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6219;As Jesus Wills;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6220;It must be a punishment for my sins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6221;The only problem is no one else can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6222;I am saddened. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6223;Redrum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6224;I heard him scream and [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] laughed with delight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6225;It is wrong, but feels right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6226;A messenger from my Lord the Leviathan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6227;It was the word of God?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6228;God must want me to do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6229;He's right you know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6230;Yes I will not be weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6231;My eyes are open;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6232;He is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6233;He tells it true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6234;Indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6235;It is right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6236;They will be mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6237;I will be strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6238;I never thought of it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA6239;You know he has a point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
