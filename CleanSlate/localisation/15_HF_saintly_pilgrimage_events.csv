EVTDESC_HF_41370;A loud roar, and suddenly there is a huge furry creature just down the road. A bear? Now? Here? This must be a creature sent by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] to test me and my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_41411;I open the door, and there is a huge bloody altar and dark clad people filling the room.

EVTDESC_HF_41412;The dark priest explains the ritual, which includes all of us being burnt down with the unholy church. After the church has burnt down, we will all be reborn with the old one and destroy the world as it exists right now, and reshape it in our image.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
