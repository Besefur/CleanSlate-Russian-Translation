EVTDESC88250;A messenger arrives with an invitation to all the warriors of the land to take part in Furusiyya, a great martial competition held but once per reign to determine who is the greatest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88251;The Furusiyya begins and the coming two months shall separate those gifted with the skills of a warrior from those who would only pretend at such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88252;The Furusiyya has come to an end and the stories of its great heroes and their unfortunate victims are already spreading throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88253;The Furusiyya has ended, and though I was bested by some participants, I also saw victory more than once. The promise I show as a warrior cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88254;The Furusiyya has ended and my martial prowess is no longer considered idle boasting - it is proven fact. Though there were a handful of warriors gifted with skills superior to my own, the glory I won is enough to make me a hero in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88255;The Furusiyya has reached its end and not a moment too soon. My performance left much to be desired, and I would have suffered worse if some of my opponents had not pitied me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88256;The Furusiyya has ended and though I did make a name for myself, it was not the one I had hoped for. I lost to every challenger, and when I pushed through the crowds and fled in panic in the last wrestling duel, I could hear laughter behind me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88257;The end of the Furusiyya has come, and I have learned much from the skilled warriors who attended. Both my swordsmanship and archery have improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88258;The Furusiyya has reached its end, and the combat techniques I had practised did not work well against real, thinking opponents. I am not quite the fighter I thought I was...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88259;As my opponent skillfully plunged his blade into my belly and I fell on my back, I reflected briefly on the unfairness of the universe. Then I focused on my fading heartbeat as the blue sky above turned darker and darker...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88260;My horse bucked wildly to the side as my opponent rushed past on his camel, and I was thrown to the ground. When my senses returned, I noticed my arm was bent at a strange angle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88261;I was facing an opponent in a game of chess, and while pondering my opening moves, the game next to ours turned violent. One of the players hurled the board aside to pull out his scimitar, sending chess pieces flying everywhere. One of White's Bishops struck me in the eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88262;To my great shame, the challenge of keeping my bowels in check during the martial competition proved too much for me. I fled home to escape the taunts of my former comrades and for a change of underwear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88263;Suddenly, in the middle of a frenzied melee, the crowds part to reveal a giant swordsman grinning at you. After he shows off some fancy moves with his sword, the crowds turn expectantly to you. You fling a dagger into the thug's throat and he drops dead to the wild cheers of those nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88264;There were many who doubted my fighting ability, but when we rode our horses into mock battle only to be ambushed by our opponents, I was the one who led us to victory against all odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88265;As we rode our horses into battle in yet another test of skill, I devised a clever ambush against our opponents. We prevailed despite being outnumbered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88266;Many believe that chess is the ultimate test of strategy, and if this is true, your brilliance as a general is undeniable. All who have mustered the courage to challenge you in this game have met with defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88267;You are renowned for your skills in strategy and planning, but several defeats in mock battles due to embarrassing mistakes on your part have put this reputation into question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88268;No matter how hard you try, you cannot wrap your head around this stupid game called chess. Your opponents always seem to be several moves ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88269;After repeatedly falling off my horse during a competitive event, many have questioned my abilities as a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88270;I have emerged from the Furusiyya as the finest warrior of the land. I have bested all challengers, and my skills at archery and horsemanship have proved second to none.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88271;I have been declared the second champion of the Furusiyya. Few are those who can match my martial prowess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88272;I have been named third champion of the Furusiyya. My efforts in these competitions have proved that I belong in a small circle of elite warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88273;Though I did not participate myself, I felt particularly drawn to the wrestling challenges of the Furusiyya...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88274;While others busied themselves with martial exploits during the Furusiyya, I found the time to embark on different challenges in the many tents that have cropped up just outside the tournament grounds. Like the other fighters, however, I too suffer from battle sores...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88275;My shortcomings in the Furusiyya competitions do not seem quite as significant after helping myself to a healthy serving of wine. Though it is haram, forbidden, surely a few more drops won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88276;A fighter had the nerve to insult me in front of several of the other attending warriors. The look on his face when I challenged him to a duel revealed him for the coward he was, but honor left him no choice but to accept. I showed no mercy when I cut him down in single combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88277;As I waited my turn in the archery contest, I came across two bedouins, fierce warriors both, who were plotting to get back at a young noble who had dismissed them as desert rabble. I watched as they carefully cut the girth of the noble's saddle just enough to ensure it would snap during the upcoming riding challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88278;As I waited my turn in the archery contest, I came across two bedouins, fierce warriors both, who were plotting to get back at a young noble who had dismissed them as desert rabble. I told them to face the man directly instead of scheming behind his back like bitter old women!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88279;Learned men from all around the land have come to the Furusiyya to observe the spectacle and share insights and wisdom with each other. Between bouts in the wrestling arena, I spent some time listening to their discussions and learned much about how best to rule the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88280;Learned men from all around the land have come to the Furusiyya to observe the spectacle and share insights and wisdom with each other. I joined one of their debates and offered my own opinions on how to govern, only to have them laugh in my face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88281;Two men assigned to my cavalry wing for the upcoming mock battle were constantly at each other's throats. It was clear they would sooner fight each other than our opponents, so for the sake of our team I decided to mediate in their conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88282;Two men assigned to my cavalry wing for the upcoming mock battle were constantly at each other's throats. It was clear they would sooner fight each other than our opponents, so I called them out like the bickering women they were and demanded they settle their differences in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88283;Riders have been sent to all the corners of the land, spreading word that the great martial competition of Furusiyya will soon be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88284;[From.GetTitledName] has been named first champion of my great Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88285;[From.GetTitledName] has performed well enough to be named second champion of my great Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88286;The third champion of my Furusiyya is none other than [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88287;The great Furusiyya competition of [From.GetTitledName] has sadly been cancelled due to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88288;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly perished during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88289;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly been maimed during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88290;Master, your honored guest, [From.GetTitledName], has sadly suffered serious wounds during the events of the Furusiyya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88291;As death closes in on me and I prepare for the life hereafter, I spare a thought for the great Furusiyya I had planned. Sadly the competition will end upon my passing, and the fighters will have to find some other way to prove their worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88292;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. Due to the sudden and unexpected passing of [From.GetTitledFirstName], the Furusiyya has sadly been cancelled.\n\nSigned, \n[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88300;[From.GetTitledName] has decided to hold a great Furusiyya martial competition, and has sent invitations out to warriors across the land. As [From.GetSheHe] is of the same house as you, this initiative has reduced the decadence of your entire dynasty in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88301;[From.GetTitledName] has been declared as the winner of a great Furusiyya martial competition! This triumph reflects well on how decadent the people see your entire dynasty, as you are of the same house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88302;[From.GetTitledName] has been declared the second champion of a great Furusiyya martial competition! This accomplishment has reduced the decadence of your entire dynasty in the eyes of the people, as you and [From.GetFirstName] are of the same house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88303;[From.GetTitledName] has won third place in a great Furusiyya martial competition! People now view your whole dynasty as slightly less decadence, as you and [From.GetFirstName] are of the same house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA88253;I will improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88254;My enemies will fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88255;I did my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88256;The shame of it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88257;I am better for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88258;Perhaps if I improved my footwork...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88259;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88260;A pox on that camel jockey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88261;By the Prophet, that is an illegal move!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88262;I should have stayed in bed this morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88263;Who is next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88264;I am tougher than I look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88265;Many victories will follow, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88266;Checkmate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88267;I should have seen through that feint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88268;It is a game for children and weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88269;Curse this saddle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88270;A momentous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88271;May my enemies quake in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88272;I have fought with honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88273;Such fine, strong men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88274;A red badge of courage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88275;*hic*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88276;All arguments should be settled thus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88277;Clever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88278;No more of this cowardly intrigue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88279;I will use this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88280;Old fools. What do they know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88281;They agreed to set aside their differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88282;Sadly both were badly wounded and our wing suffered as a result...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88284;[From.GetTitledName] is indeed a mighty warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88285;Let no one deny [From.GetHerHis] skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88286;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88287;Then my skill at fighting may still see use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88288;May [From.GetSheHe] find peace in the life hereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88289;May [From.GetSheHe] recover swiftly, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88290;May [From.GetSheHe] recover swiftly, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88291;May those I ruled remember me for my wisdom, Insha'Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88292;But I was going to prove myself as a fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88300;A splendid decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88301;Congratulations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88302;Well deserved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88303;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB88250;Pah. For children playing at being men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88251;Alas, the ongoing war demands my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88288;Tell me of the heroes, not the failures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88289;Tell me of the heroes, not the failures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
