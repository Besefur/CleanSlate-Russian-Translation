EVTDESCHF25000;A promising member of [invited_lodge_soldier.Society.GetName], [invited_lodge_soldier.GetFirstName], is eager to test [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHis] mettle in battle and prove [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHis] loyalty fighting by my side and leading my armies against the enemies of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25001;My brothers and sisters of [Root.Society.GetName] will gladly come to the help of a fellow [finnish_pagan_reformed.GetName] warrior in the time of need, rushing out of their sacred forests to prove their mettle and fight against the enemies of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25004;With the galvanizing presence of [Root.Society.GetName] to lead my troops, scores of new recruits are riding to [Root.Capital.GetName], abandoning their lives as shepherds to become warriors and earn immortal glory by fighting for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25005;The fervor of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] runs still through the veins of the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. When called to action, they rush to their family weapons and ride to my banner, ready to show once more the strength and ruthlessness of their ancestors to all those who oppose us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25006;As the [zun_pagan.GetName] mystics surround me, preparing my body and mind for the ritual, one of them asks me what do I wish to do with the power bestowed to me by [zun_pagan.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25008;My brothers and sisters of [Root.Society.GetName] have heeded my call to action. [scoped_slavic_savior.GetTitledFirstName], a valiant follower of [scoped_slavic_savior.Religion.GetRandomGodName], has assembled a host of warriors to aid me in the ongoing war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25009;[scoped_slavic_savior.GetFirstName] has been working restlessly to aid [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] win the war since [scoped_slavic_savior.GetHerHis] arrival. I must admit I have grown really fond of [scoped_slavic_savior.GetHerHim] in the past few days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25010;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has grown really fond of me since I joined [From.GetHerHis] campaign. It has come to the point where [From.GetSheHe] flat out admitted [From.GetHerHis] love for me openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25011;I was happy to discover that [From.GetFirstName] shares my feeling for [From.GetHerHim]. Now that we are together, nothing will be able to stop us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25012;Unfortunately, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] does not shares my feelings for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25013;[scoped_slavic_savior.GetFirstName] has been working restlessly to aid [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] win the war since [scoped_slavic_savior.GetHerHis] arrival. I could certainly use more fighters like [scoped_slavic_savior.GetHerHim] in my court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25026;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has organized several outstanding athletes and gladiators under [From.GetHerHis] employ to form the brotherhood of the Olympian Champions, a society dedicated to the pursuit of excellence through physical labor.\nAlthough this society is based for the most part on Hellenic principles, its doors are open to any barbarian that shows [From.GetHerHis] willingness to learn discipline and follow the teachings of the school's masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25030;With the help of [Root.Society.GetName], this battle is ours to lose! Already my fellow fighters are rallying from all over the realm, ready to show me their bravery in battle. In but a few months, we will drown our enemies in steel and blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25032;New, eager fighters have joined me at §Y[Root.Location.GetName]§! to earn their glory by my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25033;Reinforcements from [Root.Society.GetName] have been dwindling since a few weeks. The promise of eternal glory does no longer yield enough attraction to the remaining members of the Lodge. Perhaps some need another kind of persuasion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25034;Some of the more undisciplined elements within my new troops have started to complain that I do not share the loot from our battles equally. They are demanding for what they consider their rightful compensation, threatening to leave my army if their request is denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25037;The valor I have shown in battle has not inspired just seasoned warriors. Many of my subjects have traveled to [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to prove their worth against my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25040;The shamans from [Root.Society.GetName] quickly explain to me how, before deciding what kind of spirit I wish to trap, we must determine what sort of fetish I am trying to create...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25041;The shamans of [Root.Society.GetName] have completed the preliminary work for my spirit-mask. Before moving onto the sacred carving, they need to know how much am I willing to invest in the creation of this artifact. A mask carved from rarer woods and imbued with sacred oils will be capable to channel more powerful spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25042;The shamans of [Root.Society.GetName] have completed the preliminary work for my idol. The only thing that I have left to tell them is what sort of spirit do I wish to curry the favor of and how much I am willing to invest in the rare resources needed to craft the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25043;My new mask is nearly complete. The only thing that is left for the shamans to do is fill it with a powerful spirit that will inspire me whenever I wear it, giving me with the strength and determination I need to crush my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25044;My new mask is nearly complete. The only thing that is left for the shamans to do is fill it with a spirit that will inspire me whenever I wear it, giving me with the strength and determination I need to defeat my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25045;My new mask is nearly complete. The only thing that is left for the shamans to do is fill it with a spirit that will inspire me whenever I wear it, giving me a bit more strength and determination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25046;As the last symbols are painted upon the carved surface of the totem, the shamans sings their spells around it, binding the Trickster spirit inside the sacred wood, so that it might serve me and my descendants for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25047;I spend the entire night awake, tormented by the yells of the shamans chanting their spells to entrap a spirit in my new idol. At dawn, the tired old men present me with the ivory artifact, now imbued with its vengeful new guest. The shamans assure me that I will be able to turn the power inside it against my enemies and that the spirit will faithfully serve all of my descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25048;After giving me my new magic staff, the shamans take some time to explain to me how I will be able to summon winds and rain and control the very heavens by properly channeling the powers contained within this precious artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25049;As some of the shamans paint the final symbols on the large wooden mask, the smoke of the many offerings fills the air and the magic chants resonate through the field, the spirit is bound to the artifact, imbuing it with arcane power. The shamans offer me the mask, assuring me that I will be able to make use of its magic by wearing it in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The shamans offer me the mask, assuring me that I will be able to make use of its magic by wearing it in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF25051;The shamans carve the final details on the surface of the mask, whispering ancient spells to bind the ethereal spirit to it for centuries to come. When they are satisfied with their work, they turn around and offer me the artifact, assuring me that I will be able to access to its power by wearing it in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHF25054;The shamans' work has finally born its fruits. My new mask is ready, filled with the essence of an ancient spirit which the shamans assure me will grant me a portion of its power to use against my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25021;I must show my devotion to the divine patrons of my Lodge if I wish for them to favor me in battle. The greater my sacrifice the greater will be the reward that the old gods will grant me in the wars to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25022;Two warriors from the Lodge carry [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetFirstName] outside, ignoring [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHis] kicking and screaming. While the priests prepare me for the ritual by inscribing holy signs under my skin, the offering is brought to the tallest tree we can find and hanged from its strongest branch. We then start chanting hymns to the old gods under the twitching shadow of [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We then start chanting hymns to the old gods under the twitching shadow of [sacrificed_courtier.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25024;A couple of fellow warriors help me constrain the majestic offering that I have personally picked from my livestock for this occasion. While a a priest chants, I plunge the sacrificial dagger deep into the beast's flesh, letting its blood shower over my face. I turn around and the priests inscribe a few holy symbols on my face with blood and dirt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25025;My fellow warriors accompany me into the wilderness, helping me to carry my generous offering to the gods. When we are far from civilization, we bury the gold and burn the food. While a priest chants, invoking the protectors of the Lodge to bestow me their power, one of my fellow warriors inscribes a few symbols on my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25021;Although I follow the teachings of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], giving to the old gods their due might help me in the coming wars. Their violent nature well fits my need for fierceness and savagery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25022;We ride for a few hours in the wilderness, leaving all signs of civilization behind us. Once we are alone, a pair of fellow warriors tie [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetFirstName] on the ground and I repeatedly trample [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim] with my horse while the priests beat their drums and chant around us. Once the offering has been made, the warriors paint my face and invoke the spirits' powers to protect me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25022;After leading [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetFirstName] in the woods, a few warriors and I start stalking [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim], our faces painted and our bodies covered in pelts. We run after our prey, howling the gods' names and throwing rocks at [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim]. In the end, after having surrounded [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim], we tear [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim] apart, offering [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHis] flesh to the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF25022;Under the maddening beating of the shamans' drums, the warriors bring [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetFirstName] forward. I approach [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim], my face inscribed with the sacred symbols, and carve a long cut through [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHis] throat, grabbing [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHim] by the head and showering the Lodge's totem with [scoped_war_sacrifice.GetHerHis] blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25010;I love you too, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25011;To victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25012;I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25013;[scoped_slavic_savior.GetSheHeCap] has earned my trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25026;Sounds fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25030;Come, my friends! Eternal glory awaits the bravest among us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25033;What kind of warriors are you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25034;This is but a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25037;I will have them trained in no time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25040;A great mask of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25041;I will spare no expenses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25044;I wish you to summon a brave spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25045;I wish you to summon a resentful spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25046;This spirit will protect the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] tribe from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25048;Is it supposed to make all this noise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25049;My armies will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25050;Let my foes tremble at my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25051;My family will treasure this gift forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25010;You are not really my type.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25013;Still, I shouldn't be too careless trusting a stranger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25021;I will sacrifice one of my people to the old gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25026;Bah! This looks suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25033;I will share my loot with any who wish to join me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25034;You shall have your money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25037;Your bravery moves me, but this is not your fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF25044;I wish you to summon a Trickster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25045;I wish you to summon a fleeting spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF25001;Perhaps I do not need their assistance for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25006;On second thought, maybe this was a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25021;I will offer food and gold to satisfy your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25037;You can help with the supply lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
