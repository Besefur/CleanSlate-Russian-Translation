EVTDESCHF25601;Before we leave for this perilous journey to slay the monster that is menacing my subjects, I should make an offering to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], to make sure I am shielded from the preternatural powers of the creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF25600;Tonight, the mead hall has been inflamed by rumors of a great wolf wandering through the forests near [Root.Capital.GetName]. The man who spotted the beast claims that it is without a doubt one of Fenrir's sons, escaped from its frozen prison. The older members of the Lodge agree that, as the [Root.GetLordLady] of [Root.Capital.GetName], it is my duty to track down and slay this beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25602;The time has come for us to leave the safe confines of civilization and venture forth into the dark domain of the monster plaguing my lands. With [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s protection, I am sure to track down this creature and put an end to the threat it poses to my subjects once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25603;Our long search for the mysterious beast has led [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] and I on some dangerous, unmapped paths. It takes only a second of distraction before I find myself grasping for something as I fall from a cliff-side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25604;My sight wavers for a moment, I feel my heart stop and my teeth jitter as the clouded sky spirals above me and I catch a glimpse of the jagged rocks waiting beneath me. I feel a sudden pain crossing through my chest and fear for the worst, but then I realize it is caused by [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] pulling me from my arm and dragging me back to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25605;As I hang on the precipice, struggling to crawl back to the path, I watch helplessly as [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] looks back at me. It takes me to call [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] several times before [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] finally unfreezes and comes to my help. Whether it was for cowardice or malice, my own companion has nearly left me to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25606;Our long search for the mysterious beast has led [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] and I on some dangerous, unmapped paths. It takes only a second of distraction before [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] loses [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] footing near the edge of a cliff, finding [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerselfHimself] grasping for something as [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] starts falling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25607;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] struggles, desperately trying to take a firm hold of my hand. I tell [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to keep calm, pulling [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] arm up over the hill's edge. We both lay on the wild path for a while, breathing heavily. As soon as [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] has recovered enough to stand up, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] thanks me profusely for saving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25608;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. Given that wandering aimlessly in a unmapped area would just be a waste of time and put us at risk of losing our own path, we are determined to find some trace of the beast before venturing any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25609;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. It is not long before I stumble upon the half-eaten remains of the creature's last prey, a dismembered deer, floating in a crimson pond. I am certain that examining this carcass will grant me insight on this terrible beast I am trying to hunt down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25610;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. As I make my way through the wilderness, sharpening my senses to look for any trace of the creature, my mind keeps returning to the nature of the beast itself, and to any knowledge about its kind that I have acquired in my past hunts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25611;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. Our search bears little fruit when the night catches up with us. Having to find refuge from the darkness, we make our way to the shack of an old hermit. The man is not very talkative, but he does seem to know about the beast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25612;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. The path ahead of us in unclear and unmapped, and I fear that, if we are not careful, we might end up losing ourselves in the wilderness, where we will be easy prey to the terrible creature that we are hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25613;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. Despite beginning this hunt with the most unwavering resolution, I am starting to feel uncertain of our chances of success. The journey to the creature's lair has been rife with weird signs and bad omens of the most grotesque and unsettling nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25614;The search for the great wolf has brought my expedition through a deep forest. Our foe may be fearsome, but our journey to its lair was filled with the most auspicious omens. It is quite clear that the spirits of the forest are welcoming our arrival and helping me in my quest to slay the monster haunting this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25615;I let [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] walk past me as I watch the sun set beyond the leafage of the dark forest we have reached in the search of the great wolf. [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] keeps [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerselfHimself] close to me, comforted by the presence of a fellow hunter by [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] side, and hopelessly unaware that the terrible beast that [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] was set to slay was me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25617;We have searched for this elusive creature for weeks now, but to no avail. I was unable to find any trace of the great beast, and had to eventually resign myself to abandon the quest and head back to [Root.Capital.GetName]. Some of my fellow warriors were eager to hear of my story upon my return, expecting me to bring the head of the monster as a trophy, and most were quite disappointed to learn of my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25618;There are only a few rays of sunlight lingering over the forest's leaves when I am startled by the coarse howling of a wolf. I have barely the time to look around when the beast emerges growling from the foliage, its gray, sparse mane sprinkled with dried up blood, its yellow eyes staring me with soulless hatred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25619;The great wolf is resting by a riverside, its long snout red with dried up blood. Finding the beast at its weakest gives us a considerable advantage against it, yet we must also be careful not to underestimate this formidable opponent, especially now that we are so close to succeeding in our quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25620;The great wolf fights to the very end, but we are soon able to corner it and pierce through its hide a few times. Keeping the creature at bay with our spears, and patiently wait for the bleeding to weaken it enough to strike again. I land the final blow through the wolf's skull, pushing the creature on the ground, finally vanquished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25621;The fight to slay the great wolf will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly killed me, assaulting us in a flurry of slashing claws and gnawing teeth, yet we persevered and overcame the monster, leaving its carcass bloody and broken by the riverside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently. I scream and punch the creature with my free arm, until it finally releases me. When I finally retake my senses and push myself up, soaked in my own blood, there is no trace of the wolf left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently. I scream and punch the creature with my free arm, but the wolf is relentless and, after momentarily losing its hold, it snaps its jaws on my throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25624;Just as the wolf is about to strike, I swiftly push [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] directly into the beast's jaws, quickly turning around and running for my life as my companion is horribly mangled by the monstrous creature. My fellow warriors might think me a coward for leaving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to die only to save myself, but I will at least be a living coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25626;The evil that had corrupted the sacred spirit of the bear has been cleansed through the shedding of our blood and the death of the creature. It is now our duty to consume its flesh and bury its bones so that this majestic beast can be born again. After completing our ritual, I leave the bear's skull on top of a tree and finally begin my journey back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25627;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] struggles, desperately trying to take a firm hold of my hand. I tell [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to keep calm, pulling [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] arm up over the hill's edge. Yet, just as I am about to drag [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to safety, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] hand slips and [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] falls screaming in the abyss below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25628;My fellow warriors welcome my return triumphantly. With all the meat gathered from my hunt, we will be able to organize a large feast and celebrate my victory over the monster with all the pomp it deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25629;The squealing increases as I approach the eagle's nest. One of its chicks is hiding there, blind and featherless, squawking for food. The spawn of such a powerful beast could serve me well, if properly trained, serving me in future hunts and terrorizing my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25630;Several months have passed since I took the great eagle's nestling after killing its terrible mother. The chick has grown strong and tame under my watch. Unlike its parent, it will spend its life serving men rather than hunting us down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF25631;After years of loyal service and countless hunts, my eagle has finally taken to its last flight to join its ancestors in the Eternal Blue Sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCBHF25600;Tonight, the mead hall has been inflamed by rumors of a great wolf wandering through the forests near [Root.Capital.GetName]. The man who spotted the beast claims that it is without a doubt one of Medeina's cohorts, driven mad after tasting human flesh. The older members of the Lodge agree that, as the [Root.GetLordLady] of [Root.Capital.GetName], it is my duty to track down and slay this beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25602;The time has come for us to leave the safe confines of civilization and venture forth into the dark domain of the monster plaguing my lands. With [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s protection and my keen hunting skills, I am sure to track down this creature and put an end to the threat it poses to my subjects once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25608;The search for the great eagle has brought my expedition to the slopes of a barren hill. Given that wandering aimlessly in a unmapped area would just be a waste of time and put us at risk of losing our own path, we are determined to find some trace of the beast before venturing any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25609;The search for the great eagle has brought my expedition to the slopes of a barren hill. It is not long before I stumble upon the half-eaten remains of the creature's last prey, a young goat crushed on the rocks near a steep path. I am certain that examining this carcass will grant me insight on this terrible beast I am trying to hunt down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25610;The search for the great eagle has brought my expedition to the slopes of a barren hill.

EVTDESCBHF25614;The search for the great eagle has brought my expedition to the slopes of a barren hill. Our foe may be fearsome, but our journey to its lair was filled with the most auspicious omens. It is quite clear that the spirits of the mountain are welcoming our arrival and helping me in my quest to slay the monster haunting this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25615;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] and I have been out in the wild for several days now, with no trace of our quarry. As I take a moment to rest under the skeletal husk of a tree and look at my companion, scouring the terrain looking for clues, I am struck by a sudden realization. What if the monster has taken [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]'s form to deceive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25618;When the shrieking battle cry of the eagle pierces my eardrums, making me startle, I am halfway through climbing a large rock formation. An imposing shadow sweeps over the uneven surface of the wall, aimed straight in my direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25619;The great eagle is tucked in its nest, its cruel hooked beak barely peeking from under its wings. Finding the beast at its weakest gives us a considerable advantage against it, yet we must also be careful not to underestimate this formidable opponent, especially now that we are so close to succeeding in our quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25620;I manage to wound one of the eagle's wings as it takes off, leaving the beast unable to flee. The eagle screeches and leaps furiously towards me, its talons grasping for my eyes, but I am able to push it away while taking only a few scratches. As the bird clumsily tries to take flight, I throw my spear through its chest, bringing it down for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25621;The fight to slay the great eagle will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly dragged me to a terrible death during its last assault, but, in the end, we were able to slay it, leaving it to fall screeching from the hill, its wings bloody and broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The eagle's talons grab hold of my clothes, pulling me away from the cliff. I struggle and try to hit the beast, loosening its hold, but not before dooming myself to a harsh fall. When I finally awake, the great eagle is long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The eagle's talons grab hold of my clothes, pulling me away from the cliff. I struggle and try to hit the beast, loosening its hold, but not before dooming myself to a deadly fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBHF25624;I duck as the eagle passes over me, and let myself fall on [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]. My companion's body dampens my fall enough to make me stand up immediately after reaching the ground and run away as fast as my legs can take me, leaving behind myself both the terrible monster and [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], cursing me for my cowardice as the beast already circles over [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCHF25600;Tonight, the mead hall has been inflamed by rumors of a rabid werewolf wandering through the forests near [Root.Capital.GetName]. The man who spotted the beast claims that it is without a doubt one of Lycaon's descendants, hiding during daylight in human form and hunting under the moonlight. The older members of the Lodge agree that it is my duty to track down and slay this beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25608;The search for the great bear has brought my expedition through a dead wood. Given that wandering aimlessly in a unmapped area would just be a waste of time and put us at risk of losing our own path, we are determined to find some trace of the beast before venturing any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It is quite clear that the spirits of the forest are welcoming our arrival and helping me in my quest to slay the monster haunting this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25618;It is hard to tell what time is it, with most of the light blocked by the skeletal branches of the dead trees, but it cannot be too far from sunset when a threatening growl breaks the silence around me, announcing the arrival of a large brown bear. The beast tears down the rotten remains of a trunk as it makes its way towards me with bloodshot eyes and drooling jaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25619;The great bear is resting by its cave, a grotesque mountain of flesh and dark brown fur soaked in filth and blood. Finding the beast at its weakest gives us a considerable advantage against it, yet we must also be careful not to underestimate this formidable opponent, especially now that we are so close to succeeding in our quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25620;When I charge the first strike, the bear's response is sluggish, but, the more I poke at it, the angrier the beast gets. Its hide is thick, so much so that I can barely pierce through it. Yet, I do not discourage myself, maintaining enough distance from my foe to avoid its attacks, hitting it repeatedly until it finally falls dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25621;The fight to slay the great bear will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly crushed me under its massive weight, tearing down several trees in its frenzied drive to kill us, but, in the end, the bear's fury only quickened its bleeding, sealing its death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The bear tramples me in its charge, slamming me against one of the dead trees. I scramble for my spear, and manage to throw it at the beast's head, causing it to falter for a moment. The bear roars and runs away, disappearing in the forest. Unfortunately, the beast's attack was devastating, to the point of making me unable to continue my pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The bear tramples me in its charge, crushing me under its massive weight and leaving me a broken smudge in the middle of the dead forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHF25624;Just as the bear is about to strike, I swiftly push [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] directly into the beast's charge, quickly turning around and running for my life as my companion is horribly mangled by the monstrous creature. My fellow warriors might think me a coward for leaving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to die only to save myself, but I will at least be a living coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDHF25600;Tonight, the mead hall has been inflamed by rumors of a great eagle terrorizing the farmlands of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The man who spotted the beast claims that it is without a doubt one of Perun's children, driven mad after tasting human flesh. The older members of the Lodge agree that, as the [Root.GetLordLady] of [Root.Capital.GetName], it is my duty to track down and slay this beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25608;The search for the great lion has brought my expedition to slopes of a thick patch of grassland. Given that wandering aimlessly in a unmapped area would just be a waste of time and put us at risk of losing our own path, we are determined to find some trace of the beast before venturing any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25609;The search for the great lion has brought my expedition to slopes of a thick patch of grassland. It is not long before I stumble upon the half-eaten remains of the creature's last prey, a dismembered lamb, with barely any meat left on his bones. I am certain that examining this carcass will grant me insight on this terrible beast I am trying to hunt down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It is quite clear that the spirits of the plains are welcoming our arrival and helping me in my quest to slay the monster haunting this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25618;I am following the last set of tracks through a patch of tall grass, when a sudden rustle makes me suddenly stop. I cautiously glance on my left side, and immediately spot the fiery golden eyes of the lion. The beast, crouched on the ground with its jaws half-open, looks ready to pounce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25619;The great lion is resting under a tree, placidly looking at a the horizon. Finding the beast at its weakest gives us a considerable advantage against it, yet we must also be careful not to underestimate this formidable opponent, especially now that we are so close to succeeding in our quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25620;I barely escape the lion's pounce. Just as I slide past the jumping beast, I push my spear through its chest, getting pulled alongside it. The monster roars and claws at me, trying to get rid of the weapon, yet I keep a strong hold on it, pushing it further into the lion's flesh while avoiding its attacks, until the creature finally lays dead beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25621;The fight to slay the great lion will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly skewered me on multiple occasions during its desperate struggle, yet I was able to ignore the pain and focus on my assault, and finally manage to plunge my spear through its eye and put an end to its wicked existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25622;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me, crushing me under its massive weight, its terrible jaws snapping at my throat. By plunging my spear underneath its leg, I am able to stop the beast's assault and slip away. My counterattack was enough to make the lion retreat back in the tall grass. Sadly, my wounds prevent me from pursuing my quarry any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25623;Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me with unfathomable speed, slamming me on the ground and quickly closing its jaws around my neck. The creature's teeth swiftly crush my windpipe, leaving me to drown in my own blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHF25624;Just as the lion is about to strike, I swiftly push [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] directly into the beast's jaws, quickly turning around and running for my life as my companion is horribly mangled by the monstrous creature. My fellow warriors might think me a coward for leaving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to die only to save myself, but I will at least be a living coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25600;I could use you, [strong_hunting_partner.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25601;I will burn the best cattle from my stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25602;Let the hunt begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25605;I can never trust [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHF25608;I will make sure that there are no stones left unturned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25609;It will be a pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25610;I have read much about this sort of beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25611;Perhaps a few coins will loosen your lips?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25612;We will map the path as we move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25613;Nothing but superstitions! [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is surely with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25614;We are fated to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25615;Let the hunt begin anew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25617;At least I tried!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25618;I have slain far bigger game than you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25619;I know exactly how to deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25620;I will make a trophy out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25622;We were so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25623;Ghhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25624;I could never kill that thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25625;I barely survived as it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25626;The spirits have been appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25627;I will have to proceed alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25628;Let us toast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25629;I will take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25630;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25631;All my court will be present at the funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF25631_TOOLTIP;Publicly burn the remains of your eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBHF25600;I will need your skills, [smart_hunting_partner.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25601;I will offer something of value for a safe journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25603;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]! Help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25604;I will never forget your gesture, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25605;How could you just stand there?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25606;Here! Grab my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25607;I would never let something happen to you, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25608;I think I know where our quarry is hiding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25609;I have seen worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25610;There are a few clear ways to fell such a monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25611;You better talk now, old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25612;We will not get lost, my memory will not fail me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25613;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] knows that my heart is pure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25614;We can only hope so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25615;You will never take me alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25618;You will die by my hand, fiend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25619;Now we can corner and gut this monster for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25620_A;We will burn its remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25620_B;The sacred ritual of flaying must be performed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25629;The line of this monster must be extinguished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25631;I will miss that eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHF25631_TOOLTIP;Bury the remains of your eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCHF25600;I would have nobody but you by my side, [loyal_hunting_partner.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25601;A small offering is all I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25603;There must be something I can grab!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25604;I owe you my life, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25605;Let us see if you have better balance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25606;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHeCap] can do it on [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25607;That was nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25613;These signs... There must be another way to interpret them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25615;No, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] is too nice to be the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25618;No! I must save myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25619;Finally! Death to the vile monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHF25620;I will bring the carcass back to my fellow warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDHF25600;The man is raving. There is no such a beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25601;I need no such protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25604;At least you are good for something, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25605;I must kill [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] before [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHe] tries to kill me again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25609;I can handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25611;Perhaps I can convince him to share his knowledge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25613;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], tell me, is there another way to interpret these signs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25618;Take [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], but let me live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25619;I am not sure about this anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDHF25620;I think I hear something from the beast's nest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTEHF25605;I should not be too hard on [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim], it was a difficult situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25608;I will lead this search.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25610;I am sure I know something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25611;Maybe he will talk to you, [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEHF25612;Perhaps if we try marking our path?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFHF25608;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] is better suited for this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFHF25610;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]! Surely you must know something about this creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTGHF25612;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] is better suited for this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTZHF25600;I will hunt the beast down by myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF25611;He must be the werewolf himself! Die, fiend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZHF25615;[scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetSheHeCap] will not live to tell the tale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
