EVTDESC64000;The late nights, the way [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has stopped touching me or even looking at me, the rumors about [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and a courtier being lovers... There is no doubt in my mind, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has an affair with that courtier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64001;Discretion is key to a successful love affair, but we had apparently not been as discreet as we should've been. [From.GetFirstName] somehow found out about me and my lover and confronted me about it, demanding I would break it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64002;I was confronted about my love affair with [From.GetFirstName]'s [From.Spouse.GetManWoman] [From.Spouse.GetFirstName] by [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64003;[From.GetFirstName] attacked me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] love affair with my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64004;Several days after my confrontation with [From.GetFirstName] I was attacked by someone who managed to injure me and disappear before I even started to feel the pain. I collapsed to the floor and that was where [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] found me, with blood gushing from the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64005;My lover is ill and I feel that there is something I should do to ease my lover's pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64006;The cruel wound on my lover's beautiful body had already started to fester.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64010;[target_lover.GetSheHeCap] is so funny and, above all, so beautiful! I think I am falling for [target_lover.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64011;No matter what I was doing or where I was, [From.GetTitledFirstName] always seemed to find me but seemed tongue-tied and shy. I was alone in the library, reading, when [From.GetSheHe] finally got the courage to talk to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I talked for hours and soon became inseparable. If there was a chore, a homework or anything we could do together, we did it. If it weren't for my nanny then we would have slept in the same bed too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64013;I fled from [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s scornful reply and [From.GetHerHis] laughter that followed me down the stairs. How could I ever have felt anything for that, that... idiot?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64015;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has grown old and less-than-attractive. Maybe a young mistress will bring some excitement to my life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64016;I have noticed how [From.GetFirstName] has stopped looking at me the way [From.GetSheHe] used to do, with a kind of burning desire for me and my body. These days, [From.GetSheHe] looks at the young courtiers with high bosoms and slender waists with the look that used to be reserved for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64017;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s wife is a frail old thing who probably used to be beautiful. No wonder [From.GetSheHe] has started eyeing us lovelier ladies at court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64018;[From.GetTitledFirstName] responded to my advances and soon we were... engaging in a very stimulating activity. In short: the love-making was amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64019;The scorn I was met by when I tried to talk [From.GetTitledFirstName] into meeting me somewhere more private really hurt. [From.GetSheHeCap] actually laughed at my advances and told me I was both too old and too ugly for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64020;[From.GetFirstName] had noticed how I had started looking at the other women at court and the whispers about me flirting with the beautiful ladies at court made [From.GetHerHim] draw some conclusions [From.GetSheHe] obviously did not appreciate. I was yelled at for hours, or so it felt, about the 'sinfulness of adultery' and 'why don't you think I am attractive anymore?'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64025;It is as if I see [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] for the first time: [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] good-natured spirit, the interesting and funny quirks [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] has and how lovely [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] really is. Could it be that I love my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64030;I have finally gotten a chance to do something special with my special someone and there are so many things I want to do! Should I try to entertain [target_lover.GetHerHim] at the court, or maybe we should spend some time in my isolated country cottage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64035;No matter what I do, my sweetheart never seems happy, complaining that we never do anything exciting together and sulks when I tell [target_lover.GetHerHim] I have too much to do to be able to entertain [target_lover.GetHerHim] all the time. Having a lover is more hard work than I thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64040;I caught them together in our own bed, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] lover! I screamed for [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] lover to get out and then confronted [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64041;I thought [From.GetFirstName] would be gone for several hours, so when [From.GetSheHe] opened the door to the bedroom and caught my lover and I in a rather embarrassing embrace and, after [From.GetHerHis] initial surprise, shouted at my lover to get out I was speechless. [From.GetSheHeCap] demanded that I stopped seeing my lover, or else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64045;I don't know what has happened lately, no matter what my lover does I feel irritated and have actually started to avoid [target_lover.GetHerHim]. Our relationship brings me only irritation, it is as if we have grown apart...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64046;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has avoided me for some time, and the rare occasions when we meet have turned from the love-filled evenings I remember to hours of arguing and disagreement. It did not come as a shock when [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] wanted to end our relationship but it hurt more than I thought it would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64050;Since we were young, we had always felt there was something between us, something that made certain situations more awkward than they should have been. Our teenage infatuation has deepened and grown into something more, something that is hard to explain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64051;The teenage infatuation I felt for [From.GetTitledFirstName] has turned into something more, maybe love, and I know [From.GetTitledFirstName] feels the same way as I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64052;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I used to have a... teenage crush on each other and I met [From.GetHerHim] today and the old feelings welled up. Before I could say something embarrassing, [From.GetTitledFirstName] laughed away our teenage infatuation and told me that [From.GetSheHe] is still fond of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64055;My child shows every sign of being infatuated with a courtier and follows the person in question everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64060;My love is married to another, and it pains my soul I will never be able to marry [target_lover.GetHerHim] myself. Oh, how cruel love can be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64065;The unsatisfying relationship with a married [target_lover.GetManWoman] is really becoming irksome. I wish I could love [target_lover.GetHerHim] openly, without fearing everyone's scorn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64070;Seeing another [target_lover.GetManWoman] behind my spouse's back is becoming quite troublesome for me, the lies tear at my soul and my longing to be with my lover is almost too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64075;I am planning a special occasion with my lover, but my wife is quite insistent on alternate plans. Who is more important to me, my lover or my wife?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64076;I was glad [From.GetFirstName] wanted to arrange a ball and I invited all my friends for a night I would never forget. The ball was wonderful, until I met my husband [From.GetFirstName]'s lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64077;My wife [From.GetTitledFirstName] came up to me, slapped me and left the ball. My lover came running after her and gave me a look that meant trouble ahead. My wife [From.GetFirstName] and my lover had met and my wife had learnt about our adulterous relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64080;My wife has retired to the convent for a short while, to gather her thoughts and find some peace, maybe even God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64085;I love [target_lover.GetHerHim] and [target_lover.GetSheHe] loves me, we are both adults and nothing or nobody will stop us getting married!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64086;Two people eloped, got married without anyone's consent except their own and it falls to me as their liege to either accept the marriage or do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64087;[From.GetTitledFirstName] could not accept our marriage and now my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and I finds ourselves in the prison of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64088;I almost regret eloping with [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] as it caused us to be banished by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. But they say love conquers all and at least I have my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] with me in my misery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64090;We both want children, [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] and I, but we haven't been blessed with any yet. What do we do wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64100;I had a fiery row with my wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], worse than any we ever had before. My lover is eager to comfort me and I could really use some comfort right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64101;The 'comfort' my lover offered me has resulted in her being pregnant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64102;Still fuming with anger after the fiery row with [From.GetTitledFirstName], I saw [From.GetHerHim] kiss another woman in the garden and then take her by the hand, leading her somewhere more private I am sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64105;The constant quarrels with [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] adulterous affairs has brought me to a boiling point. If I ever loved [From.GetHerHim], that love has disappeared with this latest betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64110;No matter how discreet I have been with my lover, my [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] still manages to grow suspicious of my behavior. I think I might have tried too hard to be inconspicuous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64115;My lover accused me of loving my spouse [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] more than [target_lover.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64120;I heard the news from my lover first, then the whole court was buzzing with the news. My spouse [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] had made my adulterous affair public!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64125;My spouse [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has humiliated me publicly! [Root.Spouse.GetSheHeCap] kissed [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] lover in public and now everyone knows about their adulterous affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64126;I was arrested and imprisoned by [From.GetTitledFirstName] when [From.GetSheHe] saw me kiss [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] in public, revealing to everyone our adulterous affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64127;I hadn't exactly surmised that my spouse [From.GetTitledFirstName] would have me arrested and imprisoned for kissing my lover and making our affair public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64130;I am married to a [Root.Spouse.GetManWoman] I love and it is such a blissful state! I wish everyone could experience love such as ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64135;I want to give a special surprise to my loved one, what shall it be? A poem, telling of my deep love for [target_lover.GetHerHim], finding the most beautiful flower in the forest to prove my love or maybe find a small trinket in the market for [target_lover.GetHerHim] to treasure for ever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64140;This war is a necessary one, but the heart is aching worse than any wounds the war might inflict upon me, simply by being separated from my love. The camp has no lack in women willing to embrace those men who seek them out, and they might be able ease my pain, although for just a short while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA64000;I will confront [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64001;You don't understand our relationship, we are in love...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64002;I will never let [From.Spouse.GetHerHim] go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64003;[From.GetFirstName] hurt me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64004;The wound forced me to bed for several days;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64005;I will stay at my lover's bed and take good care of him myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64006;I will take care of you until the wound has healed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64010;I'll try and talk to [target_lover.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64011;You are so sweet! I like you too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64012;Is this how it is when you are in love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64013;I have to accept that I'm a failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64015;I'm sure my wife will allow me to indulge myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64016;So [From.GetSheHe] did not think I would notice?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64017;[From.GetSheHeCap] is not too hard on the eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64018;I think I am in love...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64019;I was taken aback by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s scorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64020;I think [From.GetFirstName] is angry about me flirting with the ladies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64025;Embrace the love I feel for [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64030;I shall take [target_lover.GetHerHim] to my isolated country cottage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64035;Throw a big party for [target_lover.GetHerHis] entertainment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64040;In our own bed?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64041;I won't break it up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64045;I don't love [target_lover.GetHerHim] anymore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64046;In the end we parted as friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64050;Our infatuation has turned into love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64051;So this is love...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64052;Yes, it was only a teenage infatuation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64055;Aw, how sweet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64060;I will write a poem of my pain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64065;And thus it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64070;It's time to end such affairs and settle down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64075;Ignore my wife, and go visit my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64076;How could [From.GetSheHe] do that to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64077;And now she hates me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64080;Perfect occasion to spend time with my lover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64085;We elope to get married;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64086;Order them seized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64087;Curse you, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64088;Banishing us for getting married? That's low even for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64090;Ask for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s help with our childless marriage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64100;Retire to the country manor with my lover for a while;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64101;How wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64102;I hate him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64105;I loathe, no, I hate [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64110;Tell [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] it's none of [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] business;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64115;Buy [target_lover.GetHerHim] an expensive gift to prove my love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64120;Disown the affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64125;Bear it stoically;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64126;That was a bit careless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64127;I should've been more discreet with the affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64130;It's such a stress-relief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64135;I shall craft a love poem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64140;This war will deepen my love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB64000;I will confront [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] lover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64001;I will break it up, but always remember: you forced me to do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64002;Fine, I'll stop my love affair with [From.Spouse.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64004;The wound made me infirm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64005;I will pay the best physician to cure my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64006;I will pay the best physician to cure you, my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64010;[target_lover.GetSheHeCap]'s not that pretty anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64011;Go away! I don't like you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64013;Who dares, wins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64015;My wife will probably not find out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64017;I deserve someone better than [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64025;Deny the love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64030;I'll sponsor entertainment at the local court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64035;Take [target_lover.GetHerHim] to do something dangerous, like hunting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64041;Anything for the sake of domestic peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64050;This was just something for us growing up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64052;But I loved you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64055;Maybe it will pass;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64060;Wine will cure my pains;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64065;Maybe it can still work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64070;It will work out if I give it a bit more effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64075;Arrange a ball and invite my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64080;Be discreet about spending time with my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB64140;I will resist Satan's temptations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC64002;I will claw your eyes out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64005;Not worth my time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64006;This is not worth my time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64015;No, adultery is a sin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64030;Nah, I'll spend the time with my friends instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC64065;No, I will make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC64070;I don't care for my spouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC64130;Life is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64135;I shall buy something nice in the market;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64140;Visiting some camp-followers should ease my pain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD64002;Your interference will cost you dearly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD64005;I will stay at my lover's bed and take good care of her myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
