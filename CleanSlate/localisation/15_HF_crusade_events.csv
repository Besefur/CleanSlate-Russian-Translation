EVTDESC_HF_49001;The last days have been filled with arguments back and forth. No matter what I try to tell [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetFirstName], it always ends up leading into another conflict.\n\nI wake up to my men searching all of [Root.Capital.GetName] for [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetHerHim]. It seems [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetSheHe] has left in the middle of the night, and fled the city. Though we surely have had our disagreements, I did not expect [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetHerHim] to simply run away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49002;I am strolling through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] when I notice the throngs of people rushing down to the harbor. Somewhat curious what might have happened, I tell my retainers we will make our way down there as well.\n\nA grand ship unlike any I have ever seen is docked by the port, several [From.Culture.GetGroupName] flags hanging from the masts. I can see several guards rushing about the deck, as they are helping someone off the boat. As the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.Capital.GetName], it is only right that I am the one to greet them.\n\nAn impressive looking [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetTitle] makes [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetHerHis] way off the ship, instantly locking eyes with me. With a smile, [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetSheHe] takes my hand and says "My [Root.GetLordLady], I need your help.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49003;It has been some time since [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetTitledName] came to my court, and it has certainly been quite the experience having [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetHerHim] around. However, today [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetSheHe] came to talk to me about putting [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetHerHim] on the throne of Byzantium.\n\n"My dear [Root.GetLordLady], I know you have had your disagreements with the Empire. And of course, you would be well paid..." [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetSheHeCap] tells me. With some of the money I would receive from [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetTitledName], I could join the ongoing preparations for the Crusade and convince the other members to make this part of our goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49004;In a passionate speech [From.GetTitledName] explains how all of us must gather our men to support [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetTitledName] for the throne of [e_byzantium.GetName]. The Emperors of [e_byzantium.GetName] have for a long time looked down upon the rest of us, pretending to be the descendants of the Romans. Now it is time to show them that we can overthrow the false Emperor in their midst as well.\n\nWith the gifts sent by [From.GetTitledName], [From.GetSheHe] has managed to convince the rest of the [From.Religion.GetName] realm to target Constantinople as part of the next Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49005;It seems that interest for the Crusade towards Constantinople has become somewhat less interesting in most people's eyes, even going so far as to consider abandoning it. Maybe I should revitalize their interest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49007;The Crusaders are leaving the [From.Religion.GetName] realm, their eyes towards Constantinople and [e_byzantium.GetName]. At the same time, the Pope has made an enraged speech about the vices of men and how the good faithful have been led astray. [k_papacy.Holder.GetSheHeCap] threatens every single Crusader with excommunication from the church, but the Crusaders continues onwards towards the ancient capital at the Bosporus.\n\nWhat was once the bastion of the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] faith is now desperately protecting itself, and [e_byzantium.Holder.GetTitledName] is looking for any help [e_byzantium.Holder.GetSheHe] can get.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49008;Constantinople falls to great cheers from the [From.Religion.GetName] Crusaders. The rest of the world weeps as the last lingering memories of the Roman Empire shatter. The former Emperor [FromFrom.GetDynName] has run off to [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] to try and restore what remains of the Empire.\n\n[Root.GetByzantineRefugeeText]Now [e_latin_empire.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] sits on the throne in Constantinople. [e_latin_empire.Holder.GetSheHeCap] has declared [e_latin_empire.Holder.GetHerselfHimself] the new ruler of the Greek Empire, and will rule with both Greek and Latin traditions in mind.\n\nOnly time will tell, if the [From.Religion.GetName]s will be remembered as the ones who broke the [From.Religion.GetGroupName] Bulwark, or the ones who restored Constantinople to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49020;Once more [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has been at the forefront of the Crusade, single handedly bringing victory to the faith. Known throughout all the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] world as one of the most loyal and fierce [Root.Religion.GetName] there is, [Root.GetSheHe] is revered wherever [Root.GetSheHe] goes.\n\nRespect is showered upon [Root.GetTitledName] and [Root.GetHerHis] family, the legends and tales of their deeds will be brought down in history as the deciding factor of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] victory in the face of adversity. There is no doubt the members of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty will continue bringing the lost lands into the fold of the faith, and continue to be at the vanguard of the Crusades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49021;"Forward!" I shout as I cut down another of the men charging at me. "For [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]! To victory!"\nAt some point all my men seem to be pushed away, and I grit my teeth for the onslaught of incoming enemies. I can see their commander through the battle, sitting back on a horse with a grin on his face. If I am going down, I am bringing him with me. One cut follow another, and I see his grin slowly fade to a grimace as he tries to back out of the fight he is slowly being pulled into.\n\nI look down upon the dead commander and his retinue as the rest of the battle is settling down. "My [Root.GetLordLady], are you all right?" One of my guards comes running over, looking across my bloodied body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49101;[From.GetTitledName] has started planning a campaign against the pagans of the north. For too long, the pagans have been steadfast in their fights against the [From.Religion.GetGroupName]s, and [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to convert them with the sword.\n\nThe wild people of the north have started gathering in response, bellowing their battle hymns and demonic rituals, unstoppable in their frenzy. Surely, this will lead to a bloodbath on both sides, as neither will let the other be.\n\nWith a final blessing from [From.RelHead.GetTitledName], the armies of the Teutons leave the south for good. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49106;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\n\n[northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName] is a dangerous force to be reckoned with, and I agree with your assessment that [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetSheHe] needs to be dealt with. My troops are ready to march towards the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49107;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nWe are ready to march our troops against [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName], but we will need monetary support for the campaign.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49108;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI agree [northern_crusade_potential_target.GetTitledName] is a dangerous foe, and we would need a base for our campaigns against the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49110;The Teutonics march towards [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands, to secure it for Christianity. The pagans have had too long to convert peacefully, now they will be taken by the sword.\n\nTheir first goal is to take out [northern_crusade_target_character.GetTitledFirstName], the warlord of [northern_crusade_target_character.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]. If they secure [northern_crusade_target_character.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], they will use it as a base to quell the rest of the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands.\n\nThe blood of the pagans will flow through the rivers of the north, no mercy will be shown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49112_A;To the esteemed [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nThe Teutonic Order thanks you for your aid throughout the war for [northern_crusade_title.GetBaseName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49112_B;To the esteemed [Root.GetTitledName]\n\nThe Teutonic Order thanks you for your aid throughout the war for [northern_crusade_title.GetBaseName]. We have sent you a small gift to show our appreciation for your assistance.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49113;After repeated tries to pacify the north, the Teutonic Knights have finally given up. At every turn, the pagans of the north have come together to protect their way of life.\n\nAs the Teutonic Knights finally renounced their Crusade against the pagans, the other Christians in the north will surely have a harder task at hand. With their opponents leaving, the pagans look to the south for potential new expansion.\n\nThe rest of the world awaits the pagan fury. The unquelled rampage of the north will surely come soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49114;A large honor guard of the Teutons appear outside of [Root.Capital.GetName], led by [From.GetTitledName] [From.GetHerselfHimself]. In response to my aid in their latest wars, they have decided to award me and all my descendants the honor of friendship with the Teutonic Knights.\n\nForevermore, the Order will stay by our side as valiant knights and friends, if we should ever need them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_49115;Though it has been a long and grueling fight between the Teutons and the natives of the [northern_crusade_kingdom_title.GetAdjective] lands, the campaign has finally ended with victory for the Christians.\n\nNo longer will the faithful in the north fear for their lives, as the Teutonic Knights patrol the lands and make sure to punish any infidels who dare step into Christian lands. What was once known as the pagan fury of the north has been pacified, never to be seen again.\n\nThe rampage and danger has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_49001;Maybe I should not have said all those things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_49002;Welcome to [Root.Capital.GetName], my [fourth_crusade_byzantine_refugee.GetLordLady].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_49112;It was the least I could do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_49114;It is an honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_49110;And so the infidels march...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49113;Another failure from the [From.Religion.GetName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_49115;Impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HF_49007;Hah! Let the wild dogs fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49008;How could they!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49101;Let them come, and be slaughtered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49110;What will the [From.Religion.GetName]s think of next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_HF_49113;Cursed infidels, both of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
