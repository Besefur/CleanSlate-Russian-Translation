EVTDESC88500;The holy month of Ramadan is upon us, and all faithful Muslims, save the infirm and those on a journey, must observe the fast during daylight hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88501;Ramadan is a blessed time for charity and kindness, and in that spirit you could release the prisoners languishing in your dungeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88502;The Prophet, may Allah honor him and grant him peace, teaches the importance of charity and good deeds, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. There are many poor in [Root.Location.GetName] who could be helped if you but parted with some of your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88503;Now is the time for prayers and devoted reading of the Qur'an. After the sun has set, you could recite the Qur'an through Tarawih prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88504;The strict fast you have been observing during the daylight hours of Ramadan has weakened you to the point of illness. As the ill are exempted from fasting, there would be no shame or loss of piety if you abandoned the fast and made up for the lost days at a later time. If you continue, however, there could be serious repercussions to your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88505;Your decision to continue fasting despite your illness has proved a costly one. You have become infirm with weakness due to lack of food and water, and left with no choice but to interrupt the fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88506;The fast you have observed during Ramadan has taught you the value of moderation in all things, and the dangers of indulgence and excess. You feel closer to Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88507;You have given generously to the poor during Ramadan and performed many good deeds. The urge to help those in need comes naturally to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88508;The ongoing war demands your full attention, and you and your men can no longer continue your fast. You will have to make up the lost days at a later date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88509;You have become ill and will have to abandon the fast. The lost days will have to be made up at a later date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88510;The end of Ramadan approaches, and that means the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr is upon us. The preparations for the planned feast to celebrate this have already been made, and now the time has come to invite your vassals to your palace. What say you, Master?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88511;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. The end of Ramadan draws near, and to celebrate the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr I have decided to hold a great feast in my palace. You are of course invited.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88512;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. I give thanks for your invitation to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr at your palace, but I regret to inform you I cannot attend.\n\nYour servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88513;The great banquet you ordered held to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr and the end of Ramadan was a rousing success! The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all. Your guests seemed suitably impressed by your wealth and generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88514;The great banquet held by [From.GetTitledName] to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr and the end of Ramadan was a splendid occasion. The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88515;To celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, perhaps you should present a gift to your beloved wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88516;To celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, perhaps you should present gifts to your beloved wives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88517;The hunger pains you experience during the fast have become unbearable due to your gluttonous nature. With the sun still high in the sky, you break into the pantry and help yourself to the food inside while tears stream down your face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88518;Overcome with lust and in broad daylight during the fast, you sinfully engage in the pleasures of the flesh with a serving girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88519;Though the fast requires you to abstain from food and drink during the daylight hours, you helped yourself to enough wine to fall into a drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88520;Many in [Root.Location.GetName] have donated generously to provide for the poor during the holy month of Ramadan. The gold has been gathered in an urn but when you approach it to donate your own share, your greedy nature results in your coin purse gaining weight instead of losing it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88521;As a cynical unbeliever, you do your best to uphold the appearance of observing the fast, but behind closed doors you do not think twice about eating and drinking to your heart's content, be it day or night. One day you are caught in the act...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88522;Your fast and observance of the holy month of Ramadan has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA88516;Yes, but only for [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], my dear first wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88517;Mmhf... c-can't.. help myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88518;I should not have done that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88519;I-I'm schorry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88520;No one will miss a few coins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88521;I-It's not what it looks like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88522;Until next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB88501;No, they are where they belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88502;No, I would not disturb their fast by giving them means to buy food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88503;No, I do not have the time to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB88515;No, my affection for her is gift enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB88516;Of course, they will all see my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC88516;My affection for them is gift enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
