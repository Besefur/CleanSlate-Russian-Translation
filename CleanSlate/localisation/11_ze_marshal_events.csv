EVTDESC_ZE_4000;Your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledName], has come to you with a suggestion: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], it is my opinion that [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetTitledNameWithNick] would make an excellent military commander. I suggest we make use of [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetHerHis] talents for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4010;Your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledName], has put forward a plan for experimentation with new military technology, inspired by a supposedly brilliant inventor and engineer that [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has recently befriended. All that is needed is a little funding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4040;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, the experiments consisted in training an large force of musicians to blow their trumpets in unison, thus deafening and stunning the enemy army in preparation for an attack. Attempts were also made to make castle walls tumble by marching around them blowing the trumpets.\n\nUnfortunately, while quite expensive, none of these experiments were successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4050;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, the experiments consisted in drenching a large amount of sheep in oil and setting fire to them, then sending the terrified, screaming animals towards the enemy. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to control the direction of the sheep. The engineer was immolated in a ball of fire and your [Root.GetMarshalName] barely escaped with [Root.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4100;You receive news of your [Root.GetMarshalName]'s activities in [Root.job_marshal.Location.GetName]. It appears [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has been spreading ill words about your rule, encouraging disloyalty among the peasantry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4120;Worrying reports have reached you regarding your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName]. It seems [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has been using your soldiers to extort money from the peasantry in [Root.job_marshal.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_4020;You receive a report from the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a large steel-plated chariot was constructed, propelled by ten men inside pulling it forward, directed by a commander peering out from a revolving turret mounted on top. This vehicle also had several ballistas firing through arrow slits. Though ending up being too slow (and expensive) for actual wartime employment, it still provided some valuable lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_4030;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a new kind of self-propelled arrow was tried out, based on Far Eastern models. Lit by fire, these arrows would scream and fly away leaving a trail of smoke and then explode on impact, killing several of the livestock used as practice targets. Though of dubious accuracy and prone to failure in rainy weather, these experiments have still provided some valuable lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_2076;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] is trying out [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHis] new plan to get rid of intruders. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] has been splashing soap on all of the floors to make it more hazardous to move around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_2077;There's litter and feathers all over the place and when you enter the dining hall you see a huge pelican standing on the table. When [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] sees my steaming face [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHe] tries to calm me down, introducing me to the new 'Pelican Guard'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_4020;You receive a report from the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a large steel-plated chariot was constructed, propelled by ten men inside pulling it forward, directed by a commander peering out from a revolving turret mounted on top. This vehicle also had several ballistas firing through arrow slits. Unfortunately, its weight caused a wooden bridge to collapse when crossing and the invention was lost in the river, also killing the engineer. The [Root.GetMarshalName] [Root.job_marshal.GetHerselfHimself] barely escaped with [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_4030;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a new kind of self-propelled arrow was tried out, based on Far Eastern models. Lit by fire, these arrows would scream and fly away leaving a trail of smoke and then explode on impact, killing several of the livestock used as practice targets. Unfortunately, on the second trial, several of these missiles misfired, one striking the engineer dead and another nearly killing the [Root.GetMarshalName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_4000;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4010;You shall have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4020;I'm glad something came out of the investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4040;Trumpets? How much did I pay for this again...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4050;It seems we'll be dining roast mutton...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4100;A traitor cannot be [Root.GetMarshalName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4120;[Root.job_marshal.GetSheHeCap] has forfeited [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] office!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_4000;No, I have other candidates in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_4010;No, this is pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_4020;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_4100;Ill tidings, but I still need [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_4120;I will deal with this later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
