EVTDESC88750;Your master, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], has come forward in private with a suggestion that you, as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] [Root.Liege.GetLordSpiritualName], issue a fatwa against [From.GetTitledName]. No doubt the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] own motives for this, but it cannot be denied that [From.GetFirstName] leads a decadent lifestyle with little room for piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88751;Esteemed [Root.GetTitle], I have taken your suggestion into consideration, and after much thought I have arrived at the same conclusion as you. A fatwa will be issued.\n\nYour faithful servant,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88752;Your decadent ways and lack of devotion to Allah (glorified and exalted be He) can no longer be tolerated. After consulting with my master, [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], I have reached the conclusion that a fatwa must be issued against you. May you return to the path of righteousness before it is too late.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88753;My [Root.GetTitle], I must object to this shameful attempt on your part to invoke the will of Allah (glorified and exalted be He) in your petty feud. There will be no fatwa that you can take advantage of to further your own ambitions.\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88754;You put forward the name of [From.GetTitledName] to your [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName], with the not so subtle suggestion that [From.GetSheHe] may be deserving of a fatwa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA88750;Very well, the fatwa shall be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88752;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88753;You will come to regret this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88754;For the sake of our children, if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB88750;No, their squabbling does not concern me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP88750;You suggest someone deserving of a fatwa to your [From.GetMyLordSpiritualName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP88751;Informed about fatwa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP88753;Informed fatwa will not be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
