EVTDESC60000;My liege, vague rumors of an all-conquering menace have reached us from the far East. It seems that a Great Khan has united all the tribes of the vast steppes, leading millions of fierce horse warriors against the great cities of Cathay. In time, this new Khagan could pose a threat to the civilized world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60001;My liege, the great Khagan has dispatched a numberless horde of barbarian horsemen against the lands of Central Asia and Eastern Persia. Appearing in Balkh, the heathen armies seem intent on conquering the Muslim world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60002;My liege, another horde has been sent west by the terrible Khagan of the Mongols. This one - the 'Golden Horde' - has allegedly been ordered to conquer Europe all the way to the Atlantic Ocean!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60003;My liege, the great Khan Timur has gathered many of the horse clans of Central Asia under his banner, intent on creating an empire to rival that of the legendary Genghis Khan himself. His fearsome horde has been sighted in Khiva, poised to overrun the ancient realm of Persia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60004;The Great Khagan has sent more warriors to aid our conquest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60010;The great [Root.GetTitledName] and all [Root.GetHerHis] vassals have converted and embraced the [catholic.GetName] faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60011;The great [Root.GetTitledName] and all [Root.GetHerHis] vassals have converted and embraced the Orthodox faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60012;The great [Root.GetTitledName] and all [Root.GetHerHis] vassals have converted and embraced the Sunni faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60013;The great [Root.GetTitledName] and all [Root.GetHerHis] vassals have converted and embraced the Shiite faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60014;The great [Root.GetTitledName] and all [Root.GetHerHis] vassals have converted and embraced Nestorian Christianity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60100;The Mongol scourge has poured through the Golden Gates of Kiev and sacked the once proud trading hub. The city has been left a smoldering ruin and the Dnieper now runs red with the blood of its former inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60101;Novgorod has been stormed by the Tartar horde and both the city and its population are now suffering beyond measure. The Cathedral of Saint Sophia is engulfed in flames as the steppe warriors loot that which can be carried away and put the rest to the torch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60102;The Mongols continue their push beyond the Vistula and into Poland. Krakow has now fallen to the invaders, and it is said that at night the flames from the burning city can be seen from untold leagues away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60103;Even Aachen, the former seat of Charlemagne's great Carolingian empire, has fallen under the shadow of the Mongol scourge. His spirit must surely be weeping at the atrocities now being committed within the city's walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60104;Like a swarm of locusts, the unstoppable Mongols have descended upon Paris and sacked the city. The still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral is quickly set on fire and with the light provided by the rest of the burning city, the Mongol warriors can continue looting and murdering well into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60105;Not even the sea has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt the Mongol advance. London has fallen to their vanguard and the city is now the scene of a slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60106;Once more Rome suffers at the cruel hands of eastern barbarians. The Mongols have breached the Aurelian Walls, and their horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while they raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill. As expected, no mercy is shown to those Romans who have not yet fled the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60107;The canals of Venice have been blocked by the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by frenzied Mongol warriors. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter claim the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for the Mongols to ride to and from the mainland as they please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60108;The Theodosian Walls have not been enough to spare Constantinople from the vile touch of the Tartar scourge. The great imperial capital has been sacked, its citizens butchered or enslaved, the Hagia Sophia defiled and the Great Palace of the emperors put to the torch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60109;The Mongols have now reached as far west as Lisbon in their conquests. While the city burns at their touch, the steppe warriors look out over the great blue expanse of the Atlantic. Who can tell where they will turn next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60110;Smolensk has been swallowed up by the Mongol hordes as they continue their relentless advance to the west. When the great host finally moves on, little remains of the city but ashes and charred rubble, and those lucky few inhabitants who somehow escaped the notice of the rampaging horsemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60111;The city of Prague has become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as the Mongol barbarians move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted. A flood of refugees spread horrific tales about the cruelty of the bloodthirsty Tartar horsemen to every corner of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60112;Vienna, a city of growing importance on the Danube river, has become the latest victim of the Mongol hordes as they continue to pillage and burn their way across Europe. The smoking ruins and arrow-riddled corpses they leave behind when they move on do not lend much faith in the city's future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60113;The Mongols have reached beyond the Carpathians and fanned out across the Great Hungarian Plain. Now the city of Esztergom has fallen to the murderous host and is the scene of indiscriminate slaughter. Those that attempt to flee on foot are cut down without mercy by the fast horsemen as dark, billowing smoke rises towards the sky above the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60114;The ancient city of Athens has fallen to the Mongols, and they now rampage unchecked behind its walls. Great monuments and artifacts dating back to the dawn of Western Civilisation are lost forever in a cultural desecration that will surely be felt by future generations thousands of years from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60115;The "White City" has turned red as the Mongol invaders seize Belgrade and massacre the inhabitants without exception. After several days of slaughter and looting, the smell of death and rotting flesh proves too much even for the Mongols to bear and they move their camp upwind from the scorched ruins of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60116;The great city of Baghdad, one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the ravenous Mongol hordes after a siege. Nothing can sate their appetite for destruction it seems. The Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60117;Damascus, the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by the advancing Mongols. They have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed "burj al-ru'us" by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60118;The Tartar infidels have sacked Jerusalem, spurring a moment of rare solidarity between members of all the city's different religions as they suffer equal horrors under the cruel yoke of the pagans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60119;Not content with their vast empire surpassing Alexander the Great's in sheer size, the Mongol hordes are now laying waste to the city that is his namesake as well. Pompey's Pillar has been toppled, but at least the Pharos Lighthouse is spared when the Mongols deem it not worth the great effort it would require to raze it to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60120;Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, the Tartar hordes have arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of Cairo. Surely even the cruelest Pharaoh would be given pause by the pain and misery now inflicted on the city's hapless population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60121;The Holy City of Mecca now burns at the cruel touch of the Mongol infidels. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This unforgivable desecration will be remembered for ages to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60200;A young warrior, Seljuk, son of Toqaq of the Iron Bow of the Kinik tribe, has become something of a legend after performing several astounding feats of valor. I feel compelled to give this remarkable man a place at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60201;My men are restless and my ambitions must no longer be delayed. I must choose a juicy target and call my tribe to war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60204;My tribe, the fighting Kinik, stand behind me as I set out to conquer [From.Duchy.GetFullBaseName]. Let [From.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName] tremble in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60205;[From.GetBestName], perhaps the most able warrior in my realm, has called his tribe and many other hopefuls to war, declaring his intention to take the [FromFrom.Duchy.GetFullBaseName] from [FromFrom.Holder.TopLiege.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60206;In the steppes of Central Asia, a great warrior has emerged as the leader of the Kinik tribe of the Oghuz Turks, demonstrating his brilliance by winning a war against the mighty [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. Other tribes have taken notice and warriors of all stripes are flocking to his banners in great numbers. Seljuk Khan has promised them a fortune in plunder in his future conquests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60207;Turkish warriors from the homeland keep arriving in great numbers, hoping to serve in the armies of the great Seljuk's successor. With men such as these, I can accomplish anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60300;A brilliant horseman and daring raider by the name of Timur has distinguished himself several times now. My commanders all agree that I should give this remarkable young man a chance to prove himself as a leader, clubfoot or no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60304;As I've fought for my liege I have gathered a large and loyal following, brave horsemen all. Rather than rise up against my old liege, I've decided to strike out for [From.Duchy.GetFullBaseName]. Let [From.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName] tremble in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60306;Another great Khan is on the rise in Central Asia. Timur, called 'the Lame' due to his clubfoot, has proven himself to the Turco-Mongol tribes of the region. He seems intent on creating an empire to rival that of the legendary Genghis Khan himself, as he has just finished crushing [FromFrom.GetTitledName] in a brutal war. Tens of thousands of skilled horsemen have gathered under his banner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60307;Horsemen from the great steppes keep arriving in great numbers, hoping to serve in the armies of Timur Khan's successor. With warriors like these, I can accomplish anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60400;A brilliant Turkish mercenary and former slave warrior by the name of Sabuktigin has distinguished himself many times, leading his company of horsemen in battle and raids. My commanders think I should give him a more prominent position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60406;A former Turkish mercenary and slave soldier is on the rise in the land of the Afghans. This Sabuktigin, a zealous man who loathes infidels, seems intent on creating an empire to rival that of the Caliphs of old, as he has just finished crushing [FromFrom.GetTitledName] in a brutal war. Tens of thousands of fierce tribesmen have gathered under his banner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60500;Word has reached us that an ambitious Khan from beyond the great mountains has set out to unite the clans of the great steppe. It is also said by men who read the stars that this Khan is destined to become the ruler of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60520;The many Khans of the steppe have been rallied under the same banner. The leader that managed to unite them all is [From.GetFirstName] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The people of the steppe now call their leader Genghis Khan, Greatest of Khans, and have set their minds not only on ruling the steppes but to spread throughout the world. Is there anyone who can stop the thundering armies of thousands of hooves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA60000;A fine tale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60010;The time has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60100;Perhaps the stories were true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60101;Perhaps their bloodlust has been sated now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60102;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60103;Barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60104;There seems to be no reprieve from these accursed Tartars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60105;God save us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60106;Is this the end of days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60107;Surely that can't be true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60108;May God have mercy on their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60109;Is there no place beyond their reach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60110;Such butchery will not go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60111;Have they no regard for culture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60112;There will come a time of reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60113;May it be the last city the Tartars take!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60114;This time they have gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60115;They will be the end of us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60116;Like raging wolves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60117;May they suffer a thousand deaths for their crimes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60118;Infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60119;May they suffer an eternity of pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60120;Have they no shame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60121;Not a single infidel taking part in this affront will escape justice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60200;He bears watching...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60201;Merv is best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60204;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60205;He will be missed, but I wish him luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60206;This is only the beginning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60207;Seljuk would be proud of his heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60300;A potential rival?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60305;As long as he does not turn on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60306;I am Temujin reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60307;The Iron Khan would be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60401;Gandhara is best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60406;Infidels beware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60500;What could those equestrians hope to accomplish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_60520;I truly am great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB60001;Allah have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60002;God preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60003;Is there no end to these steppe warriors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60010;Allah have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60100;They will not come here, Inshallah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60101;May the snows of the frozen north claim them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60102;These horsemen know how to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60103;Their walls were not strong enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60104;Not even the Franks deserve such a fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60105;Impressive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60106;So not even fabled Rome can stand against them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60107;A city floating on water?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60108;Ar-Rum is no longer a threat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60109;Their reach seems unlimited...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60110;Disconcerting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60111;A waste, by the Prophet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60112;Is this what we can expect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60115;Barbaric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60116;Let us pray the Mongols are swallowed up by the desert now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60117;It will fall on those of the True Faith to stop the Tartar scourge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60118;Heathens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60119;Would that I could follow in Alexander's footsteps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60120;But who is left to tax?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60121;God forbid this scourge continues west...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60201;Khorasan seems natural;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60206;He is a credit to all Turks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60306;He is a credit to all Mongols!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60401;Multan seems natural;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60406;What a troubled region that is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60500;That should be nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_60520;Something has to be done to stop them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC60001;The Mahometans had it coming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60002;Time for the Infidel to suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60010;God have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60201;Dihistan is rich and weak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60206;Turkish khans come and go...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60306;These horselords sure are persistent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60401;Lahore is rich and weak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60500;No-one will rule over our people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_60520;[From.GetFirstName] truly is the Greatest of Khans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD60001;The Mongol gods are strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD60002;The Mongol gods are strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD60010;May the Gods save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD60201;Samarkand first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD60401;Bhakkar first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE60201;Balkh... yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
