EVTDESC_HF_42000_DIPLOMACY;I have often noticed how [sway_target.GetFirstName] seem to make awkward weird mistakes in diplomatic encounters. I have a couple of books on the matter, and [sway_target.GetSheHe] would probably be happy with my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42000_INTRIGUE;All kinds of rumors have been spreading about [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] recently. Does [sway_target.GetSheHe] have no understanding of how to cultivate a proper image? Someone need to help [sway_target.GetHerHim] out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42000_LEARNING;I came across an assertion written by [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName], and though it is well written, I have ideas for how it could be improved. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42000_MARTIAL;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s men have outdated drilling routines, and it is almost embarrassing to see them in action. I could send him some books, or maybe some commanders, to help [sway_target.GetHerHim] get [sway_target.GetHerHis] men up to date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42000_STEWARDSHIP;I just heard about an absolutely atrocious business deal made at the behest of [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]. I could spend some time to help [sway_target.GetHerHim] out, or send some scribes over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42001_DIPLOMACY;I received a letter and a package from [From.GetTitledFirstName], where [From.GetSheHe] recommends me to take a look through the books [From.GetSheHe] sent me. They seem to be mostly focused around politics and negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42001_INTRIGUE;A short and concise letter has been sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName], where [From.GetSheHe] discusses the recent rumors which have been spread about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42001_LEARNING;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me a long letter about how I could improve my writing, and get a better understanding of more difficult scientific subjects. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42001_MARTIAL;A large burly man has been sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to help train my soldiers. For some reason they think they are better at exercising my men than I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42001_STEWARDSHIP;A couple of scribes has been sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. They say they would like to help me govern my realm and aid with business deals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42002_DIPLOMACY;I have noted a difference in the day to day political life recently, as I have started to find it a lot easier to simply converse with my courtiers and political allies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42002_INTRIGUE;Whatever rumors might have been floating around, seem to have dissipated the last month, and my own rumormongers have effectively spread a better image of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42002_LEARNING;I found myself reading some of the more obscure, older books from the library. I have always been somewhat skeptical of these books, but they are not actually that bad after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42002_MARTIAL;My men look sharper and more ready for war than ever, and I feel ready to lead them to war. I would not have expected anything akin to this, just a couple of weeks ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42002_STEWARDSHIP;Money has been flowing the last month as every business deal I do seem to go in my favor, and my people seem happier than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42003;I certainly worked hard for my recent accomplishments, but a lot of people have been saying it is because of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] help. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42004;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me a letter with [sway_target.GetHerHis] thanks for all my work recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42005_DIPLOMACY;With every passing day I feel like things are degrading politically, and the court life is getting ever harsher. [From.GetTitledFirstName] said [From.GetSheHe] wanted to help, but I expected things to get better, not worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42005_INTRIGUE;I keep hearing more distasteful rumors spread about me by the day. If [From.GetTitledFirstName] wanted to help out, this is clearly not having the effect we wanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42005_LEARNING;I start questioning my writing, and I have lost all interest in reading. I know [From.GetTitledFirstName] probably wanted to help, but it is having an adverse effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42005_MARTIAL;My men look at me with scornful eyes. Whatever [From.GetTitledFirstName] wanted to help me with, this is clearly not having a positive effect on the men. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42005_STEWARDSHIP;Money seem to disappear, and I have started worrying if the so-called help [From.GetTitledFirstName] sent me was a ploy to trick me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42006;A lot of people has blamed me for the recent chaos that has been happening around the court, but was it not [From.GetTitledFirstName] who originally wanted to help out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42007;There has been a lot of chaos at [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s court recently. My courtiers suddenly approached me with a letter today, where the ungrateful bastard blames me for the recent chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42008_DIPLOMACY;There has not been much of a change around court since I started following [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s advices, but I still feel somewhat more confident in my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42008_INTRIGUE;The worst of the rumors have disappeared, though there is still some murmuring around the court. I have a feeling things will go better from here on though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42008_LEARNING;I have tried following [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s advices when it comes to my writing, but I am just not sure I see that much of a difference to the end result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42008_MARTIAL;My men look more or less like they always have. Though we have started following [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s suggestions, there does not to be much of a change. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42008_STEWARDSHIP;Though I have a feeling business have gone somewhat better recently, it is hard to see much of a difference, though I am grateful for the help I have been given by [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42009;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] not only did not accept my help, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] was furious that I dared presume [sway_target.GetSheHe] needed any kind of aid in the first place. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42020;I think inviting [sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] to an activity we can do together would help us grow closer, but I am not entirely sure what kind of activity I should suggest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] in a dueling tournament, where [From.GetSheHe] need a partner. This could be an opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] for a board game evening. This could be a good opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to join [From.GetHerHim] on a hunt. This could be an opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_SCHOLAR;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to an upcoming discussion. I might learn something about both the discussed subject and get to know [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_SOCIAL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation for an upcoming banquet. This is probably a good opportunity to get to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_STEWARD;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to a local festival at [From.Capital.GetName]. It would be a good opportunity to get to know [From.GetHerHim] better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42021_TORTURE;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me an invitation to what I assume is torture of [From.GetHerHis] prisoners. This could be a chance to get to know each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_DUEL;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to join the tournament, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to spare at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_GAME;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the board game evening, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to spare at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_HUNT;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to join a hunt, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to join at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_SCHOLAR;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the discussion, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_SOCIAL;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the banquet, but [sway_target.GetSheHe] does not have the time for something frivolous like that at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_STEWARD;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation to the local festival, but sadly [sway_target.GetSheHe] cannot find them to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42022_TORTURE;[sway_target.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the invitation, but was not interested in joining right now. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] looks excited as the first rounds of the tournament starts. I brandish my blade, and am ready as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] inquires about the nature of the game we will play, as the other attendees readies the board. A game about warfare is fitting for rulers like us, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gives me a smile, as we start walking into the local forests around [Root.Capital.GetName]. I have been waiting for this for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_SCHOLAR;[From.GetFirstName] is the last one to arrive to the discussion. The conversation flows freely between everyone, jumping from topic to topic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_SOCIAL;I receive [From.GetTitledFirstName] at the door, and help [From.GetHerHim] inside. [From.GetSheHeCap] look around the large room, and give me an approving nod of the size of the banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_STEWARD;All kinds of sights can be seen as we walk through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Masked jugglers and people having fun all around us. I decide to show [From.GetHerHim] the local hedge-maze, to top it off. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42023_TORTURE;I happily guide [From.GetFirstName] down the stairs to the dungeon, as soon as [From.GetSheHe] gets to [Root.Capital.GetName]. We have a lot of fine specimen here in [Root.Capital.GetName], and this is a prime opportunity to test them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_DUEL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] expertly fences us through the first rounds of the tournament, it is clear [From.GetSheHe] has a lot of prior experience with fencing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] helps me ready for the event, and explains the game to me. Though there is some details still unclear to me, [From.GetFirstName] promises to help me out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_HUNT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] expertly guides us through the forests. It is clear [From.GetSheHe] knows this area well. [From.GetFirstName] tells me we are looking for a wild boar that has been sighted in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_SCHOLAR;[From.GetTitledFirstName] receives me at the door, and helps me get seated in the tiny room. The discussion quickly switches between different and difficult topics, and I am just trying to keep up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_SOCIAL;[From.GetTitledFirstName] receives me at the door, and invites me inside. The banquet is larger than I originally expected, with nice looking lords and ladies all across the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_STEWARD;All kinds of sites can be seen at [From.Capital.GetName]. [From.GetFirstName] shows me around the city happily, and we have a lot of fun as we come across all kinds of entertainers and events. In the end [From.GetSheHe] brings me to a local hedge-maze. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42024_TORTURE;As soon as I get to [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] receives me at the door, and brings me down to the dungeon. We walk past all kinds of people, looking downtrodden and like they have been through [From.GetHerHis] torture before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_DUEL;We pass through all the preliminary rounds with little to no issue. In the last round we are facing two large ogre looking men, the swords tiny in their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_GAME;As the game develops, [From.GetFirstName] and I end up partnering up. I can already see that one of us will have to sacrifice all of their units, to be able to get a win. [From.GetFirstName] does not seem to have noticed this yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_HUNT;Hours pass with little to no excitement, when suddenly we come across the boar we were looking for. My soldiers look at me, waiting for my orders to wait it out or to hunt it down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_SCHOLAR;Some hours pass as the discussions continue. We come to an impasse about the nature of the universe, with [From.GetFirstName] and I together at one side of the discussion. [From.GetSheHeCap] looks at me, clearly waiting for me to make the first line of reasoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_SOCIAL;Several hours passes, and [From.GetFirstName] seem to enjoy [From.GetHerselfHimself]. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] would enjoy [From.GetHerselfHimself] even more if we managed to find [From.GetHerHim] some company for the night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_STEWARD;At the start we are having fun as we walk through the hedge-maze, but at some point I start losing track of where we are. I get to a cross-road, and I am not sure which path I have to take to get us out. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42025_TORTURE;We start testing out the different tools we have at hand, and quickly work our way through a couple of the prisoners. They almost look spiffy after we are done with them, and I have to say, we are being quite generous as we leave them mostly intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_DUEL;We finally reach the finale of the tournament, and our last opponents are two large men. [From.GetFirstName] rush in from the start, and stay on the offensive against both of the two men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_GAME;The game is starting to develop into a bloodbath, as the armies are clashing together. [From.GetFirstName] seem to set [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a horrible position, though it leaves an opening for me to take out a lot of our opponents' units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_HUNT;We come across the boar we have been looking for, and [From.GetFirstName] rush in and attack the wild animal without a word. The wild animal turn around, and charge at [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_SCHOLAR;Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] starts aggressively making [From.GetHerHis] arguments. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_SOCIAL;I am having fun as the evening turns to night. [From.GetFirstName] aggressively pairs me up with one guest after another, it is almost like [From.GetSheHe] is trying to get me some company for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_STEWARD; I start wondering if we have gotten lost as we walk through the hedge-maze, but [From.GetFirstName] confidently keeps up the pace. Is the hedge-maze really that big, or is [From.GetFirstName] terrified of telling me [From.GetSheHe] does not know the way out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42026_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and starts mercilessly torture the individual, pulling it through the rack. If this keeps up for much longer, I am sure the individual will break in no time. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_DUEL;We finally reach the finale of the tournament, and our last opponents are two large men. [From.GetFirstName] wait them out, and dodge back and forth, apparently trying to tire them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_GAME;The game is starting to develop into a bloodbath, as the armies are clashing together. There seems to have been some sort of miscommunication between [From.GetFirstName] and myself, as I have been put in a terrible position where most of my units are getting slaughtered, whereas [From.GetSheHe] is holding [From.GetHerHis] units back. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_HUNT;We come across the boar we have been looking for, but [From.GetFirstName] does not give the order to engage. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] is waiting it out, unsure what to do or is just being a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_SCHOLAR;Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] let the other side speak their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_SOCIAL;I am having fun as the evening turns to night. [From.GetFirstName] seem to be a pretty content host, occasionally bringing people over to talk to me. Should a host not be a bit more assertive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_STEWARD;Some minutes pass, and [From.GetFirstName] admits we seem to have gotten lost in the large hedge-maze. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks me for my thoughts, on how we should try to get out of here. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42027_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and puts the individual at a Judas cradle. Every five minutes [From.GetFirstName] lowers the individual a bit further down on the device, making small talk as [From.GetSheHe] proceeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_DUEL_FAILURE;After a long dance of steel back and forth, I finally have to admit defeat to our two opponents, and so do [From.GetFirstName]. Both teams fought well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_DUEL_SUCCESS;Though the two lumbering men fought for their lives, they finally give up and fall to the ground exhausted. I look over at [From.GetFirstName] and cheer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_GAME_FAILURE;Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, the last of [From.GetFirstName] and my units finally fall to our opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_GAME_SUCCESS;Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, [From.GetFirstName] and I finally crush our remaining opponents between our two armies. Thankfully, [From.GetFirstName] understood what I wanted us to do. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_HUNT_FAILURE;Though we fight valiantly and the beast look weakened, it flees as I am about to land the final strike. Our retainers look for it, but it cannot be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_HUNT_SUCCESS;Though the boar fought valiantly, we finally bring the beast down, to loud cheers from all our retainers. It has been a good hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SCHOLAR_FAILURE;The discussion continues on into the night, but we slowly lose point by point. In the end, there is no doubt that we have lost the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SCHOLAR_SUCCESS;The discussion continues on into the night, but the other side yield their points one by one. In the end, there is no doubt that [From.GetFirstName] and I are the undisputed winners of the discussion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SOCIAL_FAILURE;I wake up with a massive headache, and [From.GetFirstName] had apparently already left the premises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_SOCIAL_SUCCESS;I wake up half-dressed, clothes strewn everywhere with a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] sleeping besides me. I can see [From.GetFirstName] with a grin on [From.GetHerHis] face, lying on the floor with a [From.GetManWomanPreference] on top of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_STEWARD_FAILURE;Several hours pass as we keep walking around the hedge-maze, and [From.GetFirstName] is getting increasingly annoyed at the prospect at spending the night here. Finally my retainers decide to come look for us, and help us find the way out again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_STEWARD_SUCCESS;We turn a corner, and finally find the exit. I let out a small chuckle, as I confidently shows [From.GetFirstName] that we have indeed gotten out of here. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_TORTURE_FAILURE;Several of the specimen broke as we conducted our experiments on them, and I find it hard not to consider this whole ordeal a personal failure, and apologize profusely to [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42028_TORTURE_SUCCESS;I am certain this was a massive success, as most of our specimen stayed intact throughout the tests we did. Not to mention all the fun we had. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_DUEL_FAILURE;After a long tiresome fight, [From.GetFirstName] and I finally have to admit defeat to the two men. We did our best, but was outdone by their strength and speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_DUEL_SUCCESS;[From.GetFirstName] dodge several blows, before striking the last standing man several times. The two lumbering men give up, and our win is assured. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_GAME_FAILURE;After several hours, the last of our units finally fall to our opponents. [From.GetFirstName] give me a small shrug, as we sit back and think about what we could have done to win. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_GAME_SUCCESS;After several hours, the last of our opponents' units finally fall. [From.GetFirstName] gives me a small nod of approval, as we sit back and enjoy our well fought victory. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_HUNT_FAILURE;As we think the beast is finally about to give up, it suddenly ups and charges at [From.GetFirstName], and manage to flee. No matter how much our retainers look for it, they are unable to track it down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_HUNT_SUCCESS;The beast fell to the ground from all the wounds, and all the retainers let out a loud cheer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SCHOLAR_FAILURE;We slowly lose point by point, every argument we make turned against us. In the end, we have to yield to the opposing side, and there is no doubt we have lost the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SCHOLAR_SUCCESS;We slowly win point by point, both [From.GetFirstName] and I defusing every argument made by the opposing side. In the end we are the undisputed victors of the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SOCIAL_FAILURE;I wake up with a massive headache, and there is barely anyone around. When I leave, [From.GetFirstName] still seems to be asleep. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_SOCIAL_SUCCESS;It was quite the event, and as the guests are leaving the premises they are talking about how much fun they had. [From.GetFirstName] still seem to be asleep as I am leaving. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_STEWARD_FAILURE;Several hours pass, and there is no sign of the exit. Every crossroad feels like I have seen it before, and it is increasingly looking like we are going to have to spend the night in here. In the end, one of [From.GetFirstName]'s retainers come in and helps us find the way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_STEWARD_SUCCESS;We walk for a couple of minutes, and suddenly come across the exit to the maze, where all our retainers are waiting for us. This could have been a lot worse, all things considered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_TORTURE_FAILURE;[From.GetFirstName] is clearly distraught and unhappy about the results of the torture. [From.GetSheHeCap] starts apologizing, though I am not entirely sure why.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42029_TORTURE_SUCCESS;[From.GetFirstName] seems happy about all the torture [From.GetSheHe] has done. I am not entirely sure what to feel, but as long as [From.GetFirstName] considers it a success all is good, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_DUEL;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] is about to leave [From.GetSheHe] thanks me for the invitation to the tournament. It seems my plan worked out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_GAME;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] is about to leave [From.GetSheHe] thanks me for the invitation to the board game evening. I feel we have grown somewhat closer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_HUNT;As we are about to part ways, [From.GetTitledFirstName] thank me profusely for the invitation to the hunt. I can assuredly say we have grown closer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_SCHOLAR;As people start to leave the room, [From.GetFirstName] tells me how much fun [From.GetSheHe] has had throughout the discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_SOCIAL;I receive a letter from [From.GetFirstName], thanking me for the invitation to the banquet, explaining in great detail how much fun [From.GetSheHe] had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_STEWARD;As [From.GetSheHe] readies to leave [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetFirstName] tells me how much fun the festival was, and I also feel like we have grown somewhat closer after the incident in the maze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42030_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] seems to have had fun with our little experiments, and talks about how [From.GetSheHe] would like to be invited back again some time. I do feel we have grown somewhat closer throughout our little ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_DUEL;We are both exhausted after the last fight, [From.GetTitledFirstName] seem annoyed and leave without any parting words. I guess [From.GetSheHe] did not have as much fun as I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_GAME;[From.GetTitledFirstName] seem somewhat disappointed in how the evening progressed. My plan does not seem to have worked that well after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_HUNT;We part ways silently, [From.GetTitledFirstName] looking somewhat sullen. I guess it did not really work out the way I had hoped after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_SCHOLAR;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the experience, but still seem somewhat disappointed and left in a hurry. I guess it was not that fun after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_SOCIAL;I have still not received any response from [From.GetFirstName] after the banquet. Seems like my plan did not work as I had hoped after all, maybe I need to try again later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_STEWARD;[From.GetTitledFirstName] leaves without a word as soon as we get out of the maze. [From.GetSheHeCap] did not seem too pleased about the whole incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_42031_TORTURE;[From.GetFirstName] seem somewhat taken aback, but thanks me for the opportunity to join. And mentions that [From.GetSheHe] would like to never be invited again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_42000_DIPLOMACY;I will happily share the things I know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42000_INTRIGUE;A proper image is the first step to quell court intricacies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42000_LEARNING;I will send a letter to explain how [sway_target.GetSheHe] could improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42000_MARTIAL;A commander will get those soldiers up scratch in no time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42000_STEWARDSHIP;Let us make sure that does not happen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42001;If [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] can help, I am willing to give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42002;My hard work is paying off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_42003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] certainly helped, and I will send a letter with my gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
