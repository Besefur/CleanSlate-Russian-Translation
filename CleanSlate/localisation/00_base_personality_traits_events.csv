EVTDESC1000;A pretty wench is throwing herself at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1001;The cook has prepared a fine meal, but the priest preached about temperance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1002;The cook had prepared a magnificent meal, with lots of different fruits, various kinds of meat, plenty of freshly baked bread and several mature cheeses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1003;After giving my advice on a delicate matter, the courtier asked me to accept a small gift of gold as thanks for my help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1004;Work can be tedious and when one problem is solved another one pops up. I tire of having to complete the same tasks over and over again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1005;Her hair is always perfect, men love her charm and looks but she is also intelligent and well-spoken. She has been blessed with beauty, intelligence and success in all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1006;It feels like everyone is trying to trump me! My huntsman killed more prey than I, my councillors found a better solution to the rebellious peasants than mine and I started to feel that everyone was better than I am, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1007;I don't think it was meant to hurt me, but the criticism still stung harder than it should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1008;I took a good look at myself and thought about my weaknesses and strengths. After many hours of soul-searching, I realized:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1009;It was one of those situations where you didn't want to tell the truth in case it would hurt the person, but in the same time, honesty is a virtue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010;I imagined a situation which became more and more intimidating, with an outcome that could mean life or death. I swallowed hard and decided that I would...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1011;It started as an uneasiness around guests and strangers, then evolved into awkwardness and a strong feeling of discomfort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1012;I could strive to become better, or I can be satisfied with who I am and what I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1013;If my opinion ruled, the world would be a more chaotic but fun place. If I keep following the laws, the world would have less chaos but also be less fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1014;If there is a God, why is the world filled with hardships, grief and heretics?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1015;The court is filled with young, beautiful men and the attention they give me is making it hard for me to refuse them. Who wouldn't want one of them in their bed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1016;Lately I have become afraid that someone might want to hurt me. I am thinking about hiring a, no, two food-tasters and... maybe a bodyguard would be a good idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1017;After I had made another courtier cry, the third one in a short week, I felt a bit embarrassed. Is this really who I am, a cruel [Root.GetManWoman] who likes to hurt people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1018;Men have never interested me, and my awkward attempts to find out if another woman feels like I do has always ended with insulted or apprehensive looks. But today, a woman tried to seduce me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1019;I realized when I was rather young that I would never find a woman attractive. The comfort and love I saw couples share felt out of my reach, until I met a man who felt as I did...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1028;It seems the young women no longer have the power to seduce me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1029;Something I thought I had suppressed and finally subdued has risen inside me. Unchaste thoughts have begun to appear in my mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1030;A diet of bread and water does not satisfy me any more. I need something else, something delicious and filling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1031;I no longer find joy in stuffing myself with fine wines, red meat and rich sauces. I think I need a diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1032;Today in the market, I watched as a poor beggar took his bowl full of coins and went straight into the tavern to buy drink. Perhaps mankind is unlovable after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1033;Money didn't make me happy, nor did respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1034;Work has become boring and the hours of the day drag on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1035;I feel spirited and restless. Maybe some work might calm me down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1036;I am sick of always being kind to everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1037;I should be happy with what I've got, not everyone is as privileged as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1038;I have started to feel that 'turn the other cheek' is just stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1039;The constant surges of adrenaline and increased heart rate makes me weary. It's not as fun being angry as it used to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1040;I am pretty great, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1041;'Tis hard to feel proud when one has nothing to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1042;I have grown tired of the young men who try to seduce me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1043;Sometimes, it's easier to lie than to hurt people with a truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1044;Lies do hurt people. The truth... I think I can handle the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1045;I did not understand fear before, but once you have felt your leg shake and teeth chatter with fear, then it is hard to remain brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1046;Fear has loosened its grip on me, and I stand tall against the things I used to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1047;I crave solitude, I no longer seek the company of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1048;My confidence has grown and I don't feel so awkward anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1049;There must be more to life than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1050;I have trumped everyone and am the best [From.GetTitle] ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1051;Justice is a harsh mistress and I can't love her anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1052;Someone told me I'm arbitrary and I wish to change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1053;My favorite subject does not interest me anymore and I can't speak about it with the same zeal as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1054;Perhaps the glass is fuller than I believed it to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1057;The feeling of being watched and followed seem to have disappeared overnight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1058;Several assassinations and 'loans' later, I don't know if I'm still able to trust anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1060;The glance was intentional lascivious and the [Root.GetManWomanOpp] did not hide [Root.GetHerHisOpp] appreciation, nor hide [Root.GetHerHisOpp] lustful thoughts and invited me to join [Root.GetHerHimOpp]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1070;As I listened to the Hafiz correctly continue the recitation of a passage taken randomly from the Qur'an, I marveled at the piety of the man. To submit the whole Qur'an to memory, all 114 Surahs, is a feat only the most zealous Muslim could perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1071;I feel nervous as I stand before the imam, waiting for him to choose and start reciting a random passage from the Qur'an which I must then continue reciting correctly. He has chosen:\n\nWhen the Qur'an is read...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1000;I can't resist her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1001;I try to eat modestly but the food is too good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1003;I accept the gift reluctantly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1004;Let someone else do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1005;Why was [Root.GetSheHe] blessed and not I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1006;If they are better than I am, then I have to accept that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1007;An eye for an eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1008;I have nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1009;Lie and don't hurt anyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010;Run awaaaayyy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1011;I don't want to meet any new people;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1012;I will never be satisfied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1013;Let my rule begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1014;God has a plan for everything and everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1015;Give in, have some fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1016;Food-tasters, bodyguards, anything that can save me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1017;Who am I kidding? I love this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1018;...and she's irresistible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1019;...and he's irresistible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1028;I just don't feel lustful anymore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1030;I have broken my fast with wine and quail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1031;Bread and water for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1032;No more charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1033;I think I need something else in my life;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1034;Diligence may be a virtue, but it's exhausting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1035;No longer lazy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1036;Feel my wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1037;Begone, envy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1038;An eye for an eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1039;I should take it easier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1040;I think I should be proud of myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1041;Why should I be proud of myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1043;Honesty can hurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1044;Truth shall set me free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1045;This does not make me a coward, does it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1046;No one can call me craven anymore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1047;...but I won't become a hermit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1048;My stuttering has disappeared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1049;And I will find it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1050;Now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1051;I am... NOT the law!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1052;Good for me, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1053;I was boring before;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1054;...as long as it does not overflow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1057;I am safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1058;Why are they trying to hurt me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1060;Follow [Root.GetHerHimOpp] to [Root.GetHerHisOpp] chambers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1070;May Allah hear my words, I will memorize the whole Qur'an!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1071;...listen to it with attention and hold your peace that ye may receive Mercy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB1000;Mind over body, mind over body...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1001;I satisfy my hunger with bread and water;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1003;Wasn't my advice worth more than a couple pennies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1004;I can rest in Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1005;It's hard not to envy her, but I am perfect as I am;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1006;I envy them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1007;I'll turn the other cheek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1008;I have many strengths, but more weaknesses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1009;Be honest and tell it as it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010;Stay put and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1011;I'll just have to try to be more gregarious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1012;I am content;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1013;Justice should always prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1014;God is as clueless as I am;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1015;A woman should suppress her worldly urges;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1016;I won't let fear rule my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1017;Oh [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], what have I done? Forgive me, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1018;As tempting as it is, I really shouldn't;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1019;I cannot give in to these feelings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1029;I can't resist him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1032;It does not make sense, but I must try to accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1060;It is forbidden!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1070;Marvelous! But it must be such a chore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
