EVTDESC_HF_10095_A;[combatant_1.GetBestName], my [other_combatant.GetRootRelation], has declared that [combatant_1.GetHerHis] claim on [target_title.GetName] cannot be ignored any longer. I am expected to meet [combatant_1.GetHerHim] in personal combat, "to once and for all settle this matter", the courier reads aloud. I can already hear the whispers through my court, if I were to decline the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10095_B;I am [GetEducationActivity], in deep conversation with a fellow [GetEducationRole], when a red-faced courier bursts in. "Your [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] [combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] is challenging you, my [Root.GetLordLady]! To personal combat, for your titles!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10096_A;I am told that the [From.GetEducationRole] [From.GetTitle] furrowed [From.GetHerHis] brows and [From.GetEducationReaction], upon hearing my proposal. "I think [From.GetSheHe] understood the humiliation [From.GetSheHe] would suffer by declining, my [Root.GetLordLady]" the courier suggests. "Clever [From.GetManWoman]", I mutter. The duel is soon to take place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10096_B;The response from [From.GetBestName] feels [From.GetPublicOpinionOfWork], and I have my advisors read through it a couple of times. Finally, they nod in agreement: "It seems [From.GetSheHe] accepts your challenge, my [Root.GetLordLady]. The duel will take place in a few nights.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_A;[other_combatant.GetBestName] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon] [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly], [other_combatant.GetButAndYet] I keep side-stepping [other_combatant.GetHerHis] attacks. "Is it worth it?!" I shout, noticing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face glistening with sweat. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] only growls in response. "So be it", I declare, raising my [Root.GetDuelWeapon]. "Meet your maker, [other_combatant.GetDuelistRelationOrInsult]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_B;"They say you are famous for your [other_combatant.GetMilitarySquadPride]", I mutter at my [other_combatant.GetRootRelation]. "It doesn't seem to saving you this time, does it?" I am swinging my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] [Root.GetClumsilyElegantly], [Root.GetButAndYet] my opponent has a hard time getting a single attack to land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_C;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] should have known better. "What were you thinking?" I ask, genuinely curious, as I circle the [other_combatant.GetManWoman], occasionally striking with my [Root.GetDuelWeapon]. "You cannot win this", I declare, as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] winces again, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] wounds clearly beginning to take a serious toll on [other_combatant.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_A_attacker;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] seems unaware that the little scrape I inflicted is what is causing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] limbs to slowly go numb... "Valiant effort!" I proclaim, watching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sluggish movements. When [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lunges at me, I carefully step aside, letting [other_combatant.GetHerHis] subsequent collapse look like a failed attack. The poison must have reached [other_combatant.GetHerHis] heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_A_defender_self;"Impressive!" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] splutters, on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] knees in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc]. Finally, I let the anger fill me. "I had your weapons switched", I hiss, pressing my dagger to [other_combatant.GetHerHis] throat. "I have eyes and ears everywhere", I explain to the bewildered [other_combatant.GetManWoman]. "You thought I'd let you *poison* me?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_A_defender_spymaster;I'm not sure why my [Root.GetMySpymasterName] wants to inspect my equipment prior to the duel – surely, [job_spymaster.GetHerHis] comment about poison were in jest! Later, my performance in the fight is not my greatest accomplishment, but I honestly expected my [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] to put up more resistance. I barely have a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10103_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving sluggishly. Perhaps it's due to the special breakfast I had my agents prepare for [other_combatant.GetHerHim], but it is clear that the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is not in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] best form. Before anyone catches on, I attack with full force. It feels almost too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10104_A;I swing my [GetDuelWeapon] [GetClumsilyElegantly], [GetButAndYet] [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] keeps side-stepping my attacks. My opponent does not seem tired at all! Raising [other_combatant.GetHerHis] weapon for a final killing blow, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] suddenly pauses. "Would you heed a warning, [Root.GetFirstName]?!

"[GetClaimDuelDemand]";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10104_C;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] has spent the better part of an hour humiliating me. I am having trouble standing, my latest lunge of attack left me in the [Root.GetGroundDesc], and my face is streaked with dirt, as well as blood. "What were you thinking?" [other_combatant.GetSheHe] asks, sounding genuinely curious. "[GetClaimDuelDemand]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] finally pleads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10104_D;[other_combatant.GetPoisonForgiveness] "[GetClaimDuelDemand]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] finally pleads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_10104_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly], yet I can't even muster the strength to hold my [GetDuelWeapon] right. "You look tired, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] says, stepping closer. I want to protest, but my head is swimming. Smirking, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon], and [Root.GetKillingBlowOnMeShort].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10105_A;[From.GetBestName] sees reason! Slowly, [From.GetSheHe] picks [From.GetHerselfHimself] up, [From.GetHerHis] weapon scraping against the ground, where [From.GetSheHe] seems to leave [From.GetHerHis] spirit. Bystanders glare at the [From.GetManWoman] as [From.GetSheHe] kneels before me, mumbling: "I ask your forgiveness, my [Root.GetLordLady]".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10106_A;[From.GetBestName] refused to see reason, aghast at the very idea of [From.GetHerHim] giving up [From.GetHerHis] claim on my titles. In the end, I had no choice but to cut [From.GetHerHim] down, [From.GetHerHis] last words being a string of insults hurled at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_10106_B;[From.GetBestName] refused to see reason. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] flung [From.GetHerHis] weapon back and forth, flailing wildly, still no closer to actually injuring me – all the while shouting that [From.GetSheHe] would never kneel to me. It was with a heavy sigh that I finally sunk my weapon into [From.GetHerHis] chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10096_bloodline;[From.GetTitledName] has volunteered as my opponent. I am uncertain what [From.GetSheHe] thinks of my lineage, and judging from the whispers surrounding us as we shake hands, so is [From.GetSheHe]... "Best of luck to you both!" [hero_character.GetBestName] says, shooting [From.GetFirstName] a reassuring glance. I let go of [From.GetManWoman]'s grip, noticing the sweat of [From.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10097;The spineless [GetRootFromInsult], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has refused your challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10098;"Not so fast", a voice whispers in my ear, as I'm preparing to turn in for the night. I turn around, but something stings my throat. A dagger? "We WILL duel, dear [Root.GetFirstName], do you understand? Nod if you understand." Panic pounding in my chest, I nod, carefully as to not hurt myself further. "Good", the [From.GetManWoman] says, and pulls away into the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10099;While attempting to talk some sense into [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName], in regards to [combatant_2.GetHerHim] declining my duel, I have decided to sneak into [combatant_2.GetHerHis] [combatant_2.GetCapitalHolding].

EVTDESC_HFP_10101_clumsy;Weapon raised, I charge at [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName], but I trip on something! Flailing, I tumble over my opponent, who stares in disbelief as I pierce myself on [combatant_2.GetHerHis] weapon. Out of options, I wring my arm around the [combatant_2.GetManWoman]'s neck, [combatant_2.GetHerHis] eyes wild with horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10101_default;"It's over!" I shout, as [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName] staggers backwards, clutching at a clearly fatal wound to [combatant_2.GetHerHis] stomach. I turn to face the crowd. "Yield, or-" I continue, but my command is cut short, the taste of blood filling my mouth. My opponent drops [combatant_2.GetHerHis] bloodied [combatant_2.GetDuelWeapon], mumbling: "Now – it's over".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10101_elegant;I charge at [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName], raising my [combatant_1.GetDuelWeapon].

My mind races as my opponent turns away to accept the cheers of the crowd. My grip is wet from sweat, or blood, but I charge. "Yield, or-" [combatant_1.GetSheHe] continues, but the command is cut short, my weapon having served its purpose. Then my knees give way and it all goes dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10110_B;"No, I can still fight!" I say, dropping to my knees, sensing my own lie. Even though [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has clearly injured [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has been proclaimed the winner.

The last thing I hear is the panicked shouting of my fellow soldiers, followed by a soft thud, which can only be my head hitting the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10111_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lets out an angry grunt. Before I know it, I am begging for mercy, but [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is beyond reasoning. The last thing I hear is the shocked gasp of the crowd, and a soft thud, which can only be my head hitting the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10111_intrigue;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], when something twisted passes over [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I barely register the glint of something metal in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] hand, before my throat is cut open, blood spraying on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I try to ask why, but no words come out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10112_default;Sometimes, when I see my soldiers practicing their swordsmanship in the training grounds, the face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] flashes before my mind's eye, and I relive the duel we fought. It sends my heart racing, how I failed to defend my honor. Some days, the shame is overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10112_incapable;There are noises. Metal, clanging. A fight? Are those soldiers practicing, or is this another nightmare? The twisted face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is laughing at me, after our duel? My heart racing, I still cannot move from my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10112_mock_duel;I know that there wasn't really anything at stake during the mock duel that took place between us, yet I find myself filling with rage whenever anyone mentions [other_combatant.GetTitledName], and it's making servants flinch. But does it matter? I am the [Root.GetTitle]! Am I not allowed to loathe that [other_combatant.GetManWoman]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10113_incapable;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently slipped into a deep slumber, and does not show any signs of waking. However, I am told that the last thing anyone heard [From.GetHerHim] talking about was our duel and how [From.GetSheHe] would find a way to take revenge on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10115_battlefield_duel;I have recently found myself thinking about [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], and how [other_combatant.GetSheHe] bested me on the battlefield. I finally sent a letter, to point out the professional respect I bear for [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. Even though we were enemies, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] has been kind enough to respond, in a gleeful tone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10115_default;I have recently found myself talking with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] for hours, about [other_combatant.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. I have to laugh, however, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to compliment my fighting technique – we both know that I didn't do very well, last time we sparred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10115_mock_duel;Since the duel, I have been practicing a bit with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] did best me, and I was quick to ask for any pointers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] seemed surprised at first, but today I am proud to tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] that [other_combatant.GetSheHe]'s a good teacher. "And friend!" I add.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10116;I have recently found myself becoming friendly with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] chuckles heartily, however, when I attempt to compliment the [From.GetManWoman] on [From.GetHerHis] fighting technique. "My [Root.GetLordLady], we both know that I did not do very well, last time we sparred", [From.GetSheHe] says;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10116_battlefield_duel;I have received letters from [From.GetTitledFirstName], expressing a professional respect for my besting [From.GetHerHim] in combat. The [From.GetManWoman] is surprisingly easy to talk to about other things too, considering a part of me still remembers fighting for my life against [From.GetHerHim], at the battle of [battlefield_location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10116_default;I have recently found myself becoming friendly with [From.GetTitledFirstName].

"My [Root.GetLordLady], we both know that I did not do very well, last time we sparred", [From.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10116_mock_duel;After the duel, [From.GetTitledName] asked me for advice on fighting. A little taken aback, I happily offered to train with [From.GetHerHim], on occasion. Today, [From.GetSheHe] thanks me, for being a good teacher. "And friend," [From.GetSheHe] adds, dunking me on the back, before [From.GetSheHe] cocks [From.GetHerHis] head, in direction of the sparring grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_crush_past;I've had trouble sleeping, ever since the duel with [other_combatant.GetFirstName], and it's affecting my temper. When my councilors begged me to clarify my thoughts on a matter, I simply blurted out that "[other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry]";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_crushing_already;Ever since [other_combatant.GetFirstName] bested me in our duel, I yearn to be near [other_combatant.GetHerHim], even more than before. I'm filled with thoughts and visions of us together, yet I dare not approach [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_new_crush_A;Ever since we sparred together, I have been having daydreams, about [other_combatant.GetFirstName]. I keep seeing [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in my mind's eye, and my heart flutters. I can't tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] though... [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_new_crush_B;It's dark when I jolt awake, my heart pounding in my chest. Wiping the sweat from my brow, the memory of my dream lingers. I was dueling [other_combatant.GetFirstName] again, but instead of delivering the winning blow, this time, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] put [other_combatant.GetHerHis] arm around my waist, and pulled me in for a kiss. When will these dreams end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10118_new_crush_C;I thought I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] today, in the fighting grounds. I was wrong, and the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] was startled to find [other_combatant.GetHerHis] liege putting a hand on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] shoulder. Embarrassed, I fled. Oh, why does my heart long for [other_combatant.GetFirstName]? [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_A;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], praising both my beauty and combat prowess. "Oh", I mumble. "A love letter?" The servant who handed it to me nods. "I... I guess that [From.GetRomanticObstacle], but...", I mumble. The [Root.GetBoyGirl] shifts uncomfortably, but I am re-reading the words, over and over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_B;"Dear [Root.GetFirstName]", the letter begins. As I keep reading, I feel my ears grow hot. A love letter? From [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scratch my head. While I'm aware that [From.GetRomanticObstacle], I find my heart skipping a beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_C;"I was told to give this to you in person", the servant says, handing me a letter, with the seal of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. "I think it's a love letter, [Root.GetMasterMistress]", the [Root.GetBoyGirl] continues. "From [From.GetFirstName]?" I ask incredulously, snatching the papers from [Root.GetHerHis] hands. After reading it, I am stuck re-reading it, over and over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10119_finally_lovers;I have received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], containing a rather solemn declaration of love. Upon reading it, my eyes start stinging, and I have to sit down. [From.GetHerHisCap] words are anxious, expectant. Does [From.GetSheHe] not know how I have harbored feelings for [From.GetHerHim] too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10120_A;While awaiting news from [From.GetFirstName], I have tried occupying myself... I briefly entertained the idea of courting a visiting diplomat, but I quickly realized it was only because [From.GetHerHis] hair was the exact same shade of color as that of [From.GetFirstName]'s... It seems silly now, reading the heartfelt words my [From.GetLordLady] has sent me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10120_finally_lovers;As a servant [Root.GetBoyGirl] hands me a letter, I sigh. I've waited to hear from [From.GetFirstName] for what feels like ages, and every letter I receive in its stead feels like mockery. "What's this seal?" I mumble, suddenly curious. Soon, relief is washing over me. "[From.GetSheHeCap] wants to see me!" I laugh, and the servant smiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10121;My [GetMyChancellorName] [advisor_target.GetFirstName] clasps [advisor_target.GetHerHis] hands in a gesture of sympathy. "No, my [Root.GetLordLady], we have not received any word from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Yes, I've made inquiries among the servants, and nobody has stolen any letters..." Avoiding [advisor_target.GetHerHis] gaze, I wave my hand dismissively. "I suppose that is a response in its own.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_10196;§Y[FromFrom.GetTitledName]§! suffered an untimely death before we could see to our duel. I'll have to approach [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_10095_craven;This does not sound safe at all...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10095_ordely;No...! This is not how rules of succession should be treated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HF_10096;Now, to convene with my agents...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10096_TT;You will use any means necessary to win this duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10103_default;You brought your own death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10103_default_tt;You raise your weapon and strike the killing blow.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10103_mean;I had a feeling I would have to destroy you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10103_sad;Curse you, for making me do this...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10104;I... I will walk away while I can, [other_combatant.GetRootRelation]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10105;You have my forgiveness, [From.GetRootRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10105_TT;You extend a hand to the beaten [From.GetManWoman].\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10106;Well, that was excessive. A [From.GetManWoman], wasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_10107;I never expected this generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10001_cruel;I cannot believe [random_rival_target.GetFirstName] outlives me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10001_kind;Perhaps I should have made peace with [random_rival_target.GetFirstName]...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10001_lover;Tell [my_beloved.GetFirstName] that... that I love [my_beloved.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10096;A [GetDuelType], huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10096_CLAIM_DUEL_TT;This could seriously alter the fate of §Y[combatant_2.PrimaryTitle.GetName]§!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10096_TT;The duel will take place within the next few days.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10097;Oh, they are not getting away that easily...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10097_TT;You will attempt to corner §Y[combatant_2.GetTitledName]§!, forcing [combatant_2.GetHerHim] to accept your challenge...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10098;Is that you, [From.GetFirstName]? Oh, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I don't have a choice...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10098_TT;You gulp, as it seems you have no choice. You will duel §Y[From.GetTitledName]§!, in a few days time.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10099;I, uhm... I'm here to... Inspect the... Facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10099_TT;You make a hasty run for it, before anyone recognizes you. There will be no duel between you and §Y[combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10101_clumsy;I... Refuse... To die alone...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10101_default;No.. What did you do...?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10101_elegant;So this is how it ends. It was... My honor, [other_combatant.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10102_clumsy;Wha-! You-! Ggghrrrhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10103_default;I... yes, that was on purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10103_duelist;Another victorious match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10103_mean;Your death was the only logical outcome, [other_combatant.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10103_sad;I am sorry it had to end this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10104;It is... over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10105_cruel;Honestly, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]? This was too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10105_default;I walk away victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10108;I should have stayed and fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10108_craven;I just wanted to prove that I am not afraid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10108_shy;It was too much, how they were just... All looking at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10108_wroth;[Root.GetFirstName], what is the MATTER with you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10109;It was all worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10110;Where did I go wrong...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10111;Then there was nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10112;I'll make [other_combatant.GetHerHim] pay for this, in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10113;Hah! I guess we will see about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10115;There's no shame in acknowledging a worthy opponent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10116_mock_duel;Again? Why not, [From.GetSisterBrother]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10118;I have to express my feelings to [other_combatant.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10118_TT;You will send a letter to §Y[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_2;So I was not being delusional...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_10120_cruel;[From.GetHerHisCap] words are inspiring! Oh, I will strive be more like [From.GetHerHim]...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HFP_10119;I would rather pretend I never received these news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_10121;It is useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_HFP_10003;I could never steal from the dead! This belongs to [home_commander.GetHerHis] family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_10103;Or... We could make a deal, if you would heed my warning?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10103_TT;You demand that §Y[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]§! forfeits all the §YStrong Claims§! [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has on any of your titles.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HF_10106;Such needless drama...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10106_TT;It was worth a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HF_10107;I am glad you show your true feelings, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_16000_A;My [craven_ruler.GetRootRelation] confesses that [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] has recently turned down another duel [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] was challenged to. I am not sure what words of comfort I can offer, but I understand [craven_ruler.GetHerHis] feelings of guilt and shame. Is this the ruler [craven_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16000_B;[craven_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] recently turned down another duel [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] was challenged to. At first I was embarrassed, on behalf of all [craven_ruler.GetHerHis] subjects, but who am I to say I would not react the same way? Perhaps there is value in choosing your battles...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16001;[From.GetTitledName] stops me in the great hall today, beckoning me to the side. In a low voice, my [From.GetRootRelation] explains that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I am right to be cautious, when all manner of villains and fools challenge my rule. "You set an example, saying that it's fair to prefer the diplomatic approach. Thank you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me a letter, containing thinly veiled accusations of cowardice. "It is no way to uphold ideals of honor, my [Root.GetLordLady], declaring the preferred course of action to be inaction."

EVTOPTA_HF_16000;Yes, one can never be too careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_16001;Thank *you*, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_16002;I... I have to do something about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HFP_DESC_30200;I am slashing my way through the enemies at the river bank, my blade covered in gore. The few enemies left are starting to back away from me, obviously terrified.

EVTDESC_HFP_double_death_intrigue_both_used_poison;There is something odd about the reluctance with which [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is fighting.
