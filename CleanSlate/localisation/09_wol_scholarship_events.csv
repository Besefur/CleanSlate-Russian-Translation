EVTDESC_WoL_6000;You have begun construction of an observatory. It will take some time to collect all the necessary materials and get everything in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6010;Your observatory is finally ready. It is with great anticipation that you prepare to make your first observations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6020;You have spent many nights looking at the stars in your observatory. It is truly fascinating, there are so many questions to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6100;Observing the movements of the stars at night, you have begun to see some regular patterns. These observations, however, have raised many new questions. You are starting to wonder, for example, if the Earth is really at the center of it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6110;The research you conduct in your observatory at night is proving deeply fascinating. You could push your studies further, but you'd need to purchase more equipment for it to be meaningful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6122;One morning, your [worried_courtier.GetRootRelation] [worried_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] comes to see you. [worried_courtier.GetSheHeCap] says: 'I am worried. I have heard that you are spending late nights studying the sky and entertaining heretical notions about the cosmos. I would ask that you stop, for your own sake.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6130;You nightly studies of the movements of the celestial bodies are increasing your knowledge of a great many things. You feel that you are getting closer to understanding the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6140;Working in your observatory, lately you are often frustrated by broken equipment, weeks on end of cloudy weather and frequent interruptions by curious intruders and even animals. It's very hard to maintain concentration and get anything done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6152;Dear [Root.GetTitledName],\nI have been told that you are pursuing studies in fields that deny the truths of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I am certain that such rumors are only slander and that you would never do such a thing. If it were true, however, I would be most disappointed.\n\nIn the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName],\n[religious_head.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6160;You studies of the celestial spheres are progressing well. You see movements and relationships that you had never dared guess at. It seems clear to you now that the laws that guide the movements of the stars must also be reflected on Earth in some way..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6170;You are sure you have made a breakthrough in your studies. Yes, it cannot be otherwise. The Earth is round, and it revolves around the Sun. How little we know of the Universe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6300;Observing the stars at night, you have begun to sense some irregular movements. You also notice that some stars seem to appear and disappear at odd times. You need to study this more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6322;One morning, your [worried_courtier.GetRootRelation] [worried_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] comes to see you. [worried_courtier.GetSheHeCap] says: 'I am worried. I have heard that you are spending late nights staring at the sky, speaking in odd riddles and entertaining heretical notions about the cosmos. I would ask that you stop, for your own sake.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6330;The studies you have conducted in your observatory have convinced you that there are many strange things beyond the known cosmos. There are few sources and no one to share knowledge with you, however. But you have heard of a strange old scholar in the Arabian Desert who is rumored to possess vast knowledge of the weird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6331;You arrive at the abode of the strange old scholar Ibrahim. After some persuasion, he invites you in. You speak at length, and he tells of you of the scholar Abdul the Mad, who knew many things of the strange spheres beyond and of talking beings that are not human. You find out that Abdul the Mad wrote a book called the Necronomicon, in which he recorded many strange and unholy truths. Ibrahim says that as he is impressed by your sincerity and desire for knowledge, he can sell you a copy of the book. He tells you to beware, however, as too much intense study of the Necronomicon is said to drive the reader insane...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6336;Shortly after the death of your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], you are brought a strange piece of news. It seems that [From.GetHerHis] library was raided, the only item stolen being a strange old book of Arabian origin. Two servants who were in the library at the time were found dead, though witnesses refused to describe the state of the bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6340;Working in your observatory, you are often disturbed by strange noises, uncannily large insects carrying away smaller pieces of equipment and odd human-like figures spying on you and then disappearing into the night before you can confront them. You really struggle to maintain concentration and get anything done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6350;The book you bought from the strange desert scholar has proven quite useful for gaining new ideas and insights in your studies of the stars and what lies beyond. It does, however, contain some quite disturbing texts and images, things that lead towards a level of understanding that might make one... mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6360;Great wisdom comes to those who study the world and learn from it. Your studies of the stars and other things beyond this world have taken you on very strange paths, and your learning has increased immeasurably since you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_6370;You are finally certain, absolutely certain. There are things you understand now that lie beyond the ken of normal [Root.GetMenWomen]. If they knew, oh if they knew! But it is the task of scholars such as you to keep and preserve such things in secret, lest all humanity go insane with the knowledge of its own insignificance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_6000;I can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6010;I wonder what strange things I will discover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6020;How do the stars move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6110;I must move forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6122;Don't worry, I'm fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6130;I sense a harmony out there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6140;I must persist, the truth is out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6152;The [religious_head.GetTitle] should stay out of my business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6160;And what is Earth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6170;I must publish my findings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6300;That star there disappears when I look directly at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6322;I am only admiring the beauty of the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6330;I will go and see him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6331;Yes, I must have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6336;Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6340;I must focus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6350;I should leave it on the shelf for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6360;The stars are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_6370;I shall be a devoted keeper of elder secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_6020;Is there something... strange out there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6110;No, this is proving too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6122;Stay out of my business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6140;It's no use!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6152;The best answer to this is silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6170;I will continue my studies in secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6322;There are strange things out there and I need to see them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6330;No, this frightens me. I should stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6331;No, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6340;It's no use, I should give this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6350;I must delve deeper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_6370;I will hide this and dedicate myself to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_WoL_6122;It is not what you think, I am only... writing poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_6152;I must not challenge conventional wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_6170;I will stop with this achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_6322;What you heard are lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_WoL_6170;No! This is [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] speaking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
